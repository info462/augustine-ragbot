of Psalms

Author(s): Augustine, St.
Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)
Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library
Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series. The first series focuses on two classical Christian
theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. St.
Augustine is one of the most influential and important Chris-
tian thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most
popular two works--the Confessions and the City of
God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and im-
portant works of St. Augustine, such as On the Holy Trinity,
Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom was an
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St.
John took a more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much
of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity, par-
ticularly what is now called social justice. He advocated for
the poor, and challenged abuses of authority. This volume
has Augustine's exposition of the entire book of Psalms.The
Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope,
and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating
texts from some of the greatest theologians of the Christian
church. These spiritually enlightening texts have aided
Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive
and fruitful even today!

Editor’s Preface.
The delightful task of editing these Enarrations, which was what I undertook, became,
indeed, a very painful one when the general editor informed me that the whole work must
be comprised in a single volume of the series. This allowed but one hundred pages to each
one of the six volumes of the Oxford translation. But I felt that my learned friend was right
(1) in deciding that St. Augustin’s treatment of the Psalms must not be wanting to the series,
and (2) that the exposition is so diffuse and digressive, that it readily admits of abridgement,
if these exceptional features supply the material for retrenchments. In working out the result,
I have “done what I could.” I have preserved the African Psalter entire, with as much of the
comment as was possible; even so overrunning, at the publishers’ cost, the six hundred pages
which were all subscribers might expect. The only means of avoiding this was to omit entirely
the CXIXth Psalm, an expedient to which I could not consent.
To the primitive believers came the Psalter, like an aftermath, wet with the dews of a
new birth as from the womb of the morning. The Spirit had descended upon it anew, as
showers upon the mown grass; and it had sprung up afresh, sweeter than before, for the
pasture of flocks. The Church received it as full of Christ, as the inheritance of a nobler and
truer Israel, for which His coming had illuminated it with a genuine interpretation, painting
even its darker and clouded surfaces with the bow of promise, now made the symbol of an
everlasting covenant and of all promises fulfilled in Him. Hence the local and temporary
meanings of the Psalms were regarded as insignificant. Their Sinaitic comminations and
their conformities to the Law were but prophecies which the Jews had voluntarily appropri-
ated by rejecting the Son of David. They were types of what had been fulfilled in their rejected
Messiah. The Church received the Psalter from the temple and the synagogue,1 and adopted
it into liturgic use, “with hymns and spiritual songs,” all magnifying the crucified and glor-
ified Christ. With the fulfillment of prophecy by the destruction of the Temple and the dis-
persion of the Jews, everything pertaining to the law was sloughed from its ripened stalk;
and the Psalter blossomed with the consummate flowers and fruitage which were its deeper
intent, and which had waited so long to be disclosed. The true David had come, and little
thought of the typical David was to be entertained: the true Israel was to be seen everywhere,
and the dead images of legal rites and symbols were to be interpreted only by the Gospel.
To bring out its hidden meanings, the reading and chanting of the Psalter received the ac-
centuation of antiphons and doxologies, and constantly elevated the worshippers into the
newness of the spirit out of the oldness of the letter. Thus the whole book breathed a
sweetness unknown to the Hebrews, but for which kings and prophets had patiently waited.
The name of Jesus disclosed itself in every reference to salvation, and perfumed these sacred

odes with a flavour that could come only from “the Root and the Offspring of David.” Such
was the Psalter to the primitive faithful: the walk of Emmaus had opened their eyes to behold
the Lord. To the true interpretation of the Psalms St. Paul had supplied the key, and from
the beginning of the Church’s institutions we find evidences of the enthusiasm with which
the Psalter was appropriated in all of the richness of its evangelic import. The earliest Fathers
are full of what the genius of Augustin has embodied in his Enarrations, which nobody must
confound with works of scientific exegesis. The author’s one idea was widely different from
that of modern critics. His “accommodations” of Scripture, as they would now be called,
are part of the system which the Church had received, of which Christ was the Alpha and
the Omega, and in which the foreshadowing David was nowhere.2 He who comes to this
volume with any other conception of its uses will be sadly disappointed. In the critical study
of the Psalms, with all of the modern helps, such as Delitzsch and others have so richly
supplied, let us not fail to exercise ourselves day and night; but if, as Christians, we wish to
catch the living Spirit that animates the “wheels” or mechanical structure of the Psalms, let
us learn from Augustin that indeed in every sense a greater than David, a “greater than So-
lomon, is here.” The fanciful ingenuity with which our author interweaves the New Testament
with the Psalms will at first provoke a smile. His ideas seem often overstrained and unnat-
ural. But let us reflect that he is animating the Church of Christ with the true “spirit of
prophecy,” which is the “testimony of Jesus;” that his object is to hang Gospel associations
upon every stem and twig that come from the root of Jesse, and to wean even the Hebrew
Christians from their instinctive references to the Law. Let us adopt these joint conceptions
of the work, and we shall find in it a glorious illustration of the Apostle’s assurance, “Ye are
not come unto the mount that burned with fire, …but unto Mount Sion, and unto the city
of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, …and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.”
In every way the divine and the student will find this work, even as here presented, a
noble introduction to patristic studies. Let us observe also what it proves. It gives us the old
African psalter in all its rude and uncouth conceptions of the Septuagint, and teaches us
how much we owe to the erudition and labours of St. Jerome. First of all, the dignity of the
Holy Scriptures, and their importance to all Christians, are assumed. Its historical values
are very great: it shows the absolute freedom of the early Church from the corruptions of
mediævalism. The Pentecostal unity of Christendom, the Catholic and Apostolic system as
defined in the constitutions of Nicæa and Constantinople, the autonomy of national
Churches, the independence of the African Church (illustrated by the personal history of
Augustin, who rejected communion with the Bishop of Rome when he stretched his claims
beyond seas), and the dogmatic primacy of the patriarchate of Carthage in Latin Christendom
as the mother of its theology, are assumed in every reflection upon the Donatists, and in
2 Compare 2 Chron. vi. 42, Isa. lv. 3, and Acts xiii. 34.
Editor’s Preface.
the tone and voice of the great preacher himself, to whom the Western Churches owe all
that survives their schism and corruptions, even to our own day. But the ethical and doctrinal
teacher will find the charm of these pages, (1) in their correspondence with the evangelical
precepts of the Sermon on the Mount, and their freedom from the tainted distinctions and
dilutions of modern casuists; (2) in their perpetual enforcement of the Pauline ideas of jus-
tification, harmonized successfully with those of St. James; (3) in the faithful exhibition of
the doctrines of grace; (4) and in the loyalty to Jesus Christ of every word; abasing human
merit, and presenting Him as “the end of the law for righteousness,” with an uncompromising
tenacity, and a persevering reiteration of this fundamental verity which seems to foresee
the gross departure of Western Churches from their original purity, and to “lay an anchor
to windward” for their restoration to orthodoxy.
The readers of this volume will need little reference to the innumerable commentaries
which have been devoted to the Psalter; but I must mention the exceptional work of the late
erudite J. Mason Neale, D.D., because it throws light on the liturgical history of the Psalter
vii
in the Western Churches. The learned commentary of the late Bishop of Lincoln, Dr.
Wordsworth, will be found to combine in a remarkable degree, with critical exposition, the
Augustinian spirit of devout evangelical associations and elevations.
The editor of this volume blesses God for much spiritual help and comfort afforded by
the review of these “songs of our pilgrimage,” with which his task has enriched the latest
years of that period of our mortality beyond which all is but labour and sorrow.

Note.
It remains to note that I have had the Benedictine edition in the types of Louvain and
of Migne constantly at hand, and have referred to them not only in all cases of doubt, but
for general refreshment of mind; the epigrammatic beauty and consonance of Augustin’s
Latin being untranslatable. From the Oxford translations I have rarely departed, and in all
important instances have noted the wherefore in the margin. It was not the design of this
series to give the reader any other than the masterly work of the scholars to whom we owe
its appearance. Other instances have been such inconsiderable adaptations as are demanded
in the suture of parts dislocated by abridgment. My brief annotations are always bracketed
and marked by an initial of my name.

It seems necessary to give the following outline of the history of this Oxford translation.
It was undertaken as part of the great series of original translations which appeared “under
the patronage of William, Archbishop of Canterbury, from its commencement, a.d. 1836,
until his Grace’s departure in peace, a.d. 1848.” It proposed to include all the “Fathers of
the Holy Catholic Church before the division of the East and West,” and this exposition
was dedicated as a memorial of Archbishop Howley in the following words:—
“To the memory of the most reverend father in God, William, Lord Archbishop of Canter-
bury, Primate of all England, formerly Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Oxford,
this Library of ancient bishops, fathers, doctors, martyrs, confessors, of Christ’s Holy Catholic
Church, undertaken amid his encouragement, and carried on for twelve years under his
sanction, until his departure hence in peace, is gratefully and reverently inscribed.”
The preface to the first volume was by the saintly Charles Marriott of Oriel College,
with whom I enjoyed some acquaintance. It is well worth preserving here,3 and is as follows:—
In any commentary on a portion of the Old Testament by a writer unacquainted with
Hebrew, exact criticism, and freedom from mistake, must not be expected. But the Psalms
have been so in the mouth and in the heart of God’s people in all languages, that it has been
necessary often to find an explanation suitable to imperfect translations. And no doubt it
is intended that we should use such explanations for the purpose of edification, when we
are unable to be more accurate, though in proving doctrine it is necessary always to remember
and allow for any want of acquaintance with the original, or uncertainty with respect to its
actual meaning. However, the main scope and bearing of the text is rarely affected by such
points as vary in different translations, and the analogy of the faith is sufficient to prevent
a Catholic4 mind from adopting any error in consequence of a text seeming to bear a het-
erodox meaning. Perhaps the errors of translation in the existing versions may have led the
Fathers to adopt rules of interpretation ranging too far from the simple and literal; but
having such translations, they could hardly use them otherwise. Meanwhile St. Augustin
will be found to excel in the intense apprehension of those great truths which pervade the
whole of Sacred Writ, and in the vivid and powerful exposition of what bears upon them.
It is hardly possible to read his practical and forcible applications of Holy Scripture, without
feeling those truths by the faith of which we ought to live brought home to the heart in a
wonderful manner. His was a mind that strove earnestly to solve the great problems of human
life, and after exhausting the resources, and discovering the emptiness, of erroneous systems,
found truth and rest at last in Catholic Christianity, in the religion of the Bible as expounded
by St. Ambrose. And though we must look to his Confessions for the full view of all his

cravings after real good, and their ultimate satisfaction, yet throughout his works we have
the benefit of the earnestness with which he sought to feed on the “sincere milk of the word.”
His mystical and allegorical interpretation, in spite of occasional mistakes, which belong
rather to the translation than to himself, will be found in general of great value. It is to a
considerable extent systematic, and the same interpretation of the same symbols is repeated
throughout the work, and is indeed often common to him with other Fathers. The “feet”
taken for the affections, “clouds” for the Apostles, and many other instances, are of very
frequent occurrence. And it is evident that a few such general interpretations must be a
great help to those who wish to make an allegorical use of those portions of Holy Scripture
which are adapted for it. Nor are they adhered to with such strictness as to deprive the
reader of the benefit of other explanations, where it appears that some other metaphor or
allegory was intended. Both St. Augustin and St. Gregory acknowledge, and at times impress
on their readers, that metaphorical language is used in Holy Scripture with various meanings
under the same symbol.
The discourses on the Psalms are not carried throughout on the same plan, but still are
tolerably complete as a commentary, since the longer expositions furnish the means of filling
out the shorter notices, in thought at least, to the attentive reader of the whole. They were
not delivered continuously, nor all at the same place. Occasionally the author is led by the
circumstances of the time into long discussions of a controversial character, especially with
respect to the Donatists, against whose narrow and exclusive views he urges strongly the
prophecies relating to the universality of the Church. Occasionally a Psalm is first reviewed
briefly, so as to give a general clew to its interpretation, and then enlarged upon in several
discourses.
For the present translation, as far as the first thirty Psalms, the editors are indebted to
a friend who conceals his name; for the remainder of the volume, with part of the next which
is to appear, to the Rev. J. E. Tweed, M.A., chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford.
Oxford, 1847.

After the first two volumes edited by Mr. Tweed of Christ Church, the third volume
(carrying the work down to the end of Psalm lxxv.) appeared with this announcement signed
by Mr. Marriott: “The whole of it, as well as a few Psalms at the end of the former and the
beginning of the following volume, is translated by T. Scratton, Esq., M.A., of Christ Church,
Oxford.” The fifth volume appeared in April, 1853, with the name of the Rev. H. M. Wilkins,
M.A., of Merton College, as translator. In December, 1857, came forth the last volume, with
the following advertisement from the pen of Dr. Pusey:—
The first hundred pages of this volume were printed, when it pleased God to withdraw
from all further toil our friend, the Rev. C. Marriott, upon whose editorial labours the Library
of the Fathers had for some years wholly depended. Full of activity in the cause of truth and

religious knowledge, full of practical benevolence, expanding himself, his strength, his pa-
ternal inheritance, in works of piety and charity, in one night his labour was closed, and he
was removed from active duty to wait in stillness for his Lord’s last call. His friends may
perhaps rather thankfully wonder that God allowed one, threatened in many ways with
severe disease, to labour for Him so long and so variously, than think it strange that He
suddenly, and for them prematurely, allowed him thus far to enter into his rest. To those
who knew him best, it has been a marvel how, with heath so frail, he was enabled in such
various ways, and for so many years, to do active good in his generation. Early called, and
ever obeying the call, he has been allowed both active duty and an early rest.
This volume, long delayed, has been completed by the Rev. H. Walford, Vice-Principal
of St. Edmund’s Hall. The principal of St. Edmund Hall, Dr. Barrow, has, with great kindness,
allowed himself to be referred to in obscure passages.
St. Augustin’s Commentary on the Psalms, then, is now, by the blessing of God, com-
pleted for the first time in an English garb. Although, as a commentary, it from time to time
fails us, because it explains minutely and verbally a translation of Holy Scripture different
from and inferior to our own, yet, on this very ground, it is the more valuable when the
translations agree. For St. Augustin was so impressed with the sense of the depth of Holy
Scripture, that when it seems to him, on the surface, plainest, then he is the more assured
of its hidden depth.5 True to this belief, St. Augustin pressed out word by word of Holy
Scripture, and that, always in dependence on the inward teaching of God the Holy Ghost
who wrote it, until he had extracted some fullness of meaning from it. More also, perhaps,
than any other work of St. Augustin, this commentary abounds in those condensed statements
of doctrinal and practical truth which are so instructive, because at once so comprehensive
and so accurate.
May He under whose gracious influence this great work was written, be with its readers
also, and make it now, as heretofore, a treasure to this portion of His Church.

St. Augustin on the Psalms.
————————————
Psalm I.
1. “Blessed is the man that hath not gone away in the counsel of the ungodly” (ver. 1).
This is to be understood of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord Man.6 “Blessed is the man that
hath not gone away in the counsel of the ungodly,” as “the man of earth did,”7 who consented
to his wife deceived by the serpent, to the transgressing the commandment of God. “Nor
stood in the way of sinners.” For He came indeed in the way of sinners, by being born as
sinners are; but He “stood” not therein, for that the enticements of the world held Him not.
“And hath not sat in the seat of pestilence.” He willed not an earthly kingdom, with pride,
which is well taken for “the seat of pestilence;” for that there is hardly any one who is free
from the love of rule, and craves not human glory. For a “pestilence” is disease widely spread,
and involving all or nearly all. Yet “the seat of pestilence” may be more appropriately under-
stood of hurtful doctrine; “whose word spreadeth as a canker.”8 The order too of the words
must be considered: “went away, stood, sat.” For he “went away,” when he drew back from
God. He “stood,” when he took pleasure in sin. He “sat,” when, confirmed in his pride, he
could not go back, unless set free by Him, who neither “hath gone away in the counsel of
the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of pestilence.”
2. “But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law will he meditate by day and
by night (ver. 2). The law is not made for a righteous man,”9 says the Apostle. But it is one
thing to be in the law, another under the law. Whoso is in the law, acteth according to the
law; whoso is under the law, is acted upon according to the law: the one therefore is free,
the other a slave. Again, the law, which is written and imposed upon the servant, is one
thing; the law, which is mentally discerned by him who needeth not its “letter,” is another
thing. “He will meditate by day and by night,” is to be understood either as without ceasing;
or “by day” in joy, “by night” in tribulations. For it is said, “Abraham saw my day, and was
glad:”10 and of tribulation it is said, “my reins also have instructed me, even unto the night.”11
3. “And he shall be like a tree planted hard by the running streams of waters” (ver. 3);
that is either Very “Wisdom,”12 which vouchsafed to assume man’s nature for our salvation;
6 Homine Dominico. This term as applied to our Lord, St. Augustin disallows in his Retractat. i. 19. [He would
not have objected to the expression of our translator, “the Lord Man,” as above. It is the adjective Dominicus to
which he objects, because it is ambiguous, quasi Man of the Lord.—C.]

that as man He might be “the tree planted hard by the running streams of waters;” for in

never thirst, but it shall be made in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”16
Or, “by the running streams of waters” may be by the sins of the people, because first the
waters are called “peoples” in the Apocalypse;17 and again, by “running stream” is not un-
reasonably understood “fall,” which hath relation to sin. That “tree” then, that is, our Lord,
from the running streams of water, that is, from the sinful people’s drawing them by the
way into the roots of His discipline, will “bring forth fruit,” that is, will establish Churches;
“in His season,” that is, after He hath been glorified by His Resurrection and Ascension into
heaven. For then, by the sending of the Holy Ghost to the Apostles, and by the confirming
of their faith in Him, and their mission to the world, He made the Churches to “bring forth
fruit.” “His leaf also shall not fall,” that is, His Word shall not be in vain. For, “all flesh is
grass, and the glory of man as the flower of grass; the grass withereth, and the flower falleth,
but the word of the Lord abideth for ever.18 And whatsoever He doeth shall prosper” that
is, whatsoever that tree shall bear; which all must be taken of fruit and leaves, that is, deeds
and words.
4. “The ungodly are not so,” they are not so, “but are like the dust which the wind casteth
forth from the face of the earth” (ver. 4). “The earth” is here to be taken as that stedfastness
in God, with a view to which it is said, “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, yea, I
have a goodly heritage.”19 With a view to this it is said, “Wait on the Lord and keep His
ways, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the earth.”20 With a view to this it is said, “Blessed
are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”21 A comparison too is derived hence, for as
this visible earth supports and contains the outer man, so that earth invisible the inner man.
“From the face of” which “earth the wind casteth forth the ungodly,” that is, pride, in that

it puffeth him up. On his guard against which he, who was inebriated by the richness of the
house of the Lord, and drunken of the torrent stream of its pleasures, saith, “Let not the foot
of pride come against me.” 22 From this earth pride cast forth him who said, “I will place
my seat in the north, and I will be like the Most High.”23 From the face of the earth it cast
forth him also who, after that he had consented and tasted of the forbidden tree that he
might be as God, hid himself from the Face of God.24 That his earth has reference to the
inner man, and that man25 is cast forth thence by pride, may be particularly seen in that
which is written, “Why is earth and ashes proud? Because, in his life, he cast forth his
bowels.”26 For, whence he hath been cast forth, he is not unreasonably said to have cast
forth himself.
5. “Therefore the ungodly rise not in the judgment” (ver. 5): “therefore,” namely, because
“as dust they are cast forth from the face of the earth.” And well did he say that this should
be taken away from them, which in their pride they court, namely, that they may judge; so
that this same idea is more clearly expressed in the following sentence, “nor sinners in the
counsel of the righteous.” For it is usual for what goes before,27 to be thus repeated more
clearly. So that by “sinners” should be understood the “ungodly;” what is before “in the
judgment,” should be here “in the counsel of the righteous.” Or if indeed the ungodly are
one thing, and sinners another, so that although every ungodly man is a sinner, yet every
sinner is not ungodly; “The ungodly rise not in the judgment,” that is, they shall rise indeed,
but not that they should be judged, for they are already appointed to most certain punish-
ment. But “sinners” do not rise “in counsel of the just,” that is, that they may judge, but
peradventure that they may be judged; so as of these it were said, “The fire shall try every
man’s work of what sort it is. If any man’s work abide, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s
work shall be burned, he shall then suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by
fire.”
6. “For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous” (ver. 6). As it is said, medicine knows
health, but knows not disease, and yet disease is recognised by the art of medicine. In like
manner can it be said that “the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,” but the way of the
ungodly He knoweth not. Not that the Lord is ignorant of anything, and yet He says to sin-
ners, “I never knew you.”28 “But the way of the ungodly shall perish;” is the same as if it

were said, the way of the ungodly the Lord knoweth not. But it is expressed more plainly
that this should be not to be known of the Lord, namely, to “perish;” and this to be known
of the Lord, namely, to “abide;” so as that to be should appertain to the knowledge of God,
but to His not knowing not to be. For the Lord saith, “I Am that I Am,” and, “I Am hath
sent me.”29

Psalm I
Psalm II.
1. “Why do the heathen rage, and the people meditate vain things?” (ver. 1). “The kings
of the earth have stood up, and the rulers taken counsel together, against the Lord, and
against His Christ” (ver. 2). It is said, “why?” as if it were said, in vain. For what they wished,
namely, Christ’s destruction, they accomplished not; for this is spoken of our Lord’s perse-
cutors, of whom also mention is made in the Acts of the Apostles.30
2. “Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their yoke from us” (ver. 3). Although
it admits of another acceptation, yet is it more fitly understood as in the person of those
who are said to “meditate vain things.” So that “let us break their bonds asunder, and cast
away their yoke from us,” may be, let us do our endeavour, that the Christian religion do
not bind us, nor be imposed upon us.
3. “He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall have
them in derision” (ver. 4). The sentence is repeated; for “He who dwelleth in the heavens,”
is afterwards put, “the Lord;” and for “shall laugh them to scorn,” is afterwards put, “shall
have them in derision.” Nothing of this however must be taken in a carnal sort, as if God
either laugheth with cheek, or derideth with nostril; but it is to be understood of that power
which He giveth to His saints, that they seeing things to come, namely, that the Name and
rule of Christ is to pervade posterity and possess all nations, should understand that those
men “meditate a vain thing.” For this power whereby these things are foreknown is God’s
“laughter” and “derision.” “He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn.” If
by “heavens” we understand holy souls, by these God, as foreknowing what is to come, will
“laugh them to scorn, and have them in derision.”
4. “Then He shall speak unto them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure”
(ver. 5). For showing more clearly how He will “speak unto them,” he added, He will “vex
them;” so that “in His wrath,” is, “in His sore displeasure.” But by the “wrath and sore dis-
pleasure” of the Lord God must not be understood any mental perturbation; but the might
whereby He most justly avengeth, by the subjection of all creation to His service. For that
is to be observed and remembered which is written in the Wisdom of Solomon, “But Thou,
Lord of power, judgest with tranquillity, and with great favour orderest us.”31 The “wrath”
of God then is an emotion which is produced in the soul which knoweth the law of God,
when it sees this same law transgressed by the sinner. For by this emotion of righteous souls
many things are avenged. Although the “wrath” of God can be well understood of that
darkening of the mind, which overtakes those who transgress the law of God.
5. “Yet am I set by Him as King upon Sion, His holy hill, preaching His decree” (ver.
6). This is clearly spoken in the Person of the very Lord our Saviour Christ. But if Sion sig-
30 Acts iv. 26.

Psalm II
Psalm II
nify, as some interpret, beholding, we must not understand it of anything rather than of the
Church, where daily is the desire raised of beholding the bright glory of God, according to
that of the Apostle, “but we with open face beholding the glory of the Lord.”32 Therefore
the meaning of this is, Yet I am set by Him as King over His holy Church; which for its
eminence and stability He calleth a mountain. “Yet I am set by Him as King.” I, that is,
whose “bands” they were meditating “to break asunder,” and whose “yoke” to “cast away.”
“Preaching His decree.” Who doth not see the meaning of this, seeing it is daily practised?
6. “The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten Thee” (ver.
7). Although that day may also seem to be prophetically spoken of, on which Jesus Christ
was born according to the flesh; and in eternity there is nothing past as if it had ceased to
be, nor future as if it were not yet, but present only, since whatever is eternal, always is; yet
as “today” intimates presentiality, a divine interpretation is given to that expression, “To-
day have I begotten Thee,” whereby the uncorrupt and Catholic faith proclaims the eternal
generation of the power and Wisdom of God, who is the Only-begotten Son.
7. “Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the nations for Thine inheritance” (ver. 8). This has
at once a temporal sense with reference to the Manhood which He took on Himself, who
offered up Himself as a Sacrifice in the stead of all sacrifices, who also maketh intercession
for us; so that the words, “ask of Me,” may be referred to all this temporal dispensation,
which has been instituted for mankind, namely, that the “nations” should be joined to the
Name of Christ, and so be redeemed from death, and possessed by God. “I shall give Thee
the nations for Thine inheritance,” which so possess them for their salvation, and to bear
unto Thee spiritual fruit. “And the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.” The
same repeated, “The uttermost parts of the earth,” is put for “the nations;” but more clearly,
that we might understand all the nations. And “Thy possession” stands for “Thine inherit-
ance.”
8. “Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron,” with inflexible justice, and “Thou shalt
break them like a potter’s vessel” (ver. 9); that is, “Thou shalt break” in them earthly lusts,
and the filthy doings of the old man, and whatsoever hath been derived and inured from
the sinful clay. “And now understand, ye kings” (ver. 10). “And now;” that is, being now
renewed, your covering of clay worn out, that is, the carnal vessels of error which belong to
your past life, “now understand,” ye who now are “kings;” that is, able now to govern all
that is servile and brutish in you, able now too to fight, not as “they who beat the air, but
chastening your bodies, and bringing them into subjection.”33 “Be instructed, all ye who
judge the earth.” This again is a repetition; “Be instructed” is instead of “understand;” and
“ye who judge the earth” instead of “ye kings.” For He signifies the spiritual by “those who
32 2 Cor. iii. 18.
33 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27.
Psalm II
judge the earth.” For whatsoever we judge, is below us; and whatsoever is below the spiritual
man, is with good reason called “the earth;” because it is defiled with earthly corruption.
9. “Serve the Lord with fear;” lest what is said, “Ye kings and judges of the earth,” turn
into pride: “And rejoice with trembling” (ver. 11). Very excellently is “rejoice” added, lest
“serve the Lord with fear” should seem to tend to misery. But again, lest this same rejoicing
should run on to unrestrained inconsiderateness, there is added “with trembling,” that it
might avail for a warning, and for the careful guarding of holiness. It can also be taken thus,
“And now ye kings understand;” that is, And now that I am set as King, be ye not sad, kings
of the earth, as if your excellency were taken from you, but rather “understand and be in-
structed.” For it is expedient for you, that ye should be under Him, by whom understanding
and instruction are given you. And this is expedient for you, that ye lord it not with rashness,
but that ye “serve the Lord” of all “with fear,” and “rejoice” in bliss most sure and most pure,
with all caution and carefulness, lest ye fall therefrom into pride.
10. “Lay hold of discipline,34 lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the
righteous way” (ver. 12). This is the same as, “understand,” and, “be instructed.” For to un-
derstand and be instructed, this is to lay hold of discipline. Still in that it is said, “lay hold
of,” it is plainly enough intimated that there is some protection and defence against all things
which might do hurt unless with so great carefulness it be laid hold of. “Lest at any time the
Lord be angry,” is expressed with a doubt, not as regards the vision of the prophet to whom
it is certain, but as regards those who are warned; for they, to whom it is not openly revealed,
are wont to think with doubt of the anger of God. This then they ought to say to themselves,
let us “lay hold of discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and we perish from the
righteous way.” Now, how “the Lord be angry” is to be taken, has been said above. And “ye
perish from the righteous way.” This is a great punishment, and dreaded by those who have
had any perception of the sweetness of righteousness; for he who perisheth from the way
of righteousness, in much misery will wander through the ways of unrighteousness.
11. “When His anger shall be shortly kindled, blessed are all they who put their trust in
Him;” that is, when the vengeance shall come which is prepared for the ungodly and for
sinners, not only will it not light on those “who put their trust in” the Lord, but it will even
avail for the foundation and exaltation of a kingdom for them. For he said not, “When His
anger shall be shortly kindled,” safe “are all they who put their trust in Him,” as though they
should have this only thereby, to be exempt from punishment; but he said, “blessed;” in
which there is the sum and accumulation of all good things. Now the meaning of “shortly”

I suppose to be this, that it will be something sudden, whilst sinners will deem it far off and
long to come.
Psalm II
Psalm III.35
A psalm of David, when he fled from the face of Abessalon his son.
1. The words, “I slept, and took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up,” lead us to
believe that this Psalm is to be understood as in the Person of Christ; for they sound more
applicable to the Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, than to that history in which David’s
flight is described from the face of his rebellious son. And, since it is written of Christ’s
disciples, “The sons of the bridegroom fast not as long as the bridegroom is with them;” 36
it is no wonder if by his undutiful37 son be here meant that undutiful38 disciple who betrayed
Him. From whose face although it may be understood historically that He fled, when on
his departure He withdrew with the rest to the mountain; yet in a spiritual sense, when the
Son of God, that is the Power and Wisdom of God, abandoned the mind of Judas; when the
Devil wholly occupied him; as it is written, “The Devil entered into his heart,”39 may it be
well understood that Christ fled from his face; not that Christ gave place to the Devil, but
that on Christ’s departure the Devil took possession. Which departure, I suppose, is called
a flight in this Psalm, because of its quickness; which is indicated also by the word of our
Lord, saying, “That thou doest, do quickly.”40 So even in common conversation we say of
anything that does not come to mind, it has fled from me; and of a man of much learning
we say, nothing flies from him. Wherefore truth fled from the mind of Judas, when it ceased
to enlighten him. But Absalom, as some interpret, in the Latin tongue signifies, Patris pax,
a father’s peace. And it may seem strange, whether in the history of the kings, when Absalom
carried on war against his father; or in the history of the New Testament, when Judas was
the betrayer of our Lord; how “father’s peace” can be understood. But both in the former
place they who read carefully, see that David in that war was at peace with his son, who even
with sore grief lamented his death, saying, “O Absalom, my son, would God I had died for
thee!”41 And in the history of the New Testament by that so great and so wonderful forbear-
ance of our Lord; in that He bore so long with him as if good, when He was not ignorant of
his thoughts; in that He admitted him to the Supper in which He committed and delivered
to His disciples the figure of His Body and Blood; finally, in that He received the kiss of
peace at the very time of His betrayal; it is easily understood how Christ showed peace to

His betrayer, although he was laid waste by the intestine war of so abominable a device. And
therefore is Absalom called “father’s peace,” because his father had the peace, which he had
not.
2. “O Lord, how are they multiplied that trouble me!” (ver. 1). So multiplied indeed
were they, that one even from the number of His disciples was not wanting, who was added
to the number of His persecutors. “Many rise up against me; many say unto my soul, There
is no salvation for him in his God” (ver. 2). It is clear that if they had had any idea that He
would rise again, assuredly they would not have slain Him. To this end are those speeches,
“Let Him come down from the cross, if He be the Son of God;” and again, “He saved others,
Himself He cannot save.”42 Therefore, neither would Judas have betrayed Him, if he had
not been of the number of those who despised Christ, saying, “There is no salvation for Him
in His God.”
3. “But Thou, O Lord, art my taker.”43 It is said to God in the nature of man, for the
taking of man is, the Word made Flesh. “My glory.” Even He calls God his glory, whom the
Word of God so took, that God became one with Him. Let the proud learn, who unwillingly
hear, when it is said to them, “For what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou
didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?”44 “And the lifter up
of my head” (ver. 3). I think that this should be here taken of the human mind, which is not
unreasonably called the head of the soul;45 which so inhered in, and in a sort coalesced with,
the supereminent excellency of the Word taking man, that it was not laid aside by so great
humiliation of the Passion.
4. “With my voice have I cried unto the Lord” (ver. 4); that is, not with the voice of the
body, which is drawn out with the sound of the reverberation of the air; but with the voice
of the heart, which to men speaks not, but with God sounds as a cry. By this voice Susanna
was heard;46 and with this voice the Lord Himself commanded that prayer should be made
in closets,47 that is, in the recesses of the heart noiselessly. Nor would one easily say that
prayer is not made with this voice, if no sound of words is uttered from the body; since even
when in silence we pray within the heart, if thoughts interpose alien from the mind of one
praying, it cannot yet be said, “With my voice have I cried unto the Lord.” Nor is this rightly
said, save when the soul alone, taking to itself nothing of the flesh, and nothing of the aims
of the flesh, in prayer, speaks to God, where He only hears. But even this is called a cry by

reason of the strength of its intention. “And He heard me out of His holy mountain.” We
have the Lord Himself called a mountain by the Prophet, as it is written, “The stone that
was cut out without hands grew to the size of a mountain.”48 But this cannot be taken of
His Person, unless peradventure He would speak thus, out of myself, as of His holy mountain
He heard me, when He dwelt in me, that is, in this very mountain. But it is more plain and
unembarrassed, if we understand that God out of His justice heard. For it was just that He
should raise again from the dead the Innocent who was slain, and to whom evil had been
recompensed for good, and that He should render to the persecutor a meet reward, who
repaid Him evil for good. For we read, “Thy justice is as the mountains of God.”49
5. “I slept, and took rest”50 (ver. 5). It may be not unsuitably remarked, that it is expressly
said, “I,” to signify that of His own Will He underwent death, according to that, “Therefore
doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again. No man
taketh it from Me; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.”51 Therefore,
saith He, you have not taken Me as though against My will, and slain Me; but “I slept, and
took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up.” Scripture contains numberless instances
of sleep being put for death; as the Apostle says, “I would not have you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning them which are asleep.”52 Nor need we make any question why it is
added, “took rest,” seeing that it has already been said, “I slept.” Repetitions of this kind are
usual in Scripture, as we have pointed out many in the second Psalm. But some copies have,
“I slept, and was cast into a deep sleep.”53 And different copies express it differently, accord-
ing to the possible renderings of the Greek words, ἐγὼ δš ἐκοιμήθην καὶ ὕπνωσα. Unless
perhaps sleeping54 may be taken of one dying, but sleep55 of one dead: so that sleeping may
be the transition into sleep, as awakening is the transition into wakefulness. Let us not deem
these repetitions in the sacred writings empty ornaments of speech. “I slept, and took rest,”
is therefore well understood as “I gave Myself up to My Passion, and death ensued.” “And
I rose, for the Lord will take Me up.”56 This is the more to be remarked, how that in one
sentence the Psalmist has used a verb of past and future time. For he has said, both “I rose,”
which is the past, and “will take Me up,” which is the future; seeing that assuredly the rising

again could not be without that taking up. But in prophecy the future is well joined to the
past, whereby both are signified. Since things which are prophesied of as yet to come in
reference to time are future; but in reference to the knowledge of those who prophesy they
are already to be viewed as done. Verbs of the present tense are also mixed in, which shall
be treated of in their proper place when they occur.
6. “I will not fear the thousands of people that surround me” (ver. 6). It is written in the
Gospels how great a multitude stood around Him as He was suffering, and on the cross.
“Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God” (ver. 7). It is not said to God, “Arise,” as if asleep or
lying down, but it is usual in holy Scripture to attribute to God what He doeth in us; not
indeed universally, but where it can be done suitably; as when He is said to speak, when by
His gift Prophets speak, and Apostles, or whatsoever messengers of the truth. Hence that
text, “Would you have proof of Christ, who speaketh in me?”57 For he doth not say, of
Christ, by whose enlightening or order I speak; but he attributes at once the speaking itself
to Him, by whose gift he spake.
7. “Since Thou hast smitten all who oppose me without a cause.” It is not to be pointed
as if it were one sentence, “Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God; since Thou hast smitten all
who oppose me without a cause.” For He did not therefore save Him, because He smote
His enemies; but rather He being saved, He smote them. Therefore it belongs to what follows,
so that the sense is this; “Since Thou hast smitten all who oppose me without a cause, Thou
hast broken the teeth of the sinners;” that is, thereby hast Thou broken the teeth of the sin-
ners, since Thou hast smitten all who oppose me. It is forsooth the punishment of the op-
posers, whereby their teeth have been broken, that is, the words of sinners rending with
their cursing the Son of God, brought to nought, as it were to dust; so that we may understand
“teeth” thus, as words of cursing. Of58 which teeth the Apostle speaks, “If ye bite one another,
take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.”59 The teeth of sinners can also be taken
as the chiefs of sinners; by whose authority each one is cut off from the fellowship of godly
livers, and as it were incorporated with evil livers. To these teeth are opposed the Church’s
teeth, by whose authority believers are cut off from the error of the Gentiles and divers
opinions, and are translated into that fellowship which is the body of Christ. With these
teeth Peter was told to eat the animals when they had been killed, that is, by killing in the
Gentiles what they were, and changing them into what he was himself. Of these teeth too
of the Church it is said, “Thy teeth are as a flock of shorn sheep, coming up from the bath,
whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.”60 These are
57 2 Cor. xiii. 3.

59 Gal. v. 15.
60 Sol. Song iv. 2, vi. 6.
Psalm III
they who prescribe rightly, and as they prescribe, live; who do what is written, “Let your
works shine before men, that they may bless your Father which is in heaven.”61 For moved
by their authority, they believe God who speaketh and worketh through these men; and
separated from the world, to which they were once conformed, they pass over into the
members of the Church. And rightly therefore are they, through whom such things are
done, called teeth like to shorn sheep; for they have laid aside the burdens of earthly cares,
and coming up from the bath, from the washing away of the filth of the world by the Sacra-
ment of Baptism, every one beareth twins. For they fulfil the two commandments, of which
it is said, “On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets;”62 loving God
with all their heart, and with all their soul, and with all their mind, and their neighbour as
themselves. “There is not one barren among them,” for much fruit they render unto God.
According to this sense then it is to be thus understood, “Thou hast broken the teeth of the
sinners,” that is, Thou hast brought the chiefs of the sinners to nought, by smiting all who
oppose Me without a cause. For the chiefs according to the Gospel history persecuted Him,
whilst the lower people honoured Him.
8. “Salvation is of the Lord; and upon Thy people be Thy blessing” (ver. 8). In one sen-
tence the Psalmist has enjoined men what to believe, and has prayed for believers. For when
it is said, “Salvation is of the Lord,” the words are addressed to men. Nor does it follow,
“And upon Thy people” be “Thy blessing,” in such wise as that the whole is spoken to men,
but there is a change into prayer addressed to God Himself, for the very people to whom it
was said, “Salvation is of the Lord.” What else then doth he say but this? Let no man presume
on himself, seeing that it is of the Lord to save from the death of sin; for, “Wretched man
that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus
Christ our Lord.”63 But do Thou, O Lord, bless Thy people, who look for salvation from
Thee.
9. This Psalm can be taken as in the Person of Christ another way; which is that whole
Christ should speak.64 I mean by whole, with His body, of which He is the Head, according
to the Apostle, who says, “Ye are the body of Christ, and the members.”65 He therefore is
the Head of this body; wherefore in another place he saith, “But doing the truth in love, we
may increase in Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, from whom the whole body is
joined together and compacted.”66 In the Prophet then at once, the Church, and her Head

Psalm III
(the Church founded amidst the storms of persecution throughout the whole world, which
we know already to have come to pass), speaks, “O Lord, how are they multiplied that trouble
me! many rise up against me;” wishing to exterminate the Christian name. “Many say unto
my soul, There is no salvation for him in his God.” For they would not otherwise hope that
they could destroy the Church, branching out so very far and wide, unless they believed that
God had no care thereof. “But Thou, O Lord, art my taker;” in Christ of course. For into
that flesh67 the Church too hath been taken by the Word, “who was made flesh, and dwelt
in us;”68 for that “In heavenly places hath He made us to sit together with Him.”69 When
the Head goes before, the other members will follow; for, “Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ?”70 Justly then does the Church say, “Thou art my taker. My glory;” for she
doth not attribute her excellency to herself, seeing that she knoweth by whose grace and
mercy she is what she is. “And the lifter up of my head,” of Him, namely, who, “the First-
born from the dead,”71 ascended up into heaven. “With my voice have I cried unto the Lord,
and He heard me out of His holy mountain.” This is the prayer of all the Saints, the odour
of sweetness, which ascends up in the sight of the Lord. For now the Church is heard out
of this mountain, which is also her head; or, out of that justice of God, by which both His
elect are set free, and their persecutors punished. Let the people of God also say, “I slept,
and took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up;” that they may be joined, and cleave
to their Head.72 For to this people is it said, “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead, and Christ shall lay hold on thee.”73 Since they are taken out of sinners, of whom it
is said generally, “But they that sleep, sleep in the night.”74 Let them say moreover, “I will
not fear the thousands of people that surround me;” of the heathen verily that compass me
about to extinguish everywhere, if they could, the Christian name. But how should they be
feared, when by the blood of the martyrs in Christ, as by oil, the ardour of love is inflamed?
“Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God.” The body can address this to its own Head. For at His
rising the body was saved; who “ascended up on high, led captivity captive, gave gifts unto
men.”75 For this is said by the Prophet, in the secret purpose of God,76 until that ripe har-

vest77 which is spoken of in the Gospel, whose salvation is in His Resurrection, who
vouchsafed to die for us, shed out our Lord to the earth. “Since Thou hast smitten all who
oppose me without a cause, Thou hast broken the teeth of the sinners.” Now while the
Church hath rule, the enemies of the Christian name are smitten with confusion; and,
whether their curses or their chiefs, brought to nought. Believe then, O man, that “salvation
is of the Lord: and,” Thou, O Lord, may “Thy blessing” be “upon Thy people.”
10. Each one too of us may say, when a multitude of vices and lusts leads the resisting
mind in the law of sin, “O Lord, how are they multiplied that trouble me! many rise up
against me.” And, since despair of recovery generally creeps in through the accumulation
of vices, as though these same vices were mocking the soul, or even as though the Devil and
his angels through their poisonous suggestions were at work to make us despair, it is said
with great truth, “Many say unto my soul, There is no salvation for him in his God. But
Thou, O Lord, art my taker.” For this is our hope, that He hath vouchsafed to take the nature
of man in Christ. “My glory;” according to that rule, that no one should ascribe ought to
himself. “And the lifter up of my head;” either of Him, who is the Head of us all, or of the
spirit of each several one of us, which is the head of the soul and body. For “the head of the
woman is the man, and the head of the man is Christ.”78 But the mind is lifted up, when it
can be said already, “With the mind I serve the law of God;”79 that the rest of man may be
reduced to peaceable submission, when in the resurrection of the flesh “death is swallowed
up in victory.”80 “With my voice I have cried unto the Lord;” with that most inward and
intensive voice. “And He heard me out of His holy mountain;”81 Him, through whom He
hath succoured us, through whose mediation He heareth us. “I slept, and took rest; and
rose, for the Lord will take me up.” Who of the faithful is not able to say this, when he calls
to mind the death of his sins, and the gift of regeneration? “I will not fear the thousands of
people that surround me.” Besides those which the Church universally hath borne and
beareth, each one also hath temptations, by which, when compassed about, he may speak
these words, “Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God:” that is, make me to arise. “Since Thou
hast smitten all who oppose me without a cause:” it is well in God’s determinate82 purpose
said of the Devil and his angels; who rage not only against the whole body of Christ, but
also against each one in particular. “Thou hast broken the teeth of the sinners.” Each man

hath those that revile him, he hath too the prime authors of vice, who strive to cut him off
from the body of Christ. But “salvation is of the Lord.” Pride is to be guarded against, and
we must say, “My soul cleaved after Thee.”83 “And upon Thy people” be “Thy blessing:”
that is, upon each one of us.

Psalm III
Psalm IV.
To the end, a psalm song to84 David.
1. “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”85 For this
“end” signifies perfection, not consumption. Now it may be a question, whether every Song
be a Psalm, or rather every Psalm a Song; whether there are some Songs which cannot be
called Psalms, and some Psalms which cannot be called Songs. But the Scripture must be
attended to, if haply “Song” do not denote a joyful theme. But those are called Psalms which
are sung to the Psaltery; which the history as a high mystery declares the Prophet David to
have used. 86 Of which matter this is not the place to discourse; for it requires prolonged
inquiry, and much discussion. Now meanwhile we must look either for the words of the
Lord Man87 after the Resurrection, or of man in the Church believing and hoping on Him.
2. “When I called, the God of my righteousness heard me” (ver. 1). When I called, God
heard me, the Psalmist says, of whom is my righteousness. “In tribulation Thou hast enlarged
me.” Thou hast led me from the straits of sadness into the broad ways of joy. For, “tribulation
and straitness is on every soul of man that doeth evil.”88 But he who says, “We rejoice in
tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;” up to that where he says, “Because
the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us;”89
he hath no straits of heart, they be heaped on him outwardly by them that persecute him.
Now the change of person, for that from the third person, where he says, “He heard,” he
passes at once to the second, where he says, “Thou hast enlarged me;” if it be not done for
the sake of variety and grace, it is strange why the Psalmist should first wish to declare to
men that he had been heard, and afterwards address Him who heard him. Unless perchance,
when he had declared how he was heard, in this very enlargement of heart he preferred to
speak with God; that he might even in this way show what it is to be enlarged in heart, that
is, to have God already shed abroad in the heart, with whom he might hold converse interi-
orly. Which is rightly understood as spoken in the person of him who, believing on Christ,
has been enlightened; but in that of the very Lord Man, whom the Wisdom of God took, I
do not see how this can be suitable. For He was never deserted by It. But as His very prayer
against trouble is a sign rather of our infirmity, so also of that sudden enlargement of heart
the same Lord may speak for His faithful ones, whom He has personated also when He said,

Psalm IV
Psalm IV
“I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink,”90 and
so forth. Wherefore here also He can say, “Thou hast enlarged me,” for one of the least of
His, holding converse with God, whose “love” he has “shed abroad in his heart by the Holy
Ghost, which is given unto us.”91 “Have mercy upon me and hear my prayer.” Why does
he again ask, when already he declared that he had been heard and enlarged? It is for our
sakes, of whom it is said, “But if we hope for that we see not, we wait in patience;”92 or is it,
that in him who has believed that which is begun may be perfected?
3. “O ye sons of men, how long heavy in heart” (ver. 2). Let your93 error, says he, have
lasted at least up to the coming of the Son of God; why then any longer are ye heavy in heart?
When will ye make an end of crafty wiles, if now when the truth is present ye make it not?
“Why do ye love vanity, and seek a lie?” Why would ye be blessed by the lowest things?
Truth alone, from which all things are true, maketh blessed. For, “vanity is of deceivers, and
all is vanity.”94 “What profit hath a man of all his labour, wherewith he laboureth under the
sun?” Why then are ye held back by the love of things temporal? Why follow ye after the
last things, as though the first, which is vanity and a lie? For you would have them abide
with you, which all pass away, as doth a shadow.
4. “And know ye that the Lord hath magnified his Holy One” (ver. 3). Whom but Him,
whom He raised up from below, and placed in heaven at His right hand? Therefore doth
he chide mankind, that they would turn at length from the love of this world to Him. But
if the addition of the conjunction (for he says, “and know ye”) is to any a difficulty, he may
easily observe in Scripture that this manner of speech is usual in that language, in which the
Prophets spoke. For you often find this beginning, “And” the Lord said unto him, “And”
the word of the Lord came to him. Which joining by a conjunction, when no sentence has
gone before, to which the following one may be annexed, peradventure admirably conveys
to us, that the utterance of the truth in words is connected with that vision which goes on
in the heart. Although in this place it may be said, that the former sentence, “Why do ye
love vanity, and seek a lie?” is as if it were written, Do not love vanity, and seek a lie. And
being thus read, it follows in the most direct construction, “and know ye that the Lord hath
magnified His Holy One.” But the interposition of the Diapsalma forbids our joining this
sentence with the preceding one. For whether this be a Hebrew word, as some would have
it, which means, so be it; or a Greek word, which marks a pause in the psalmody (so as that
Psalma should be what is sung in psalmody, but Diapsalma an interval of silence in the

psalmody; that as the coupling of voices in singing is called Sympsalma, so their separation
Diapsalma, where a certain pause of interrupted continuity is marked): whether I say it be
the former, or the latter, or something else, this at least is probable, that the sense cannot
rightly be continued and joined, where the Diapsalma intervenes.95
5. “The Lord will hear me, when I cry unto Him.” I believe that we are here warned,
that with great earnestness of heart, that is, with an inward and incorporeal cry, we should
implore help of God. For as we must give thanks for enlightenment in this life, so must we
pray for rest after this life. Wherefore in the person, either of the faithful preacher of the
Gospel, or of our Lord Himself, it may be taken, as if it were written, the Lord will hear you,
when you cry unto Him.
6. “Be ye angry, and sin not” (ver. 4). For the thought occurred, Who is worthy to be
heard? or how shall the sinner not cry in vain unto the Lord? Therefore, “Be ye angry,” saith
he, “and sin not.” Which may be taken two ways: either, even if ye be angry, do not sin; that
is, even if there arise an emotion in the soul, which now by reason of the punishment of sin
is not in our power, at least let not the reason and the mind, which is after God regenerated
within, that with the mind we should serve the law of God, although with the flesh we as
yet serve the law of sin,96 consent thereunto; or, repent ye, that is, be ye angry with yourselves
for your past sins, and henceforth cease to sin. “What you say in your hearts:” there is un-
derstood, “say ye:” so that the complete sentence is, “What ye say in your hearts, that say
ye;” that is, be ye not the people of whom it is said, “with their lips they honour Me, but
their heart is far from Me.97 In your chambers be ye pricked.” This is what has been expressed
already “in heart.” For this is the chamber, of which our Lord warns us, that we should pray
within, with closed doors.98 But, “be ye pricked,” refers either to the pain of repentance,
that the soul in punishment should prick itself, that it be not condemned and tormented in
God’s judgment; or, to arousing, that we should awake to behold the light of Christ, as if
pricks were made use of. But some say that not, “be ye pricked,” but, “be ye opened,” is the
better reading; because in the Greek Psalter it is κατανύγητε, which refers to that enlargement
of the heart, in order that the shedding abroad of love by the Holy Ghost may be received.
7. “Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and hope in the Lord” (ver. 5). He says the same
in another Psalm, “the sacrifice for God is a troubled spirit.”99 Wherefore that this is the
sacrifice of righteousness which is offered through repentance it is not unreasonably here
95 [See p. 18, supra. Also A.N.F. vol. v. p. 201. St. Augustin seems to have been acquainted with Hippoly-
tus.—C.]

Psalm IV
understood. For what more righteous, than that each one should be angry with his own
sins, rather than those of others, and that in self-punishment he should sacrifice himself
unto God? Or are righteous works after repentance the sacrifice of righteousness? For the
interposition of Diapsalma100 not unreasonably perhaps intimates even a transition from
the old life to the new life: that on the old man being destroyed or weakened by repentance,
the sacrifice of righteousness, according to the regeneration of the new man, may be offered
to God; when the soul now cleansed offers and places itself on the altar of faith, to be encom-
passed by heavenly fire, that is, by the Holy Ghost. So that this may be the meaning, “Offer
the sacrifice of righteousness, and hope in the Lord;” that is, live uprightly, and hope for the
gift of the Holy Ghost, that the truth, in which you have believed, may shine upon you.
8. But yet, “hope in the Lord,” is as yet expressed without101 explanation. Now what is
hoped for, but good things? But since each one would obtain from God that good, which
he loves; and they are not easy to be found who love interior goods, that is, which belong
to the inward man, which alone should be loved, but the rest are to be used for necessity,
not to be enjoyed for pleasure; excellently did he subjoin, when he had said, “hope in the
Lord” (ver. 6), “Many say, Who showeth us good things?” This is the speech, and this the
daily inquiry of all the foolish and unrighteous; whether of those who long for the peace
and quiet of a worldly life, and from the frowardness of mankind find it not; who even in
their blindness dare to find fault with the order of events, when involved in their own de-
servings they deem the times worse than these which are past: or, of those who doubt and
despair of that future life, which is promised us; who are often saying, Who knows if it’s
true? or, who ever came from below, to tell us this? Very exquisitely then, and briefly, he
shows (to those, that is, who have interior sight), what good things are to be sought; answering
their question, who say, “Who showeth us good things?” “The light of Thy countenance,”
saith he, “is stamped on us, O Lord.” This light is the whole and true good of man, which
is seen not with the eye, but with the mind. But he says, “stamped on us,” as a penny is
stamped with the king’s image. For man was made after the image and likeness of God,102
which he defaced by sin: therefore it is his true and eternal good, if by a new birth he be
stamped. And I believe this to be the bearing of that which some understand skilfully; I
mean, what the Lord said on seeing Cæsar’s tribute money, “Render to Cæsar the things
that are Cæsar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.”103 As if He had said, In like manner
as Cæsar exacts from you the impression of his image, so also does God: that as the tribute
money is rendered to him, so should the soul to God, illumined and stamped with the light
100 [After verse 4.—C.]

103 Matt. xxii. 21.
Psalm IV
of His countenance. (Ver. 7.) “Thou hast put gladness into my heart.” Gladness then is not
to be sought without by them, who, being still heavy in heart, “love vanity, and seek a lie;”
but within, where the light of God’s countenance is stamped. For Christ dwelleth in the inner
man,104 as the Apostle says; for to Him doth it appertain to see truth, since He hath said, “I
am the truth.”105 And again, when He spake in the Apostle, saying, “Would you receive a
proof of Christ, who speaketh in me?”106 He spake not of course from without to him, but
in his very heart, that is, in that chamber where we are to pray.
9. But men (who doubtless are many) who follow after things temporal, know not to
say aught else, than, “Who showeth us good things?” when the true and certain good within
their very selves they cannot see. Of these accordingly is most justly said, what he adds next:
“From the time of His corn, of wine, and oil, they have been multiplied.” For the addition
of His, is not superfluous. For the corn is God’s: inasmuch as He is “the living bread which
came down from heaven.”107 The wine too is God’s: for, “they shall be inebriated,” he says,
“with the fatness of thine house.”108 The oil too is God’s: of which it is said, “Thou hast
fattened my head with oil.”109 But those many, who say, “Who showeth us good things?”
and who see not that the kingdom of heaven is within them: these, “from the time of His
corn, of wine, and oil, are multiplied.” For multiplication does not always betoken plentiful-
ness, and not, generally, scantiness: when the soul, given up to temporal pleasures, burns
ever with desire, and cannot be satisfied; and, distracted with manifold and anxious thought,
is not permitted to see the simple good. Such is the soul of which it is said, “For the corrupt-
ible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that
museth on many things.”110 A soul like this, by the departure and succession of temporal
goods, that is, “from the time of His corn, wine, and oil,” filled with numberless idle fancies,
is so multiplied, that it cannot do that which is commanded, “Think on the Lord in goodness,
and in simplicity of heart seek Him.”111 For this multiplicity is strongly opposed to that
simplicity. And therefore leaving these, who are many, multiplied, that is, by the desire of
things temporal, and who say, “Who showeth us good things?” which are to be sought not
with the eyes without, but with simplicity of heart within, the faithful man rejoices and says,
“In peace, together, I will sleep, and take rest” (ver. 8). For such men justly hope for all

manner of estrangement of mind from things mortal, and forgetfulness of this world’s
miseries; which is beautifully and prophetically signified under the name of sleep and rest,
where the most perfect peace cannot be interrupted by any tumult. But this is not had now
in this life, but is to be hoped for after this life. This even the words themselves, which are
in the future tense, show us. For it is not said, either, I have slept, and taken rest; or, I do
sleep, and take rest; but, “I will sleep, and take rest.” Then shall “this corruptible put on in-
corruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality; then shall death be swallowed up in
victory.”112 Hence it is said, “But if we hope for that we see not, we wait in patience.”113
10. Wherefore, consistently with this, he adds the last words, and says, “Since Thou, O
Lord, in singleness hast made me dwell in hope.” Here he does not say, wilt make; but, “hast
made.” In whom then this hope now is, there will be assuredly that which is hoped for. And
well does he say, “in singleness.” For this may refer in opposition to those many, who being
multiplied from the time of His corn, of wine, and oil, say, “Who showeth us good things?”
For this multiplicity perishes, and singleness is observed among the saints: of whom it is
said in the Acts of the Apostles, “and of the multitude of them that believed, there was one
soul, and one heart.”114 In singleness, then, and simplicity, removed, that is, from the mul-
titude and crowd of things, that are born and die, we ought to be lovers of eternity, and
unity, if we desire to cleave to the one God and our Lord.

Psalm IV
Psalm V.
1. The title of the Psalm is, “For her who receiveth the inheritance.” The Church then
is signified, who receiveth for her inheritance eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ;
that she may possess God Himself, in cleaving to whom she may be blessed, according to
that, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the earth.”115 What earth, but that of
which it is said, “Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living”?116 And again
more clearly, “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.”117 And conversely
the word Church is said to be God’s inheritance according to that, “Ask of Me, and I shall
give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.”118 Therefore is God said to be our inheritance,
because He feedeth and sustaineth119 us: and we are said to be God’s inheritance, because
He ordereth and ruleth us. Wherefore it is the voice of the Church in this Psalm called to
her inheritance, that she too may herself become the inheritance of the Lord.
2. “Hear my words, O Lord” (ver. 1). Being called she calleth upon the Lord; that the
same Lord being her helper, she may pass through the wickedness of this world, and attain
unto Him. “Understand my cry.” The Psalmist well shows what this cry is; how from within,
from the chamber of the heart, without the body’s utterance,120 it reaches unto God: for the
bodily voice is heard, but the spiritual is understood. Although this too may be God’s hearing,
not with carnal ear, but in the omnipresence of His Majesty.
3. “Attend Thou to the voice of my supplication;” that is, to that voice, which he maketh
request that God would understand: of which what the nature is, he hath already intimated,
when he said, “Understand my cry. Attend Thou to the voice of my supplication, my King,
and my God” (ver. 2). Although both the Son is God, and the Father God, and the Father
and the Son together One God; and if asked of the Holy Ghost, we must give no other answer
than that He is God; and when the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are mentioned
together, we must understand nothing else, than One God; nevertheless Scripture is wont
to give the appellation of King to the Son. According then to that which is said, “By Me man
cometh to the Father,”121 rightly is it first, “my King;” and then, “my God.” And yet has not
the Psalmist said, Attend Ye; but, “Attend Thou.” For the Catholic faith preaches not two
or three Gods, but the Very Trinity, One God. Not that the same Trinity can be together,
now the Father, now the Son, now the Holy Ghost, as Sabellius believed: but that the Father

must be none but the Father, and the Son none but the Son, and the Holy Ghost none but
the Holy Ghost, and this Trinity but One God. Hence when the Apostle had said, “Of whom
are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things,”122 he is believed to have
conveyed an intimation of the Very Trinity; and yet he did not add, to Them be glory; but,
“to Him be glory.”
4. “Because I will pray unto Thee (ver. 3). O Lord, in the morning Thou wilt hear my
voice.” What does that, which he said above, “Hear Thou,” mean, as if he desired to be heard
immediately? But now he saith, “in the morning Thou wilt hear;” not, hear Thou: and, “I
will pray unto Thee;” not, I do pray unto Thee: and, as follows, “in the morning I will stand
by Thee, and will see;” not, I do stand by Thee, and do see. Unless perhaps his former
prayer marks the invocation itself: but being in darkness amidst the storms of this world,
he perceives that he does not see what he desires, and yet does not cease to hope, “For hope
that is seen, is not hope.”123 Nevertheless, he understands why he does not see, because the
night is not yet past, that is, the darkness which our sins have merited. He says therefore,
“Because I will pray unto Thee, O Lord;” that is, because Thou art so mighty to whom I shall
make my prayer, “in the morning Thou wilt hear my voice.” Thou art not He, he says, that
can be seen by those, from whose eyes the night of sins is not yet withdrawn: when the night
then of my error is past, and the darkness gone, which by my sins I have brought upon
myself, then “Thou wilt hear my voice.” Why then did he say above not, “Thou wilt hear,”
but “hear Thou”? Is it that after the Church cried out, “hear Thou,” and was not heard, she
perceived what must needs pass away to enable her to be heard? Or is it that she was heard
above, but doth not yet understand that she was heard, because she doth not yet see by
whom she hath been heard; and what she now says, “In the morning Thou wilt hear,” she
would have thus taken, In the morning I shall understand that I have been heard? Such is
that expression, “Arise, O Lord,”124 that is, make me arise. But this latter is taken of Christ’s
resurrection: but at all events that Scripture, “The Lord your God proveth you, that He may
know whether ye love Him,”125 cannot be taken in any other sense, than, that ye by Him
may know, and that it may be made evident to yourselves, what progress ye have made in
His love.
5. “In the morning I will stand by Thee, and will see” (ver. 3). What is, “I will stand,”
but “I will not lie down”? Now what else is, to lie down, but to take rest on the earth, which
is a seeking happiness in earthly pleasures? “I will stand by,” he says, “and will see.” We
must not then cleave to things earthly, if we would see God, who is beheld by a clean heart.

Psalm V
“For Thou art not a God who hast pleasure in iniquity. The malignant man shall not dwell
near Thee, nor shall the unrighteous abide before Thine eyes. Thou hast hated all that work
iniquity, Thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie. The man of blood, and the crafty man, the
Lord will abominate” (vers. 4–6). Iniquity, malignity, lying, homicide, craft, and all the like,
are the night of which we speak: on the passing away of which, the morning dawns, that
God may be seen. He has unfolded the reason, then, why he will stand by in the morning,
and see: “For,” he says, “Thou art not a God who hast pleasure in iniquity.” For if He were
a God who had pleasure in iniquity, He could be seen even by the iniquitous, so that He
would not be seen in the morning, that is, when the night of iniquity is over.
6. “The malignant man shall not dwell near Thee:” that is, he shall not so see, as to cleave
to Thee. Hence follows, “Nor shall the unrighteous abide before Thine eyes.” For their eyes,
that is, their mind is beaten back by the light of truth, because of the darkness of their sins;
by the habitual practice of which they are not able to sustain the brightness of right under-
standing. Therefore even they who see sometimes, that is, who understand the truth, are
yet still unrighteous, they abide not therein through love of those things, which turn away
from the truth. For they carry about with them their night, that is, not only the habit, but
even the love, of sinning. But if this night shall pass away, that is, if they shall cease to sin,
and this love and habit thereof be put to flight, the morning dawns, so that they not only
understand, but also cleave to the truth.
7. “Thou hast hated all that work iniquity.” God’s hatred may be understood from that
form of expression, by which every sinner hates the truth. For it seems that she too hates
those, whom she suffers not to abide in her. Now they do not abide, who cannot bear the
truth. “Thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie.” For this is the opposite to truth. But lest any
one should suppose that any substance or nature is opposite to truth, let him understand
that “a lie” has relation to that which is not, not to that which is. For if that which is be
spoken, truth is spoken: but if that which is not be spoken, it is a lie.126 Therefore saith he,
“Thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie;” because drawing back from that which is, they turn
aside to that which is not. Many lies indeed seem to be for some one’s safety or advantage,
spoken not in malice, but in kindness: such was that of those midwives in Exodus,127 who
gave a false report to Pharaoh, to the end that the infants of the children of Israel might not
be slain.128 But even these are praised not for the fact, but for the disposition shown; since
those who only lie in this way, will attain in time to a freedom from all lying. For in those
126 [Yet on this apparently harmless principle has been built up the art of lying, in the Liguorian casuistry:
He who lays his hand on a box or table, and swears “The man is not here,” speaks a material truth, and hence is
judged innocent. See Theologia Moralis S. Alphons. de Ligorio, tom. ii. p. 35 et seqq., Paris, ed. 1852.—C.]
127 Exod. i. 19.
128 See his treatises on lying and against lying.
Psalm V
that are perfect, not even these lies are found. For to these it is said, “Let there be in your
mouth, yea, yea; nay, nay; whatsoever is more, is of evil.”129 Nor is it without reason written
in another place, “The mouth that lieth slayeth the soul:”130 lest any should imagine that
the perfect and spiritual man ought to lie for this temporal life, in the death of which no
soul is slain, neither his own, nor another’s. But since it is one thing to lie, another to conceal
the truth (if indeed it be one thing to say what is false, another not to say what is true), if
haply one does not wish to give a man up even to this visible death, he should be prepared
to conceal what is true, not to say what is false; so that he may neither give him up, nor yet
lie, lest he slay his own soul for another’s body. But if he cannot yet do this, let him at all
events admit only lies of such necessity, that he may attain to be freed even from these, if
they alone remain, and receive the strength of the Holy Ghost, whereby he may despise all
that must be suffered for the truth’s sake. In fine, there are two kinds of lies, in which there
is no great fault,131 and yet they are not without fault, either when we are in jest, or when
we lie that we may do good. That first kind, in jest, is for this reason not very hurtful, because
there is no deception. For he to whom it is said knows that it is said for the sake of the jest.
But the second kind is for this reason the more inoffensive, because it carries with it some
kindly intention. And to say truth, that which has no duplicity, cannot even be called a lie.
As if, for example, a sword be intrusted to any one, and he promises to return it, when he
who intrusted it to him shall demand it: if he chance to require his sword when in a fit of
madness, it is clear it must not be returned then, lest he kill either himself or others, until
soundness of mind be restored to him. Here then is no duplicity, because he, to whom the
sword was intrusted, when he promised that he would return it at the other’s demand, did
not imagine that he could require it when in a fit of madness. But even the Lord concealed
the truth, when He said to the disciples, not yet strong enough, “I have many things to say
unto you, but ye cannot bear them now:”132 and the Apostle Paul when he said, “I could
not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.”133 Whence it is clear that it is not
blamable, sometimes not to speak what is true. But to say what is false is not found to have
been allowed to the perfect.
8. “The man of blood, and the crafty man, the Lord will abominate.” What he said above,

Psalm V
seem to be repeated here: so that one may refer “the man of blood” to “the worker of iniquity,”
and “the crafty man” to the “lie.” For it is craft, when one thing is done, another pretended.
He used an apt word too, when he said, “will abominate.” For the disinherited are usually
called abominated. Now this Psalm is, “for her who receiveth the inheritance;” and she adds
the exulting joy of her hope, in saying, “But I, in the multitude of Thy mercy, will enter into
Thine house” (ver. 7). “In the multitude of mercy:” perhaps he means in the multitude of
perfected and blessed men, of whom that city shall consist, of which the Church is now in
travail, and is bearing few by few. Now that many men regenerated and perfected, are rightly
called the multitude of God’s mercy, who can deny; when it is most truly said, “What is man
that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him?134 I will enter into
Thine house:” as a stone into a building, I suppose, is the meaning. For what else is the house
of God than the Temple of God, of which it is said, “for the temple of God is holy,135 which
temple ye are”? Of which building He is the cornerstone,136 whom the Power and Wisdom
of God coeternal with the Father assumed.
9. “I will worship at Thy holy temple, in Thy fear.” “At the temple,” we understand as,
“near” the temple. For he does not say, I will worship “in” Thy holy temple; but, “I will
worship at Thy holy temple.” It must be understood too to be spoken not of perfection, but
of progress toward perfection: so that the words, “I will enter into Thine house,” should
signify perfection. But that this may come to a happy issue, “I will” first, he says, “worship
at Thy holy temple.” And perhaps on this account he added, “in Thy fear;” which is a great
defence to those that are advancing toward salvation. But when any one shall have arrived
there, in him comes to pass that which is written, “perfect love casteth out fear.”137 For they
do not fear Him who is now their friend, to whom it is said, “henceforth I will not call you
servants, but friends,”138 when they have been brought through to that which was promised.
10. “O Lord, lead me forth in Thy justice because of mine enemies” (ver. 8). He has here
sufficiently plainly declared that he is on his onward road, that is, in progress toward perfec-
tion, not yet in perfection itself, when he desires eagerly that he may be led forth. But, “in
Thy justice,” not in that which seems so to men. For to return evil for evil seems justice: but
it is not His justice of whom it is said, “He maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the
evil:” for even when God punishes sinners, He does not inflict His evil on them, but leaves
them to their own evil. “Behold,” the Psalmist says, “he travailed with injustice, he hath
conceived toil, and brought forth iniquity: he hath opened a ditch, and digged it, and hath

Psalm V
fallen into the pit which he wrought: his pains shall be turned on his own head, and his
iniquity shall descend on his own pate.” 139 When then God punishes, He punishes as a
judge those that transgress the law, not by bringing evil upon them from Himself, but driving
them on to that which they have chosen, to fill up the sum of their misery. But man, when
he returns evil for evil, does it with an evil will: and on this account is himself first evil, when
he would punish evil.
11. “Direct in Thy sight my way.” Nothing is clearer, than that he here sets forth that
time, in which he is journeying onward. For this is a way which is traversed not in any regions
of the earth, but in the affections of the heart. “In Thy sight,” he says, “direct my way:” that
is, where no man sees; who are not to be trusted in their praise or blame. For they can in no
wise judge of another man’s conscience, wherein the way toward God is traversed. Hence
it is added, “for truth is not in their mouth” (ver. 9). To whose judgment of course then
there is no trusting, and therefore must we fly within to conscience, and the sight of God.
“Their heart is vain.” How then can truth be in their mouth, whose heart is deceived by sin,
and the punishment of sin? Whence men are called back by that voice, “Wherefore do ye
love vanity, and seek a lie?”
12. “Their throat is an open sepulchre.” It may be referred to signify gluttony, for the
sake of which men very often lie by flattery. And admirably has he said, “an open sepulchre:”
for this gluttony is ever gaping with open mouth, not as sepulchres, which, on the reception
of corpses, are closed up. This also may be understood hereby, that with lying and blind
flattery men draw to themselves those whom they entice to sin; and as it were devour them,
when they turn them to their own way of living. And when this happens to them, since by
sin they die, those by whom they are led along, are rightly called open sepulchres: for
themselves too are in a manner lifeless, being destitute of the life of truth; and they take in
to themselves dead men, whom having slain by lying words and a vain heart, they turn unto
themselves. “With their own tongues they dealt craftily:” that is, with evil tongues. For this
seems to be signified, when he says “their own.” For the evil have evil tongues, that is, they
speak evil, when they speak craftily. To whom the Lord saith, “How can ye, being evil, speak
good things?”140
13. “Judge them, O God: let them fall from their own thoughts” (ver. 10). It is a prophecy,
not a curse. For he does not wish that it should come to pass; but he perceives what will
come to pass. For this happens to them, not because he appears to have wished for it, but
because they are such as to deserve that it should happen. For so also what he says afterwards,
“Let all that hope in Thee rejoice,” he says by way of prophecy; since he perceives that they
will rejoice. Likewise is it said prophetically, “Stir up Thy strength, and come:”141 for he saw
139 Ps. vii. 14, 15, 16.
140 Matt. xii. 34.
141 Ps. lxxx. 2.
Psalm V
that He would come. Although the words, “Let them fall from their own thoughts,” may be
taken thus also, that it may rather be believed to be a wish for their good by the Psalmist,
whilst they fall from their evil thoughts, that is, that they may no more think evil. But what
follows, “drive them out,” forbids this interpretation. For it can in no wise be taken in a fa-
vourable sense, that one is driven out by God. Wherefore it is understood to be said
prophetically, and not of ill will; when this is said, which must necessarily happen to such
as chose to persevere in those sins, which have been mentioned. “Let them,” therefore, “fall
from their own thoughts,” is, let them fall by their self-accusing thoughts, “their own con-
science also bearing witness,” as the Apostle says, “and their thoughts accusing or excusing,
in the revelation of the just judgment of God.”142
14. “According to the multitude of their ungodlinesses drive them out:” that is, drive
them out far away. For this is “according to the multitude of their ungodlinesses,”143 that
they should be driven out far away. The ungodly then are driven out from that inheritance,
which is possessed by knowing and seeing God: as diseased eyes are driven out from the
shining of the light, when what is gladness to others is pain to them. Therefore these shall
not stand in the morning,144 and see. And that expression is as great a punishment, as that
which is said, “But for me it is good to cleave to the Lord,”145 is a great reward. To this
punishment is opposed, “Enter thou into the joy of Thy Lord;”146 for similar to this expulsion
is, “Cast him into outer darkness.”147
15. “Since they have embittered Thee, O Lord: I am,” saith He, “the Bread which came
down from heaven;”148 again, “Labour for the meat which wasteth not;”149 again, “Taste
and see that the Lord is sweet.”150 But to sinners the bread of truth is bitter. Whence they
hate the mouth of him that speaketh the truth. These then have embittered God, who by
sin have fallen into such a state of sickliness, that the food of truth, in which healthy souls
delight, as if it were bitter as gall, they cannot bear.

Psalm V
16. “And let all rejoice that hope in Thee;” those of course to whose taste the Lord is
sweet. “They will exult for evermore, and Thou wilt dwell in them” (ver. 11). This will be
the exultation for evermore, when the just become the Temple of God, and He, their Indwell-
er, will be their joy. “And all that love Thy name shall glory in Thee:” as when what they
love is present for them to enjoy. And well is it said, “in Thee,” as if in possession of the in-
heritance, of which the title of the Psalm speaks: when they too are His inheritance, which
is intimated by, “Thou wilt dwell in them.” From which good they are kept back, whom
God, according to the multitude of their ungodlinesses, driveth out.
17. “For Thou wilt bless the just man” (ver. 12). This is blessing, to glory in God, and
to be inhabited by God. Such sanctification is given to the just. But that they may be justified,
a calling goes before: which is not of merit, but of the grace of God. “For all have sinned,
and want the glory of God.”151 “For whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He
justified, them He also glorified.”152 Since then calling is not of our merit, but of the goodness
and mercy of God, he went on to say, “O Lord, as with the shield of Thy good will Thou
hast crowned us.” For God’s good will goes before our good will, to call sinners to repentance.
And these are the arms whereby the enemy is overcome, against whom it is said, “Who will
bring accusation against God’s elect?” Again, “if God be for us, who can be against us? Who
spared not His Only Son, but delivered Him up for us all.”153 “For if, when we were enemies,
Christ died for us; much more being reconciled shall we be saved from wrath through
Him.”154 This is that unconquerable shield, whereby the enemy is driven back, when he
suggests despair of our salvation through the multitude of tribulations and temptations.
18. The whole contents of the Psalm, then, are a prayer that she may be heard, from the
words, “hear my words, O Lord,” unto, “my King, and my God.” Then follows a view of
those things which hinder the sight of God, that is, a knowledge that she155 is heard, from
the words, “because I shall pray unto Thee, O Lord, in the morning Thou wilt hear my
voice,” unto, “the man of blood and the crafty man the Lord will abominate.” Thirdly, she
hopes that she, who is to be the house of God, even now begins to draw near to Him in fear,
before that perfection which casteth out fear, from the words, “but I in the multitude of Thy
mercy,” unto, “I will worship at Thy holy temple in Thy fear.” Fourthly, as she is progressing
and advancing amongst those very things which she feels to hinder her, she prays that she
may be assisted within, where no man seeth, lest she be turned aside by evil tongues, for the
words, “O Lord, lead me forth in Thy justice because of my enemies,” unto, “with their

tongues they dealt craftily.” Fifthly, is a prophecy of what punishment awaits the ungodly,
when the just man shall scarcely be saved; and of what reward the just shall obtain, who,
when they were called, came, and bore all things manfully, till they were brought to the end,
from the words, “judge them, O God,” unto the end of the Psalm.
Psalm V
Psalm VI.
To the end, in the hymns of the eighth,156 a psalm to David.157
1. “Of the eighth,” seems here obscure. For the rest of this title is more clear. Now it has
seemed to some to intimate the day of judgment, that is, the time of the coming of our Lord,
when He will come to judge the quick and dead. Which coming, it is believed, is to be, after
reckoning the years from Adam, seven thousand years: so as that seven thousand years
should pass as seven days, and afterwards that time arrive as it were the eighth day. But since
it has been said by the Lord, “It is not yours to know the times, which the Father hath put
in His own power:”158 and, “But of the day and that hour knoweth no man, no, neither angel,
nor Power, neither the Son, but the Father alone:”159 and again, that which is written, “that
the day of the Lord cometh as a thief,”160 shows clearly enough that no man should arrogate
to himself the knowledge of that time, by any computation of years. For if that day is to
come after seven thousand years, every man could learn its advent by reckoning the years.
What comes then of the Son’s even not knowing this? Which of course is said with this
meaning, that men do not learn this by the Son, not that He by Himself doth not know it:
according to that form of speech, “the Lord your God trieth you that He may know;”161
that is, that He may make you know: and, “arise, O Lord;”162 that is, make us arise. When
therefore the Son is thus said not to know this day; not because He knoweth it not, but be-
cause He causeth those to know it not, for whom it is not expedient to know it, that is, He
doth not show it to them; what does that strange presumption mean, which, by a reckoning
up of years, expects the day of the Lord as most certain after seven thousand years?163
2. Be we then willingly ignorant of that which the Lord would not have us know: and
let us inquire what this title, “of the eighth,” means. The day of judgment may indeed, even
without any rash computation of years, be understood by the eighth, for that immediately
after the end of this world, life eternal being attained, the souls of the righteous will not then
be subject unto times: and, since all times have their revolution in a repetition of those seven
days, that peradventure is called the eighth day, which will not have this variety. There is
another reason, which may be here not unreasonably accepted, why the judgment should
be called the eighth, because it will take place after two generations, one relating to the body,

the other to the soul. For from Adam unto Moses the human race lived of the body, that is,
according to the flesh: which is called the outward and the old man,164 and to which the
Old Testament was given, that it might prefigure the spiritual things to come by operations,
albeit religious, yet carnal. Through this entire season, when men lived according to the
body, “death reigned,” as the Apostle saith, “even over those that had not sinned.” Now it
reigned “after the similitude of Adam’s transgression,”165 as the same Apostle saith; for it
must be taken of the period up to Moses, up to which time the works of the law, that is,
those sacraments of carnal observance, held even those bound, for the sake of a certain
mystery, who were subject to the One God. But from the coming of the Lord, from whom
there was a transition from the circumcision of the flesh to the circumcision of the heart,
the call was made, that man should live according to the soul, that is, according to the inner
man, who is also called the “new man”166 by reason of the new birth and the renewing of
spiritual conversation. Now it is plain that the number four has relation to the body, from
the four well known elements of which it consists, and the four qualities of dry, humid,
warm, cold. Hence too it is administered by four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, winter.
All this is very well known. For of the number four relating to the body we have treated
elsewhere somewhat subtilly, but obscurely: which must be avoided in this discourse, which
we would have accommodated to the unlearned. But that the number three has relation to
the mind may be understood from this, that we are commanded to love God after a threefold
manner,167 with the whole heart, with the whole soul, with the whole mind:168 of each of
which severally we must treat, not in the Psalms, but in the Gospels: for the present, for
proof of the relation of the number three to the mind, I think what has been said enough.
Those numbers then of the body which have relation to the old man and the Old Testament,
being past and gone, the numbers too of the soul, which have relation to the new man and
the New Testament, being past and gone, a septenary so to say being passed; because
everything is done in time, four having been distributed to the body, three to the mind; the
eighth will come, the day of judgment: which assigning to deserts their due, will transfer at
once the saint, not to temporal works, but to eternal life; but will condemn the ungodly to
eternal punishment.
3. In fear of which condemnation the Church prays in this Psalm, and says, “Reprove
me not, O Lord, in Thine anger” (ver. 1). The Apostle too mentions the anger of the judg-
ment; “Thou treasurest up unto thyself,” he says, “anger against the day of the anger of the

just judgment of God.”169 In which he would not be reproved, whosoever longs to be healed
in this life. “Nor in Thy rage chasten me.” “Chasten,” seems rather too mild a word; for it
availeth toward amendment. For for him who is reproved, that is, accused, it is to be feared
lest his end be condemnation. But since “rage” seems to be more than “anger,” it may be a
difficulty, why that which is milder, namely, chastening, is joined to that which is more
severe, namely, rage. But I suppose that one and the same thing is signified by the two words.
For in the Greek θυμὸς, which is in the first verse, means the same as ὀργὴ, which is in the
second verse.170 But when the Latins themselves too wished to use two distinct words, they
looked out for what was akin to “anger,” and “rage”171 was used. Hence copies vary. For in
some “anger” is found first, and then “rage:” in others, for “rage,” “indignation” or “choler”
is used. But whatever the reading, it is an emotion of the soul urging to the infliction of
punishment. Yet this emotion must not be attributed to God, as if to a soul, of whom it is
said, “but Thou, O Lord of power, judgest with tranquillity.”172 Now that which is tranquil,
is not disturbed. Disturbance then does not attach to God as judge: but what is done by His
ministers, in that it is done by His laws, is called His anger. In which anger, the soul, which
now prays, would not only not be reproved, but not even chastened, that is, amended or
instructed. For in the Greek it is, παιδεύσῃς, that is, instruct. Now in the day of judgment
all are “reproved” that hold not the foundation, which is Christ. But they are amended, that
is, purged, who “upon this foundation build wood, hay, stubble. For they shall suffer loss,
but shall be saved, as by fire.”173 What then does he pray, who would not be either reproved
or amended in the anger of the Lord? what else but that he may be healed? For where sound
health is, neither death is to be dreaded, nor the physician’s hand with caustics or the knife.
4. He proceeds accordingly to say, “Pity me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord,
for my bones are troubled” (ver. 2), that is, the support of my soul, or strength: for this is
the meaning of “bones.” The soul therefore says, that her strength is troubled, when she
speaks of bones. For it is not to be supposed, that the soul has bones, such as we see in the
body. Wherefore, what follows tends to explain it, “and my soul is troubled exceedingly”
(ver. 3), lest because he mentioned bones, they should be understood as of the body. “And
Thou, O Lord, how long?” Who does not see represented here a soul struggling with her
diseases; but long kept back by the physician, that she may be convinced what evils she has
plunged herself into through sin? For what is easily healed, is not much avoided: but from
the difficulty of the healing, there will be the more careful keeping of recovered health. God

Psalm VI
then, to whom it is said, “And Thou, O Lord, how long?” must not be deemed as if cruel:
but as a kind convincer of the soul, what evil she hath procured for herself. For this soul
does not yet pray so perfectly, as that it can be said to her, “Whilst thou art yet speaking I
will say, Behold, here I am.”174 That she may at the same time also come to know, if they
who do turn meet with so great difficulty, how great punishment is prepared for the ungodly,
who will not turn to God: as it is written in another place, “If the righteous scarcely be saved,
where shall the sinner and ungodly appear?”175
5. “Turn, O Lord, and deliver my soul” (ver. 4). Turning herself she prays that God too
would turn to her: as it is said, “Turn ye unto Me, and I will turn unto you, saith the Lord.”176
Or is it to be understood according to that way of speaking, “Turn, O Lord,” that is make
me turn, since the soul in this her turning feels difficulty and toil? For our perfected turning
findeth God ready, as says the Prophet, “We shall find Him ready as the dawn.”177 Since it
was not His absence who is everywhere present, but our turning away that made us lose
Him; “He was in this world,” it is said, “and the world was made by Him, and the world
knew Him not.”178 If, then, He was in this world, and the world knew Him not, our impurity
doth not endure the sight of Him. But whilst we are turning ourselves, that is, by changing
our old life are fashioning our spirit; we feel it hard and toilsome to be wrested back from
the darkness of earthly lusts, to the serene and quiet and tranquillity of the divine light. And
in such difficulty we say, “Turn, O Lord,” that is, help us, that that turning may be perfected
in us, which findeth Thee ready, and offering Thyself for the fruition of them that love Thee.
And hence after he said, “Turn, O Lord,” he added, “and deliver my soul:” cleaving as it
were to the entanglements of this world, and suffering, in the very act of turning, from the
thorns, as it were, of rending and tearing desires. “Make me whole,” he says, “for Thy pity’s
sake.” He knows that it is not of his own merits that he is healed: for to him sinning, and
transgressing a given command, was just condemnation due. Heal me therefore, he says,
not for my merit’s sake, but for Thy pity’s sake.
6. “For in death there is no one that is mindful of Thee” (ver. 5). He knows too that now
is the time for turning unto God: for when this life shall have passed away, there remaineth
but a retribution of our deserts.179 “But in hell who shall confess to Thee?”180 That rich

Psalm VI
man, of whom the Lord speaks, who saw Lazarus in rest, but bewailed himself in torments,
confessed in hell, yea so as to wish even to have his brethren warned, that they might keep
themselves from sin, because of the punishment which is not believed to be in hell. Although
therefore to no purpose, yet he confessed that those torments had deservedly lighted upon
him; since he even wished his brethren to be instructed, lest they should fall into the same.
What then is, “But in hell who will confess to Thee?” Is hell to be understood as that place,
whither the ungodly will be cast down after the judgment, when by reason of that deeper
darkness they will no more see any light of God, to whom they may confess aught? For as
yet that rich man by raising his eyes, although a vast gulf lay between, could still see Lazarus
established in rest: by comparing himself with whom, he was driven to a confession of his
own deserts. It may be understood also, as if the Psalmist calls sin, that is committed in
contempt of God’s law, death: so as that we should give the name of death to the sting of
death, because it procures death. “For the sting of death is sin.”181 In which death this is to
be unmindful of God, to despise His law and commandments: so that by hell the Psalmist
would mean that blindness of soul which overtakes and enwraps the sinner, that is, the dying.
“As they did not think good,” the Apostle says, “to retain God in” their “knowledge, God
gave them over to a reprobate mind.”182 From this death, and this hell, the soul earnestly
prays that she may be kept safe, whilst she strives to turn to God, and feels her difficulties.
7. Wherefore he goes on to say, “I have laboured in my groaning.” And as if this availed
but little, he adds, “I will wash each night my couch” (ver. 6). That is here called a couch,
where the sick and weak soul rests, that is, in bodily gratification and in every worldly
pleasure. Which pleasure, whoso endeavours to withdraw himself from it, washes with tears.
For he sees that he already condemns carnal lusts; and yet his weakness is held by the
pleasure, and willingly lies down therein, from whence none but the soul that is made whole
can rise. As for what he says, “each night,” he would perhaps have it taken thus: that he who,
ready in spirit, perceives some light of truth, and yet, through weakness of the flesh, rests
sometime in the pleasure of this world, is compelled to suffer as it were days and nights in
an alternation of feeling: as when he says, “With the mind I serve the law of God,” he feels
as it were day; again when he says, “but with the flesh the law of sin,”183 he declines into
night: until all night passeth away, and that one day comes, of which it is said, “In the
morning I will stand by Thee, and will see.”184 For then he will stand, but now he lies down,
when he is on his couch; which he will wash each night, that with so great abundance of
tears he may obtain the most assured remedy from the mercy of God. “I will drench my bed
181 1 Cor. xv. 56.
182 Rom. i. 28.
183 Rom. vii. 25.
184 Ps. v. 3.
Psalm VI
with tears.” It is a repetition.185 For when he says, “with tears,” he shows with what meaning
he said above, “I will wash.” For we take “bed” here to be the same as “couch” above. Al-
though, “I will drench,” is something more than, “I will wash:” since anything may be washed
superficially, but drenching penetrates to the more inward parts; which here signifies
weeping to the very bottom of the heart. Now the variety of tenses which he uses; the past,
when he said, “I have laboured in my groaning;” and the future, when he said, “I will wash
each night my couch;” the future again, “I will drench my bed with tears;” this shows what
every man ought to say to himself, when he labours in groaning to no purpose. As if he
should say, It hath not profited when I have done this, therefore I will do the other.
8. “Mine eye is disordered by anger” (ver. 7): is it by his own, or God’s anger, in which
he maketh petition that he might not be reproved, or chastened? But if anger in that place
intimate the day of judgment, how can it be understood now? Is it a beginning of it, that
men here suffer pains and torments, and above all the loss of the understanding of the truth;
as I have already quoted that which is said, “God gave them over to a reprobate mind”?186
For such is the blindness of the mind. Whosoever is given over thereunto, is shut out from
the interior light of God: but not wholly as yet, whilst he is in this life. For there is “outer
darkness,”187 which is understood to belong rather to the day of judgment; that he should
rather be wholly without God, whosoever whilst there is time refuses correction. Now to be
wholly without God, what else is it, but to be in extreme blindness? If indeed God “dwell in
inaccessible light,”188 whereinto they enter, to whom it is said, “Enter thou into the joy of
thy Lord.”189 It is then the beginning of this anger, which in this life every sinner suffers.
In fear therefore of the day of judgment, he is in trial and grief; lest he be brought to that,
the disastrous commencement of which he experiences now. And therefore he did not say,
mine eye is extinguished, but, “mine eye is disordered by anger.” But if he mean that his eye
is disordered by his own anger, there is no wonder either in this. For hence perhaps it is
said, “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath;”190 because the mind, which, from her
own disorder, is not permitted to see God, supposes that the inner sun, that is, the wisdom
of God, suffers as it were a setting in her.

Psalm VI
9. “I have grown old in all mine enemies.” He had only spoken of anger (if it were yet
of his own anger that he spoke): but thinking on his other vices, he found that he was en-
trenched by them all. Which vices, as they belong to the old life and the old man, which we
must put off, that we may put on the new man,191 it is well said, “I have grown old.” But
“in all mine enemies,” he means, either amidst these vices, or amidst men who will not be
converted to God. For these, even if they know them not, even if they bear with them, even
if they use the same tables and houses and cities, with no strife arising between them, and
in frequent converse together with seeming concord: notwithstanding, by the contrariety
of their aims, they are enemies to those who turn unto God. For seeing that the one love
and desire this world, the others wish to be freed from this world, who sees not that the first
are enemies to the last? For if they can, they draw the others into punishment with them.
And it is a great grace, to be conversant daily with their words, and not to depart from the
way of God’s commandments. For often the mind which is striving to go on to God-ward,
being rudely handled in the very road, is alarmed; and generally fulfils not its good intent,
lest it should offend those with whom it lives, who love and follow after other perishable
and transient goods. From such every one that is whole is separated, not in space, but in
soul. For the body is contained in space, but the soul’s space is her affection.
10. Wherefore after the labour, and groaning, and very frequent showers of tears, since
that cannot be ineffectual, which is asked so earnestly of Him, who is the Fountain of all
mercies, and it is most truly said, “the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart:”192
after difficulties so great, the pious soul, by which we may also understand the Church, in-
timating that she has been heard, see what she adds: “Depart from me, all ye that work
iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping” (ver. 8). It is either spoken
prophetically, since they will depart, that is, the ungodly will be separated from the righteous,
when the day of judgment arrives, or, for this time present. For although both are equally
found in the same assemblies, yet on the open floor the wheat is already separated from the
chaff, though it be hid among the chaff. They can therefore be associated together, but
cannot be carried away by the wind together.
11. “For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping; The Lord hath heard my supplic-
ation; the Lord hath received my prayer” (ver. 9). The frequent repetition of the same senti-
ments shows not, so to say, the necessities of the narrator, but the warm feeling of his joy.
For they that rejoice are wont so to speak, as that it is not enough for them to declare once
for all the object of their joy. This is the fruit of that groaning in which there is labour, and
those tears with which the couch is washed, and bed drenched: for, “he that sows in tears,
shall reap in joy:” 193 and, “blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.”

Psalm VI
12. “Let all mine enemies be ashamed and vexed” (ver. 10). He said above, “depart from
me all ye:” which can take place, as it has been explained, even in this life: but as to what he
says, “let them be ashamed and vexed,” I do not see how it can happen, save on that day
when the rewards of the righteous and the punishments of the sinners shall be made manifest.
For at present so far are the ungodly from being ashamed, that they do not cease to insult
us. And for the most part their mockings are of such avail, that they make the weak to be
ashamed of the name of Christ. Hence it is said, “Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me before
men, of him will I be ashamed before My Father.”194 But now whosoever would fulfil those
sublime commands, to disperse, to give to the poor, that his righteousness may endure for
ever;195 and selling all his earthly goods, and spending them on the needy, would follow
Christ, saying, “We brought nothing into this world, and truly we can carry nothing out;
having food and raiment, let us be therewith content;”196 incurs the profane raillery of those
men, and by those who will not be made whole, is called mad; and often to avoid being so
called by desperate men, he fears to do, and puts off that, which the most faithful and
powerful of all physicians hath ordered. It is not then at present that these can be ashamed,
by whom we have to wish that we be not made ashamed, and so be either called back from
our proposed journey, or hindered, or delayed. But the time will come when they shall be
ashamed, saying as it is written, “These are they whom we had sometimes in derision, and
a parable of reproach: we fools counted their life madness, and their end to be without
honour: how are they numbered among the children of God, and their lot is among the
saints? Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath
not shined into us, nor the sun risen upon us: we have been filled with the way of wickedness
and destruction, and have walked through rugged deserts, but the way of the Lord we have
not known. What hath pride profited us, or what hath the vaunting of riches brought us?
All those things are passed away like a shadow.”197
13. But as to what he says, “Let them be turned and confounded,” who would not judge
it to be a most righteous punishment, that they should have a turning unto confusion, who
would not have one unto salvation? After this he added, “exceeding quickly.” For when the
day of judgment shall have begun to be no longer looked for, when they shall have said,
“Peace, then shall sudden destruction come upon them.”198 Now whensoever it come, that
comes very quickly, of whose coming we give up all expectation; and nothing makes the
length of this life be felt but the hope of living. For nothing seems more quick, than all that

has already passed in it. When then the day of judgment shall come, then will sinners feel
how that all the life which passeth away is not long. Nor will that any way possibly seem to
them to have come tardily, which shall have come without their desiring, or rather without
their believing. Although it can too be taken in this place thus, that inasmuch as God has
heard, so to say, her groans, and her long and frequent tears, she may be understood to be
freed from her sins, and to have tamed every disordered impulse of carnal affection: as she
saith, “Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping:” and when she has had this happy issue, it is no marvel if she be already so perfect
as to pray for her enemies. The words then, “Let all mine enemies be ashamed, and vexed,”
may have this meaning; that they should repent of their sins, which cannot be effected
without confusion and vexation. There is then nothing to hinder us from taking what follows
too in this sense, “let them be turned and ashamed,” that is, let them be turned to God, and
be ashamed that they sometime gloried in the former darkness of their sins; as the Apostle
says, “For what glory had ye sometime in those things of which ye are now ashamed?”199
But as to what he added, “exceeding quickly,” it must be referred either to the warm affection
of her wish, or to the power of Christ; who converteth to the faith of the Gospel in such
quick time the nations, which in their idols’ cause did persecute the Church.
199 Rom. vi. 21.
Psalm VI
Psalm VII.
A psalm to David himself, which he sung to the Lord, for the words of Chusi, son of
Jemini.200
1. Now the story which gave occasion to this prophecy may be easily recognised in the
second book of Kings.201 For there Chusi, the friend of king David, went over to the side
of Abessalon, his son, who was carrying on war against his father, for the purpose of discov-
ering and reporting the designs which he was taking against his father, at the instigation of
Achitophel, who had revolted from David’s friendship, and was instructing by his counsel,
to the best of his power, the son against the father. But since it is not the story itself which
is to be the subject of consideration in this Psalm, from which the prophet hath taken a veil
of mysteries, if we have passed over to Christ, let the veil be taken away.202 And first let us
inquire into the signification of the very names, what it means. For there have not been
wanting interpreters, who investigating these same words, not carnally according to the
letter, but spiritually, declare to us that Chusi should be interpreted silence; and Gemini,
right-handed; Achitophel, brother’s ruin. Among which interpretations, Judas, that traitor,
again meets us, that Abessalon should bear his image, according to that interpretation of it
as a father’s peace; in that his father was full of thoughts of peace toward him: although he
in his guile had war in his heart, as was treated of in the third Psalm. Now as we find in the
Gospels that the disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ are called sons,203 so in the same Gospels
we find they are called brethren also. For the Lord on the resurrection saith, “Go and say to
My brethren.”204 And the Apostle calls Him “the first begotten among many brethren.”
The ruin then of that disciple, who betrayed Him, is rightly understood to be a brother’s
ruin, which we said is the interpretation of Achitophel. Now as to Chusi, from the interpret-
ation of silence, it is rightly understood that our Lord contended against that guile in silence,
that is, in that most deep secret, whereby “blindness happened in part to Israel,”205 when
they were persecuting the Lord, that the fulness of the Gentiles might enter in, and “so all
Israel might be saved.” When the Apostle came to this profound secret and deep silence, he
exclaimed, as if struck with a kind of awe of its very depth, “O the depth of the riches of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past
finding out! For who hath known the wind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor?”
206 Thus that great silence he does not so much discover by explanation, as he sets forth its
200 [See Neale’s note on this title. Commentary on the Psalms, vol. i. p. 131.—C.]

greatness in admiration. In this silence the Lord, hiding the sacrament of His adorable pas-
sion, turns the brother’s voluntary ruin, that is, His betrayer’s impious wickedness, into the
order of His mercy and providence: that what he with perverse mind wrought for one Man’s
destruction, He might by providential overruling dispose for all men’s salvation. The perfect
soul then, which is already worthy to know the secret of God, sings a Psalm unto the Lord,
she sings “for the words of Chusi,” because she has attained to know the words of that silence:
for among unbelievers and persecutors there is that silence and secret. But among His own,
to whom it is said, “Now I call you no more servants; for the servant knoweth not what his
lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of My Father I have
made known unto you: 207 among His friends, I say, there is not the silence, but the words
of the silence, that is, the meaning of that silence set forth and manifested. Which silence,
that is, Chusi, is called the son of Gemini, that is, righthanded. For what was done for the
Saints was not to be hidden from them. And yet He saith, “Let not the left hand know what
the right hand doeth.”208 The perfect soul then, to which that secret has been made known,
sings in prophecy “for the words of Chusi,” that is, for the knowledge of that same secret.
Which secret God at her right hand, that is, favourable209 and propitious unto her, has
wrought. Wherefore this silence is called the Son of the right hand, which is, “Chusi, the
son of Gemini.”
2. “O Lord my God, in Thee have I hoped: save me from all them that persecute me,
and deliver me” (ver. 1). As one to whom, already perfected, all the war and enmity of vice
being overcome, there remaineth no enemy but the envious devil, he says, “Save me from
all them that persecute me, and deliver me (ver. 2): lest at any time he tear my soul as a lion.”
The Apostle says, “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
he may devour.”210 Therefore when the Psalmist said in the plural number, “Save me from
all them that persecute me:” he afterwards introduced the singular, saying, “lest at any time
he tear my soul as a lion.” For he does not say, lest at any time they tear: he knew what enemy
and violent adversary of the perfect soul remained. “Whilst there be none to redeem, nor
to save:” that is, lest he tear me, whilst Thou redeemest not, nor savest. For, if God redeem
not, nor save, he tears. 211

Psalm VII
3. And that it might be clear that the already perfect soul, which is to be on her guard
against the most insidious snares of the devil only, says this, see what follows. “O Lord my
God, if I have done this” (ver. 3). What is it that he calls “this”? Since he does not mention
the sin by name, are we to understand sin generally? If this sense displease us, we may take
that to be meant which follows: as if we had asked, what is this that you say, “this”? He an-
swers, “If there be iniquity in my hands.” Now then it is clear that it is said of all sin, “If I
have repaid them that recompense me evil” (ver. 4). Which none can say with truth, but the
perfect. For so the Lord says, “Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in heaven; who maketh
His sun to rise upon the good and the evil, and raineth on the just and the unjust.” 212 He
then who repayeth not them that recompense evil, is perfect. When therefore the perfect
soul prays “for the words of Chusi, the son of Jemini,” that is, for the knowledge of that
secret and silence, which the Lord, favourable to us and merciful, wrought for our salvation,
so as to endure, and with all patience bear, the guiles of this betrayer: as if He should say to
this perfect soul, explaining the design of this secret, For thee ungodly and a sinner, that
thine iniquities might be washed away by My blood-shedding, in great silence and great
patience I bore with My betrayer; wilt not thou imitate me, that thou too mayest not repay
evil for evil? Considering then, and understanding what the Lord has done for him, and by
His example going on to perfection, the Psalmist says, “If I have repaid them that recompense
me evil:” that is, if I have not done what Thou hast taught me by Thy example: “may I
therefore fall by mine enemies empty.” And he says well, not, If I have repaid them that do
me evil; but, who “recompense.” For who so recompenseth, had received somewhat already.
Now it is an instance of greater patience, not even to repay him evil, who after receiving
benefits returns evil for good, than if without receiving any previous benefit he had had a
mind to injure. If therefore he says, “I have repaid them that recompense me evil:” that is,
If I have not imitated Thee in that silence, that is, in Thy patience, which Thou hast wrought
for me, “may I fall by mine enemies empty.” For he is an empty boaster, who, being himself
a man, desires to avenge himself on a man; and whilst he openly seeks to overcome a man,
is secretly himself overcome by the devil, rendered empty by vain and proud joy, because
he could not, as it were, be conquered. The Psalmist knows then where a greater victory
may be obtained, and where “the Father which seeth in secret will reward.” 213 Lest then he
repay them that recompense evil, he overcomes his anger rather than another man, being
instructed too by those writings, wherein it is written, “Better is he that overcometh his anger,
than he that taketh a city.”214 “If I have repaid them that recompense me evil, may I therefore
fall by my enemies empty.” He seems to swear by way of execration, which is the heaviest
212 Matt. v. 43, 45.
213 Matt. vi. 6.
214 Prov. xvi. 32.
Psalm VII
kind of oath, as when one says, If I have done so and so, may I suffer so and so. But swearing
in a swearer’s mouth is one thing, in a prophet’s meaning another. For here he mentions
what will really befall men who repay them that recompense evil; not what, as by an oath,
he would imprecate on himself or any other.
4. “Let the enemy” therefore “persecute my soul and take it” (ver. 5). By again naming
the enemy in the singular number, he more and more clearly points out him whom he spoke
of above as a lion. For he persecutes the soul, and if he has deceived it, will take it. For the
limit of men’s rage is the destruction of the body; but the soul, after this visible death, they
cannot keep in their power: whereas whatever souls the devil shall have taken by his perse-
cutions, he will keep. “And let him tread my life upon the earth:” that is, by treading let him
make my life earth, that is to say, his food. For he is not only called a lion, but a serpent too,
to whom it was said, “Earth shalt thou eat.”215 And to the sinner was it said, “Earth thou
art, and into earth shalt thou go.”216 “And let him bring down my glory to the dust.” This
is that dust which “the wind casteth forth from the face of the earth,”217 to wit, vain and
silly boasting of the proud, puffed up, not of solid weight, as a cloud of dust carried away
by the wind. Justly then has he here spoken of the glory, which he would not have brought
down to dust. For he would have it solidly established in conscience before God, where there
is no boasting. “He that glorieth,” saith the Apostle, “let him glory in the Lord.”218 This
solidity is brought down to the dust if one through pride despising the secrecy of conscience,
where God only proves a man, desires to glory before men. Hence comes what the Psalmist
elsewhere says, “God shall bruise the bones of them that please men.”219 Now he that has
well learnt or experienced the steps in overcoming vices, knows that this vice of empty glory
is either alone, or more than all, to be shunned by the perfect. For that by which the soul
first fell, she overcomes the last. “For the beginning of all sin is pride:” and again, “The be-
ginning of man’s pride is to depart from God.”220
5. “Arise, O Lord, in Thine anger” (ver. 6). Why yet does he, who we say is perfect, incite
God to anger? Must we not see, whether he rather be not perfect, who, when he was being
stoned, said, “O Lord, lay not this sin to their charge”?221 Or does the Psalmist pray thus
not against men, but against the devil and his angels, whose possession sinners and the un-
godly are? He then does not pray against him in wrath, but in mercy, whosoever prays that

that possession may be taken from him by that Lord “who justifieth the ungodly.”222 For
when the ungodly is justified, from ungodly he is made just, and from being the possession
of the devil he passes into the temple of God. And since it is a punishment that a possession,
in which one longs to have rule, should be taken away from him: this punishment, that he
should cease to possess those whom he now possesses, the Psalmist calls the anger of God
against the devil. “Arise, O Lord; in Thine anger.” “Arise” (he has used it as “appear”), in
words, that is, human and obscure; as though God sleeps, when He is unrecognised and
hidden in His secret workings. “Be exalted in the borders of mine enemies.” He means by
borders the possession itself, in which he wishes that God should be exalted, that is, be
honoured and glorified, rather than the devil, while the ungodly are justified and praise
God. “And arise, O Lord my God, in the commandment that Thou hast given:” that is, since
Thou hast enjoined humility, appear in humility; and first fulfil what Thou hast enjoined;
that men by Thy example overcoming pride may not be possessed of the devil, who against
Thy commandments advised to pride, saying, “Eat, and your eyes shall be opened, and ye
shall be as gods.”223
6. “And the congregation of the people shall surround Thee.” This may be understood
two ways. For the congregation of the people can be taken, either of them that believe, or
of them that persecute, both of which took place in the same humiliation of our Lord: in
contempt of which the multitude of them that persecute surrounded Him; concerning which
it is said, “Why have the heathen raged, and the people meditated vain things?” 224 But of
them that believe through His humiliation the multitude so surrounded Him, that it could
be said with the greatest truth, “blindness in part is happened unto Israel, that the fulness
of the Gentiles might come in:”225 and again, “Ask of me, and I will give Thee the Gentiles
for Thine inheritance, and the boundaries of the earth for Thy possession.”226 “And for
their sakes return Thou on high:” that is, for the sake of this congregation return Thou on
high: which He is understood to have done by His resurrection and ascension into heaven.
For being thus glorified He gave the Holy Ghost, which before His exaltation could not be
given, as it is written in the Gospel, “for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus
was not yet glorified.”227 Having then returned on high for the sake of the congregation of
the people, He sent the Holy Ghost: by whom the preachers of the Gospel being filled, filled
the whole world with Churches.

Psalm VII
7. It can be taken also in this sense: “Arise, O Lord, in Thine anger, and be exalted in
the borders of mine enemies:” that is, arise in Thine anger, and let not mine enemies under-
stand Thee; so that to “be exalted,” should be this, become high,228 that Thou mayest not
be understood; which has reference to the silence spoken of above. For it is of this exaltation
thus said in another Psalm, “And He ascended upon Cherubim, and flew:” and, “He made
darkness His secret place.”229 In which exaltation, or concealment, when for their sins’
desert they shall not understand Thee, who shall crucify Thee, “the congregation” of believers
“shall surround Thee.” For in His very humiliation He was exalted, that is, was not under-
stood. So that, “And arise, O Lord my God, in the commandment that Thou hast given:”
may have reference to this, that is, when Thou showest Thyself, be high or deep that mine
enemies may not understand Thee. Now sinners are the enemies of the just man, and the
ungodly of the godly man. “And the congregation of the people shall surround Thee:” that
is, by this very circumstance, that those who crucify Thee understand Thee not, the Gentiles
shall believe on Thee, and so “shall the congregation of the people surround Thee.” But
what follows, if this be the true meaning, has in it more pain, that it begins already to be
perceived, than joy that it is understood. For it follows, “and for their sakes return Thou on
high,” that is, and for the sake of this congregation of the human race, wherewith the
Churches are crowded, return Thou on high, that is, again cease to be understood. What
then is, “and for their sakes,” but that this congregation too will offend Thee, so that Thou
mayest most truly foretell and say, “Thinkest Thou when the Son of man shall come, He
will find faith on the earth?”230 Again, of the false prophets, who are understood to be
heretics, He says, “Because of their iniquity the love of many shall wax cold.”231 Since then
even in the Churches, that is, in that congregation of peoples and nations, where the
Christian name has most widely spread, there shall be so great abundance of sinners, which
is already, in great measure, perceived; is not that famine of the word232 here predicted,
which has been threatened by another prophet also? Is it not too for this congregation’s
sake, who, by their sins, are estranging from themselves that light of truth, that God returns
on high, that is, so that faith, pure and cleansed from the corruption of all perverse opinions,
is held and received, either not at all, or by the very few of whom it was said, “Blessed is he
that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved”? 233 Not without cause then is it said,
“and for the sake of this” congregation “return Thou on high:” that is, again withdraw into
228 Altus. Its twofold meaning of “high” and “deep” is not capable of being preserved in translation.

Psalm VII
the depth of Thy secrecy, even for the sake of this congregation of the peoples, that hath
Thy name, and doeth not Thy deeds.
8. But whether the former exposition of this place, or this last be the more suitable,
without prejudice to any one better, or equal, or as good, it follows very consistently, “the
Lord judgeth the people.” For whether He returned on high, when, after the resurrection,
He ascended into heaven, well does it follow, “The Lord judgeth the people:” for that He
will come from thence to judge the quick and the dead. Or whether He return on high, when
the understanding of the truth leaves sinful Christians, for that of His coming it has been
said, “Thinkest thou the Son of Man on His coming will find faith on the earth?”234 “The
Lord” then “judgeth the people.” What Lord, but Jesus Christ? “For the Father judgeth no
man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.”235 Wherefore this soul which prayeth
perfectly, see how she fears not the day of judgment, and with a truly secure longing says
in her prayer, “Thy kingdom come: judge me,” she says, “O Lord, according to my righteous-
ness.” In the former Psalm a weak one was entreating, imploring rather the mercy of God,
than mentioning any desert of his own: since the Son of God came “to call sinners to repent-
ance.”236 Therefore he had there said, “Save me, O Lord, for Thy mercy’s sake;”237 that is,
not for my desert’s sake. But now, since being called he hath held and kept the command-
ments which he received, he is bold to say, “Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness,
and according to my harmlessness, that is upon me.” This is true harmlessness, which harms
not even an enemy. Accordingly, well does he require to be judged according to his harm-
lessness, who could say with truth, “If I have repaid them that recompense me evil.” As for
what he added, “that is upon me,” it can refer not only to harmlessness, but can be understood
also with reference to righteousness; that the sense should be this, Judge me, O Lord, accord-
ing to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness, which righteousness and
harmlessness is upon me. By which addition he shows that this very thing, that the soul is
righteous and harmless, she has not by herself, but by God who giveth brightness and light.
For of this he says in another Psalm, “Thou, O Lord, wilt light my candle.”238 And of John
it is said, that “he was not the light, but bore witness of the light.”239 “He was a burning and
shining candle.”240 That light then, whence souls, as candles, are kindled, shines forth not
with borrowed, but with original, brightness, which light is truth itself. It is then so said,

Psalm VII
“According to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness, that is upon me,” as if
a burning and shining candle should say, Judge me according to the flame which is upon
me, that is, not that wherewith241 I am myself, but that whereby I shine enkindled of thee.
9. “But let the wickedness of sinners be consummated” (ver. 9). He says, “be consum-
mated,” be completed, according to that in the Apocalypse, “Let the righteous become more
righteous, and let the filthy be filthy still.”242 For the wickedness of those men appears
consummate, who crucified the Son of God; but greater is theirs who will not live uprightly,
and hate the precepts of truth, for whom the Son of God was crucified. “Let the wickedness
of sinners,” then he says, “be consummated,” that is, arrive at the height of wickedness, that
just judgment may be able to come at once. But since it is not only said, “Let the filthy be
filthy still;” but it is said also, “Let the righteous become more righteous;” he joins on the
words, “And Thou shalt direct the righteous, O God, who searcheth the hearts and reins.”
How then can the righteous be directed but in secret? when even by means of those things
which, in the commencement of the Christian ages, when as yet the saints were oppressed
by the persecution of the men of this world, appeared marvellous to men, now that the
Christian name has begun to be in such high dignity, hypocrisy, that is pretence, has in-
creased; of those, I mean, who by the Christian profession had rather please men than God.
How then is the righteous man directed in so great confusion of pretence, save whilst God
searcheth the hearts and reins; seeing all men’s thoughts, which are meant by the word heart;
and their delights, which are understood by the word reins? For the delight in things tem-
poral and earthly is rightly ascribed to the reins; for that it is both the lower part of man,
and that region where the pleasure of carnal generation dwells, through which man’s nature
is transferred into this life of care, and deceiving joy, by the succession of the race. God then,
searching our heart, and perceiving that it is there where our treasure is, that is, in heaven;
searching also the reins, and perceiving that we do not assent to flesh and blood, but delight
ourselves in the Lord, directs the righteous man in his inward conscience before Him, where
no man seeth, but He alone who perceiveth what each man thinketh, and what delighteth
each. For delight is the end of care; because to this end does each man strive by care and
thought, that he may attain to his delight. He therefore seeth our cares, who searcheth the
heart. He seeth too the ends of cares, that is delights, who narrowly searcheth the reins; that
when He shall find that our cares incline neither to the lust of the flesh, nor to the lust of
the eyes, nor to the pride of life,243 all which pass away as a shadow, but that they are raised
upward to the joys of things eternal, which are spoilt by no change, He may direct the
righteous, even He, the God who searcheth the hearts and reins. For our works, which we

242 Rev. xxii. 11.
243 1 John ii. 16.
Psalm VII
do in deeds and words, may be known unto men; but with what mind they are done, and
to what end we would attain by means of them, He alone knoweth, the God who searcheth
the hearts and reins.
10. “My righteous help is from the Lord, who maketh whole the upright in heart” (ver.
10). The offices of medicine are twofold, on the curing infirmity, the other the preserving
health. According to the first it was said in the preceding Psalm, “Have mercy on me, O
Lord, for I am weak;”244 according to the second it is said in this Psalm, “If there be iniquity
in my hands, if I have repaid them that recompense me evil, may I therefore245 fall by my
enemies empty.” For there the weak prays that he may be delivered, here one already whole
that he may not change for the worse. According to the one it is there said, “Make me whole
for Thy mercy’s sake;” according to this other it is here said, “Judge me, O Lord, according
to my righteousness.” For there he asks for a remedy to escape from disease; but here for
protection from falling into disease. According to the former it is said, “Make me whole, O
Lord, according to Thy mercy:” according to the latter it is said, “My righteous help is from
the Lord, who maketh whole the upright in heart.” Both the one and the other maketh men
whole; but the former removes them from sickness into health, the latter preserves them in
this health. Therefore there the help is merciful, because the sinner hath no desert, who as
yet longeth to be justified, “believing on Him who justifieth the ungodly;”246 but here the
help is righteous, because it is given to one already righteous. Let the sinner then who said,
“I am weak,” say in the first place, “Make me whole, O Lord, for Thy mercy’s sake;” and
here let the righteous man, who said, “If I have repaid them that recompense me evil,” say,
“My righteous help is from the Lord, who maketh whole the upright in heart.” For if he sets
forth the medicine, by which we may be healed when weak, how much more that by which
we may be kept in health. For if “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, how much
more being now justified shall we be kept whole from wrath through Him.”247
11. “My righteous help is from the Lord, who maketh whole the upright in heart.” God,
who searcheth the hearts and reins, directeth the righteous; but with righteous help maketh
He whole the upright in heart. He doth not as He searcheth the hearts and reins, so make
whole the upright in heart and reins; for the thoughts are both bad in a depraved heart, and
good in an upright heart; but delights which are not good belong to the reins, for they are
more low and earthly; but those that are good not to the reins, but to the heart itself.
Wherefore men cannot be so called upright in reins, as they are called upright in heart, since
where the thought is, there at once the delight is too; which cannot be, unless when things
244 Ps. vi. 2.
245 Al. deservedly.
246 Rom. iv. 5.
247 Rom. v. 8, 9.
Psalm VII
divine and eternal are thought of. “Thou hast given,” he says, “joy in my heart,” when he
had said, “The light of Thy countenance has been stamped on us, O Lord.”248 For although
the phantoms of things temporal, which the mind falsely pictures to itself, when tossed by
vain and mortal hope, to vain imagination oftentimes bring a delirious and maddened joy;
yet this delight must be attributed not to the heart, but to the reins; for all these imaginations
have been drawn from lower, that is, earthly and carnal things. Hence it comes, that God,
who searcheth the hearts and reins, and perceiveth in the heart upright thoughts, in the
reins no delights, affordeth righteous help to the upright in heart, where heavenly249 delights
are coupled with clean thoughts. And therefore when in another Psalm he had said,
“Moreover even to-night my reins have chided me;” he went on to say as touching help, “I
foresaw the Lord alway in my sight, for He is on my right hand, that I should not be
moved.”250 Where he shows that he suffered suggestions only from the reins, not delights
as well; for he had suffered these, then he would of course be moved. But he said, “The Lord
is on my right hand, that I should not be moved;” and then he adds, “Wherefore was my
heart delighted;” that the reins should have been able to chide, not delight him. The delight
accordingly was produced not in the reins, but there, where against the chiding of the reins
God was foreseen to be on the right hand, that is, in the heart.
12. “God the righteous judge, strong251 (in endurance) and long-suffering” (ver. 11).
What God is judge, but the Lord, who judgeth the people? He is righteous; who “shall render
to every man according to his works.”252 He is strong (in endurance); who, being most
powerful, for our salvation bore even with ungodly persecutors. He is long-suffering; who
did not immediately, after His resurrection, hurry away to punishment, even those that
persecuted Him, but bore with them, that they might at length turn from that ungodliness
to salvation: and still He beareth with them, reserving the last penalty for the last judgment,
and up to this present time inviting sinners to repentance. “Not bringing in anger every
day.” Perhaps “bringing in anger” is a more significant expression than being angry (and
so we find it in the Greek253 copies); that the anger, whereby He punisheth, should not be
in Him, but in the minds of those ministers who obey the commandments of truth through
whom orders are given even to the lower ministries, who are called angels of wrath, to
punish sin: whom even now the punishment of men delights not for justice’ sake, in which
they have no pleasure, but for malice’ sake. God then doth not “bring in anger every day,”

250 Ps. xvi. 7, 8.
251 Fortis.
252 Matt. xvi. 27.
253 μὴ ὀργὴν ἐπ€γων, LXX.
Psalm VII
that is, He doth not collect His ministers for vengeance every day. For now the patience of
God inviteth to repentance: but in the last time, when men “through their hardness and
impenitent heart shall have treasured up for themselves anger in the day of anger, and rev-
elation of the righteous judgment of God,254 then He will brandish His sword.”
13. “Unless ye be converted,” He says, “He will brandish His sword” (ver. 12). The Lord
Man Himself may be taken to be God’s double-edged sword, that is, His spear, which at His
first coming He will not brandish, but hideth as it were in the sheath of humiliation: but He
will brandish it, when at the second coming to judge the quick and dead, in the manifest
splendour of His glory, He shall flash light on His righteous ones, and terror on the ungodly.
For in other copies, instead of, “He shall brandish His sword,” it has been written, “He shall
make bright His spear:” by which word I think the last coming of the Lord’s glory most ap-
propriately signified: seeing that is understood of His person, which another Psalm has,
“Deliver, O Lord, my soul from the ungodly,255 Thy spear from the enemies of Thine hand.
He hath bent His bow, and made it ready.” The tenses of the words must not be altogether
overlooked, how he has spoken of “the sword” in the future, “He will brandish;” of “the
bow” in the past, “He hath bent:” and these words of the past tense follow after.256
14. “And in it He hath prepared the instruments of death: He hath wrought His arrows
for the burning” (ver. 13). That bow then I would readily take to be the Holy Scripture, in
which by the strength of the New Testament, as by a sort of string, the hardness of the Old
has been bent and subdued. From thence the Apostles are sent forth like arrows, or divine
preachings are shot. Which arrows “He has wrought for the burning,” arrows, that is, whereby
being stricken they might be inflamed with heavenly love. For by what other arrows was
she stricken, who saith, “Bring me into the house of wine, place me among perfumes, crowd
me among honey, for I have been wounded with love”?257 By what other arrows is he kindled,
who, desirous of returning to God, and coming back from wandering, asketh for help against
crafty tongues, and to whom it is said, “What shall be given thee, or what added to thee
against the crafty tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with devastating coals:”258 that is,
coals, whereby, when thou art stricken and set on fire, thou mayest burn with so great love
of the kingdom of heaven, as to despise the tongues of all that resist thee, and would recall
thee from thy purpose, and to deride their persecutions, saying, “Who shall separate me
from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,
or peril, or sword? For I am persuaded,” he says, “that neither death, nor life, nor angel, nor

Psalm VII
principality, nor things present, not things to come, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor
other creature, shall be able to separate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord.”259 Thus for the burning hath He wrought His arrows. For in the Greek copies
it is found thus, “He hath wrought His arrows for the burning.” But most of the Latin cop-
ies260 have “burning arrows.” But whether the arrows themselves burn, or make others
burn, which of course they cannot do unless they burn themselves, the sense is complete.
15. But since he has said that the Lord has prepared not arrows only, but “instruments
of death” too, in the bow, it may be asked, what are “instruments of death”? Are they, per-
adventure, heretics? For they too, out of the same bow, that is, out of the same Scriptures,
light upon souls not to be inflamed with love but destroyed with poison: which does not
happen but after their deserts: wherefore even this dispensation is to be assigned to the Divine
Providence, not that it makes men sinners, but that it orders them after they have sinned.
For through sin reaching them with an ill purpose, they are forced to understand them ill,
that this should be itself the punishment of sin: by whose death, nevertheless, the sons of
the Catholic Church are, as it were by certain thorns, so to say, aroused from slumber, and
make progress toward the understanding of the holy Scriptures. “For there must be also
heresies, that they which are approved,” he says, “may be made manifest among you:”261
that is, among men, seeing they are manifest to God. Or has He haply ordained the same
arrows to be at once instruments of death for the destruction of unbelievers, and wrought
them burning, or for the burning, for the exercising of the faithful? For that is not false that
the Apostle says, “To the one we are the savour of life unto life, to the other the savour of
death unto death; and who is sufficient for these things?”262 It is no wonder then if the same
Apostles be both instruments of death in those from whom they suffered persecution, and
fiery arrows to inflame the hearts of believers.
16. Now after this dispensation righteous judgment will come: of which the Psalmist so
speaks, as that we may understand that each man’s punishment is wrought out of his own
sin, and his iniquity turned into vengeance: that we may not suppose that that tranquillity
and ineffable light of God brings forth from Itself the means of punishing sin; but that it so
ordereth sins, that what have been delights to man in sinning, should be instruments to the
Lord avenging. “Behold,” he says, “he hath travailed with injustice.” Now what had he con-
ceived, that he should travail with injustice? “He hath conceived,” he says, “toil.” Hence
then comes that, “In toil shall thou eat thy bread.”263 Hence too that, “Come unto Me all
259 Rom. viii. 35, 38, 39.
260 [Not so the Vulgate nor St. Jerome, which follow the Greek. He refers to the African (old Italic) Psalters.

262 2 Cor. ii. 16.
263 Gen. iii. 17.
Psalm VII
ye that toil and are heavy laden; for My yoke is easy, and My burden light.”264 For toil will
never cease, except one love that which cannot be taken away against his will. For when
those things are loved which we can lose against our will, we must needs toil for them most
miserably; and to obtain them, amid the straitnesses of earthly cares, whilst each desires to
snatch them for himself, and to be beforehand with another, or to wrest it from him, must
scheme injustice. Duly then, and quite in order, hath he travailed with injustice, who has
conceived toil. Now he bringeth forth what, save that with which he hath travailed, although
he has not travailed with that which he conceived? For that is not born, which is not con-
ceived; but seed is conceived, that which is formed from the seed is born. Toil is then the
seed of iniquity, but sin the conception of toil, that is, that first sin, to “depart from God.”265
He then hath travailed with injustice, who hath conceived toil. “And he hath brought forth
iniquity.” “Iniquity” is the same as “injustice:” he hath brought forth then that with which
he travailed. What follows next?
17. “He hath opened a ditch, and digged it” (ver. 15). To open a ditch is, in earthly
matters, that is, as it were in the earth, to prepare deceit, that another fall therein, whom the
unrighteous man wishes to deceive. Now this ditch is opened when consent is given to the
evil suggestion of earthly lusts: but it is digged when after consent we press on to actual
work of deceit. But how can it be, that iniquity should rather hurt the righteous man against
whom it proceeds, than the unrighteous heart whence it proceeds? Accordingly, the stealer
of money, for instance, while he desires to inflict painful harm upon another, is himself
maimed by the wound of avarice. Now who, even out of his right mind, sees not how great
is the difference between these men, when one suffers the loss of money, the other of inno-
cence? “He will fall” then “into the pit which he hath made.” As it is said in another Psalm,
“The Lord is known in executing judgments; the sinner is caught in the works of his own
hands.”266
18. “His toil shall be turned on his head, and his iniquity shall descend on his pate” (ver.
16). For he had no mind to escape sin: but was brought under sin as a slave, so to say, as the
Lord saith, “Whosoever sinneth is a slave.”267 His iniquity then will be upon him, when he
is subject to his iniquity; for he could not say to the Lord, what the innocent and upright
say, “My glory, and the lifter up of my head.”268 He then will be in such wise below, as that
his iniquity may be above, and descend on him; for that it weigheth him down and burdens

Psalm VII
him, and suffers him not to fly back to the rest of the saints. This occurs, when in an ill
regulated man reason is a slave, and lust hath dominion.
19. “I will confess to the Lord according to His justice” (ver. 17). This is not the sinner’s
confession: for he says this, who said above most truly, “If there be iniquity in my hands:”
but it is a confession of God’s justice, in which we speak thus, Verily, O Lord, Thou art just,
in that Thou both so protectest the just, that Thou enlightenest them by Thyself; and so
orderest sinners, that they be punished not by Thine, but by their own malice. This confession
so praises the Lord, that the blasphemies of the ungodly can avail nothing, who, willing to
excuse their evil deeds, are unwilling to attribute to their own fault that they sin, that is, are
unwilling to attribute their fault to their fault. Accordingly they find either fortune or fate
to accuse, or the devil, to whom He who made us hath willed that it should be in our power
to refuse consent: or they bring in another nature, which is not of God: wretched waverers,
and erring, rather than confessing to God, that He should pardon them. For it is not fit that
any be pardoned, except he says, I have sinned. He, then, that sees the deserts of souls so
ordered by God, that while each has his own given him, the fair beauty of the universe is in
no part violated, in all things praises God: and this is not the confession of sinners, but of
the righteous. For it is not the sinner’s confession when the Lord says, “I confess to Thee,
O Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise, and revealed
them to babes.” 269 Likewise in Ecclesiasticus it is said, “Confess to the Lord in all His works:
and in confession ye shall say this, All the works of the Lord are exceeding good.”270 Which
can be seen in this Psalm, if any one with a pious mind, by the Lord’s help, distinguish
between the rewards of the righteous and the penalties of the sinners, how that in these two
the whole creation, which God made and rules, is adorned with a beauty wondrous and
known to few. Thus then he says, “I will confess to the Lord according to His justice,” as
one who saw that darkness was not made by God, but ordered nevertheless. For God said,
“Let light be made, and light was made.”271 He did not say, Let darkness be made, and
darkness was made: and yet He ordered it. And therefore it is said, “God divided between
the light, and the darkness: and God called the light day, and the darkness He called night.”272
This is the distinction, He made the one and ordered it: but the other He made not, but yet
He ordered this too. But now that sins are signified by darkness, so is it seen in the Prophet,
who says, “And thy darkness shall be as the noon day:”273 and in the Apostle, who says, “He
that hateth his brother is in darkness:”274 and above all that text, “Let us cast off the works

of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.”275 Not that there is any nature of darkness.
For all nature, in so far as it is nature, is compelled to be. Now being belongs to light: not
being to darkness. He then that leaves Him by whom he was made, and inclines to that
whence he was made, that is, to nothing, is in this sin endarkened: and yet he does not utterly
perish, but he is ordered among the lowest things. Therefore after the Psalmist said, “I will
confess unto the Lord:” that we might not understand it of confession of sins, he adds lastly,
“And I will sing to the name of the Lord most high.” Now singing has relation to joy, but
repentance of sins to sadness.
20. This Psalm can also be taken in the person of the Lord Man: if only that which is
there spoken in humiliation be referred to our weakness, which He bore.276

276 [On the continuity of the first seven Psalms, see Bishop Wordsworth’s Commentary, p. 10, ed. London,
Psalm VII
Psalm VIII.
To the end, for the wine-presses, a psalm of David himself.277
1. He seems to say nothing of wine-presses in the text of the Psalm of which this is the
title. By which it appears, that one and the same thing is often signified in Scripture by many
and various similitudes. We may then take wine-presses to be Churches, on the same principle
by which we understand also by a threshing-floor the Church. For whether in the threshing-
floor, or in the wine-press, there is nothing else done but the clearing the produce of its
covering; which is necessary, both for its first growth and increase, and arrival at the maturity
either of the harvest or the vintage. Of these coverings or supporters then; that is, of chaff,
on the threshing-floor, the corn; and of husks, in the presses, the wine is stripped: as in the
Churches, from the multitude of worldly men, which is collected together with the good,
for whose birth and adaptating to the divine word that multitude was necessary, this is ef-
fected, that by spiritual love they be separated through the operation of God’s ministers.
For now so it is that the good are, for a time, separated from the bad, not in space, but in
affection: although they have converse together in the Churches, as far as respects bodily
presence. But another time will come, the corn will be stored up apart in the granaries, and
the wine in the cellars. “The wheat,” saith he, “He will lay up in garners; but the chaff He
will burn with fire unquenchable.” 278 The same thing may be thus understood in another
similitude: the wine He will lay up in cellars, but the husks He will cast forth to cattle: so
that by the bellies of the cattle we may be allowed by way of similitude to understand the
pains of hell.
2. There is another interpretation concerning the wine-presses, yet still keeping to the
meaning of Churches. For even the Divine Word may be understood by the grape: for the
Lord even has been called a Cluster of grapes; which they that were sent before by the people
of Israel brought from the land of promise hanging on a staff, crucified as it were.279 Accord-
ingly, when the Divine Word maketh use of, by the necessity of declaring Himself, the sound
of the voice, whereby to convey Himself to the ears of the hearers; in the same sound of the
voice, as it were in husks, knowledge, like the wine, is enclosed: and so this grape comes
into the ears, as into the pressing machines of the wine-pressers. For there the separation
is made, that the sound may reach as far as the ear; but knowledge be received in the memory
of those that hear, as it were in a sort of vat; whence it passes into discipline of the conversa-
tion and habit of mind, as from the vat into the cellar: where if it do not through negligence
grow sour, it will acquire soundness by age. For it grew sour among the Jews, and this sour

probably sung at the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles.—C.]

vinegar they gave the Lord to drink.280 For that wine, which from the produce of the vine
of the New Testament the Lord is to drink with His saints in the kingdom of His Father,281
must needs be most sweet and most sound.
3. “Wine-presses” are also usually taken for martyrdoms, as if when they who have
confessed the name of Christ have been trodden down by the blows of persecution, their
mortal remains as husks remained on earth, but their souls flowed forth into the rest of a
heavenly habitation. Nor yet by this interpretation do we depart from the fruitfulness of the
Churches. It is sung then, “for the wine-presses,” for the Church’s establishment; when our
Lord after His resurrection ascended into heaven. For then He sent the Holy Ghost: by
whom the disciples being fulfilled preached with confidence the Word of God, that Churches
might be collected.
4. Accordingly it is said, “O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is Thy Name in all the earth!”
(ver. 1). I ask, how is His Name wonderful in all the earth? The answer is, “For Thy glory
has been raised above the heavens.” So that the meaning is this, O Lord, who art our Lord,
how do all that inhabit the earth admire Thee! for Thy glory hath been raised from earthly
humiliation above the heavens. For hence it appeared who Thou wast that descendedst,
when it was by some seen, and by the rest believed, whither it was that Thou ascendedst.
5. “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast made perfect praise, because of
Thine enemies” (ver. 2). I cannot take babes and sucklings to be any other than those to
whom the Apostle says, “As unto babes in Christ I have given you milk to drink, not meat.”282
Who were meant by those who went before the Lord praising Him, of whom the Lord
Himself used this testimony, when He answered the Jews who bade Him rebuke them, “Have
ye not read, out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast made perfect praise?”283
Now with good reason He says not, Thou hast made, but, “Thou hast made perfect praise.”
For there are in the Churches also those who now no more drink milk, but eat meat: whom
the same Apostle points out, saying, “We speak wisdom among them that are perfect;”284
but not by those only are the Churches perfected; for if there were only these, little consid-
eration would be had of the human race. But consideration is had, when they too, who are
not as yet capable of the knowledge of things spiritual and eternal, are nourished by the
faith of the temporal history, which for our salvation after the Patriarchs and Prophets was
administered by the most excellent Power and Wisdom of God, even in the Sacrament of
the assumed Manhood, in which there is salvation for every one that believeth; to the end

that moved by Its authority each one may obey Its precepts, whereby being purified and
“rooted and grounded in love,” he may be able to run with Saints, no more now a child in
milk, but a young man in meat, “to comprehend the breadth, the length, the height, and
depth, to know also the surpassing knowledge of the love of Christ.”285
6. “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast made perfect praise, because of
Thine enemies.” By enemies to this dispensation, which has been wrought through Jesus
Christ and Him crucified, we ought generally to understand all who forbid belief in things
unknown,286 and promise certain knowledge:287 as all heretics do, and they who in the su-
perstition of the Gentiles are called philosophers. Not that the promise of knowledge is to
be blamed; but because they deem the most healthful and necessary step of faith is to be
neglected, by which we must needs ascend to something certain, which nothing but that
which is eternal can be. Hence it appears that they do not possess even this knowledge,
which in contempt of faith they promise; seeing that they know not so useful and necessary
a step thereof. “Out of the mouth,” then “of babes and sucklings Thou hast made perfect
praise,” Thou, our Lord, declaring first by the Apostle, “Except ye believe, ye shall not un-
derstand;”288 and saying by His own mouth, “Blessed are they that have not seen, and shall
believe.”289 “Because of the enemies:” against whom too that is said, “I confess to Thee, O
Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise, and revealed
them unto babes.”290 “From the wise,” he saith, not the really wise, but those who deem
themselves such. “That Thou mayest destroy the enemy and the defender.” Whom but the
heretic?291 For he is both an enemy and a defender, who when he would assault the Chris-
tian faith, seems to defend it. Although the philosophers too of this world may be well taken
as the enemies and defenders: forasmuch as the Son of God is the Power and Wisdom of
God by which every one is enlightened who is made wise by the truth: of which they profess
themselves to be lovers, whence too their name of philosophers; and therefore they seem to
defend it, while they are its enemies, since they cease not to recommend noxious superstitions,
that the elements of this world should be worshipped and revered.
7. “For I shall see Thy heavens, the works of Thy fingers” (ver. 3). We read that the law
was written with the finger of God, and given through Moses, His holy servant: by which

finger of God many understand the Holy Ghost.292 Wherefore if, by the fingers of God, we
are right in understanding these same ministers filled with the Holy Ghost, by reason of
this same Spirit which worketh in them, since by them all holy Scripture has been completed
for us; we understand consistently with this, that, in this place, the books of both Testaments
are called “the heavens.” Now it is said too of Moses himself, by the magicians of king
Pharaoh, when they were conquered by him, “This is the finger of God.” 293 And what is
written, “The heavens shall be rolled up as a book.”294 Although it be said of this æthereal
heaven, yet naturally, according to the same image, the heavens of books are named by al-
legory. “For I shall see,” he says, “the heavens, the works of Thy fingers:” that is, I shall discern
and understand the Scriptures, which Thou, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, hast written
by Thy ministers.
8. Accordingly the heavens named above also may be interpreted as the same books,
where he says, “For Thy glory hath been raised above the heavens:” so that the complete
meaning should be this, “For Thy glory hath been raised above the heavens;” for Thy glory
hath exceeded the declarations of all the Scriptures: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
Thou hast made perfect praise,” that they should begin by belief in the Scriptures, who would
arrive at the knowledge of Thy glory: which hath been raised above the Scriptures, in that
it passeth by and transcends the announcements of all words and languages. Therefore hath
God lowered the Scriptures even to the capacity of babes and sucklings, as it is sung in an-
other Psalm, “And He lowered the heaven, and came down:”295 and this did He because of
the enemies, who through pride of talkativeness, being enemies of the cross of Christ, even
when they do speak some truth, still cannot profit babes and sucklings. So is the enemy and
defender destroyed, who, whether he seem to defend wisdom, or even the name of Christ,
still, from the step of this faith,296 assaults that truth, which he so readily makes promise
of. Whereby too he is convicted of not possessing it; since by assaulting the step thereof,
namely faith, he knows not how one should mount up thereto. Hence then is the rash and
blind promiser of truth, who is the enemy and defender, destroyed, when the heavens, the
works of God’s fingers, are seen, that is, when the Scriptures, brought down even to the
slowness of babes, are understood; and by means of the lowness of the faith of the history,
which was transacted in time, they raise them, well nurtured and strengthened, unto the

grand height of the understanding of things eternal, up to those things which they estab-
lish.297 For these heavens, that is, these books, are the works of God’s fingers; for by the
operation of the Holy Ghost in the Saints they were completed. For they that have regarded
their own glory rather than man’s salvation, have spoken without the Holy Ghost, in whom
are the bowels of the mercy of God.
9. “For I shall see the heavens, the works of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which
Thou hast ordained.” The moon and stars are ordained in the heavens; since both the Church
universal, to signify which the moon is often put, and Churches in the several places partic-
ularly, which I imagine to be intimated by the name of stars, are established in the same
Scriptures, which we believe to be expressed by the word heavens.298 But why the moon
justly signifies the Church, will be more seasonably considered in another Psalm, where it
is said, “The sinners have bent their bow, that they may shoot in the obscure moon the upright
in heart.”299
10. “What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that Thou visitest
him?” (ver. 4). It may be asked, what distinction there is between man and son of man. For
if there were none, it would not be expressed thus, “man, or son of man,” disjunctively. For
if it were written thus, “What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, and son of man, that
Thou visitest him?” it might appear to be a repetition of the word “man.” But now when
the expression is, “man or son of-man,” a distinction is more clearly intimated. This is cer-
tainly to be remembered, that every son of man is a man; although every man cannot be
taken to be a son of man. Adam, for instance, was a man, but not a son of man. Wherefore
we may from hence consider and distinguish what is the difference in this place between
man and son of man; namely, that they who bear the image of the earthy man, who is not
a son of man, should be signified by the name of men; but that they who bear the image of
the heavenly Man,300 should be rather called sons of men; for the former again is called the
old man301 and the latter the new; but the new is born of the old, since spiritual regeneration
is begun by a change of an earthy, and worldly life;302 and therefore the latter is called son
of man. “Man” then in this place is earthy, but “son of man” heavenly; and the former is far
removed from God, but the latter present with God; and therefore is He mindful of the
former, as in far distance from Him; but the latter He visiteth, with whom being present He

Psalm VIII
enlighteneth him with His countenance. For “salvation is far from sinners;”303 and, “The
light of Thy countenance hath been stamped upon us, O Lord.”304 So in another Psalm he
saith, that men in conjunction with beasts are made whole together with these beasts, not
by any present inward illumination, but by the multiplication of the mercy of God, whereby
His goodness reacheth even to the lowest things; for the wholeness of carnal men is carnal,
as of the beasts; but separating the sons of men from those whom being men he joined with
cattle, he proclaims that they are made blessed, after a far more exalted method, by the en-
lightening of the truth itself, and by a certain inundation of the fountain of life. For he
speaketh thus: “Men and beasts Thou wilt make whole, O Lord, as Thy mercy hath been
multiplied, O God. But the sons of men shall put their trust in the covering of Thy wings.
They shall be inebriated with the richness of Thine house, and of the torrent of Thy pleasures
Thou shalt make them drink. For with Thee is the fountain of life, and in Thy light shall we
see light. Extend Thy mercy to them that know Thee.”305 Through the multiplication of
mercy then He is mindful of man, as of beasts; for that multiplied mercy reacheth even to
them that are afar off; but He visiteth the son of man, over whom, placed under the covering
of His wings, He extendeth mercy, and in His light giveth light, and maketh him drink of
His pleasures, and inebriateth him with the richness of His house, to forget the sorrows and
the wanderings of his former conversation. This son of man, that is, the new man, the re-
pentance of the old man begets with pain and tears. He, though new, is nevertheless called
yet carnal, whilst he is fed with milk; “I would not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as
unto carnal,” says the Apostle. And to show that they were already regenerate, he says, “As
unto babes in Christ, I have given you milk to drink, not meat.” And when he relapses, as
often happens, to the old life, he hears in reproof that he is a man; “Are ye not men,” he
says, “and walk as men?” 306
11. Therefore was the son of man first visited in the person of the very Lord Man, born
of the Virgin Mary. Of whom, by reason of the very weakness of the flesh, which the Wisdom
of God vouchsafed to bear, and the humiliation of the Passion, it is justly said, “Thou hast
lowered Him a little lower than the Angels” (ver. 5). But that glorifying is added, in which
He rose and ascended up into heaven; “With glory,” he says, “and with honour hast Thou
crowned Him; and hast set Him over the works of Thine hands” (ver. 6). Since even Angels
are the works of God’s hands, even over Angels we understand the Only-begotten Son to
have been set; whom we hear and believe, by the humiliation of the carnal generation and
passion, to have been lowered a little lower than the Angels.

Psalm VIII
12. “Thou hast put,” he says, “all things in subjection under His feet.” When he says,
“all things,” he excepts nothing. And that he might not be allowed to understand it otherwise,
the Apostle enjoins it to be believed thus, when he says, “He being excepted which put all
things under Him.”307 And to the Hebrews he uses this very testimony from this Psalm,
when he would have it to be understood that all things are in such sort put under our Lord
Jesus Christ, as that nothing should be excepted.308 And yet he does not seem, as it were,
to subjoin any great thing, when he says, “All sheep and oxen, yea, moreover, the beasts of
the field, birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, which walk through the paths of the sea”
(ver. 7). For, leaving the heavenly excellencies and powers, and all the hosts of Angels,
leaving even man himself, he seems to have put under Him the beasts merely; unless by
sheep and oxen we understand holy souls, either yielding the fruit of innocence, or even
working that the earth may bear fruit, that is, that earthly men may be regenerated unto
spiritual richness. By these holy souls then we ought to understand not those of men only,
but of all Angels too, if we would gather from hence that all things are put under our Lord
Jesus Christ. For there will be no creature that will not be put under Him, under whom the
pre-eminent309 spirits, that I may so speak, are put. But whence shall we prove that sheep
can be interpreted even, not of men, but of the blessed spirits of the angelical creatures on
high? May we from the Lord’s saying that He had left ninety and nine sheep in the mountains,
that is, in the higher regions, and had come down for one?310 For if we take the one lost
sheep to be the human soul in Adam, since Eve even was made out of his side,311 for the
spiritual handling and consideration of all which things this is not the time, it remains that,
by the ninety and nine left in the mountains, spirits not human, but angelical, should be
meant. For as regards the oxen, this sentence is easily despatched; since men themselves are
for no other reason called oxen, but because by preaching the Gospel of the word of God
they imitate Angels, as where it is said, “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the
corn.” 312 How much more easily then do we take the Angels themselves, the messengers
of truth, to be oxen, when Evangelists by the participation of their title are called oxen?
“Thou hast put under” therefore, he says, “all sheep and oxen,” that is, all the holy spiritual
creation; in which we include that of holy men, who are in the Church, in those wine-presses
to wit, which are intimated under the other similitude of the moon and stars.313

Psalm VIII
13. “Yea moreover,” saith he, “the beasts of the field.”314 The addition of “moreover”
is by no means idle. First, because by beasts of the plain may be understood both sheep and
oxen: so that, if goats are the beasts of rocky and mountainous regions, sheep may be well
taken to be the beasts of the field. Accordingly had it been written even thus, “all sheep and
oxen and beasts of the field;” it might be reasonably asked what beasts of the plain meant,
since even sheep and oxen could be taken as such. But the addition of “moreover” besides,
obliges us, beyond question, to recognise some difference or another. But under this word,
“moreover,” not only “beasts of the field,” but also “birds of the air, and fish of the sea, which
walk through the paths of the sea” (ver. 8), are to be taken in. What is then this distinction?
Call to mind the “wine-presses,” holding husks and wine; and the threshing-floor, containing
chaff and corn; and the nets, in which were enclosed good fish and bad; and the ark of Noah,
in which were both unclean and clean animals:315 and you will see that the Churches for a
while, now in this time, unto the last time of judgment, contain not only sheep and oxen,
that is, holy laymen and holy ministers, but “moreover beasts of the field, birds of the air,
and birds of the sea, that walk through the paths of the sea.” For the beasts of the field were
very fitly understood, as men rejoicing in the pleasure of the flesh where they mount up to
nothing high, nothing laborious. For the field is also “the broad way, that leadeth to destruc-
tion:”316 and in a field is Abel slain.317 Wherefore there is cause to fear, lest one coming
down from the mountains of God’s righteousness (“for thy righteousness,” he says, “is as
the mountains of God”318) making choice of the broad and easy paths of carnal pleasure,
be slain by the devil. See now too “the birds of heaven,” the proud, of whom it is said, “They
have set their mouth against the heaven.”319 See how they are carried on high by the wind,
“who say, We will magnify our tongue, our lips are our own, who is our Lord?”320 Behold
too the fish of the sea, that is, the curious; who walk through the paths of the sea, that is,
search in the deep after the temporal things of this world: which, like paths in the sea, vanish
and perish, as quickly as the water comes together again after it has given room, in their
passage, to ships, or to whatsoever walketh or swimmeth. For he said not merely, who walk
the paths of the sea; but “walk through,” he said; showing the very determined earnestness

Psalm VIII
of those who seek after vain and fleeting things. Now these three kinds of vice, namely, the
pleasure of the flesh, and pride, and curiosity, include all sins. And they appear to me to be
enumerated by the Apostle John, when he says, “Love not the world; for all that is in the
world is the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.”321 For through
the eyes especially prevails curiosity. To what the rest indeed belong is clear. And that
temptation of the Lord Man was threefold: by food, that is, by the lust of the flesh, where it
is suggested, “command these stones that they be made bread:”322 by vain boasting, where,
when stationed on a mountain, all the kingdoms of this earth are shown Him, and promised
if He would worship:323 by curiosity, where, from the pinnacle of the temple, He is advised
to cast Himself down, for the sake of trying whether He would be borne up by Angels.324
And accordingly after that the enemy could prevail with Him by none of these temptations,
this is said of him, “When the devil had ended all his temptation.”325 With a reference then
to the meaning of the wine-presses, not only the wine, but the husks too are put under His
feet; to wit, not only sheep and oxen, that is, the holy souls of believers, either in the laity,
or in the ministry; but moreover both beasts of pleasure, and birds of pride, and fish of
curiosity. All which classes of sinners we see mingled now in the Churches with the good
and holy. May He work then in His Churches, and separate the wine from the husks: let us
give heed, that we be wine, and sheep or oxen; not husks, or beasts of the field, or birds of
heaven, or fish of the sea, which walk through the paths of the sea. Not that these names
can be understood and explained in this way only, but the explanation of them must be ac-
cording to the place where they are found. For elsewhere they have other meanings. And
this rule must be kept to in every allegory, that what is expressed by the similitude should
be considered agreeably to the meaning of the particular place: for this is the manner of the
Lord’s and the Apostles’ teaching. Let us repeat then the last verse, which is also put at the
beginning of the Psalm, and let us praise God, saying, “O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is
Thy name in all the earth!” For fitly, after the matter of the discourse, is the return made to
the heading, whither all that discourse must be referred.

Psalm VIII
Psalm IX.
1. The inscription of this Psalm is, “To the end for the hidden things of the Son, a Psalm
of David himself.”326 As to the hidden things of the Son there may be a question: but since
he has not added whose, the very only-begotten Son of God should be understood. For
where a Psalm has been inscribed of the son of David,327 “When,” he says, “he fled from
the face of Absalom his son;” although his name even was mentioned, and therefore there
could be no obscurity as to whom it was spoken of: yet it is not merely said, from the face
of son Absalom; but “his” is added. But here both because “his” is not added, and much is
said of the Gentiles, it cannot properly be taken of Absalom.328 For the war which that
abandoned one waged with his father, no way relates to the Gentiles, since there the people
of Israel only were divided against themselves. This Psalm is then sung for the hidden things
of the only-begotten Son of God.329 For the Lord Himself too, when, without addition, He
uses the word Son, would have Himself, the Only-begotten to be understood; as where He
says, “If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.”330 For He said not, the
Son of God; but in saying merely, Son, He gives us to understand whose Son it is. Which
form of expression nothing admits of, save His excellency of whom we so speak, that, though
we name Him not, He can be understood. For so we say, it rains, clears up, thunders, and
such like expressions; and we do not add who does it all; for that the excellency of the doer
spontaneously presents itself to all men’s minds, and does not want words. What then are
the hidden things of the Son? By which expression we must first understand that there are
some things of the Son manifest, from which those are distinguished which are called hidden.
Wherefore since we believe two advents of the Lord, one past, which the Jews understood
not: the other future, which we both hope for; and since the one which the Jews understood
not, profited the Gentiles; “For the hidden things of the Son” is not unsuitably understood
to be spoken of this advent, in which “blindness in part is happened to Israel, that the fulness
of the Gentiles might come in.”331
For notice of two judgments is conveyed to us throughout the Scriptures, if any one will
give heed to them, one hidden, the other manifest. The hidden one is passing now, of which
the Apostle Peter says, “The time is come that judgment should begin from the house of the
326 [This title is only conjecturally elucidated by expositors. Here arises the confusion of numbering the
Psalms; the Septuagint and Vulgate making the following Psalm all one with this.—C.]

329 [It is the first of the alphabetical Psalms, which are: Ps. ix., x., xxv., xxxiv., cxi., cxii., cxix., cxlv. Of these,
only four are ascribed to David; viz., ix., xxv., xxxiv., and cxlv.—C.]

Lord.”332 The hidden judgment accordingly is the pain, by which now each man is either
exercised to purification, or warned to conversion, or if he despise the calling and discipline
of God, is blinded unto damnation. But the manifest judgment is that in which the Lord, at
His coming, will judge the quick and the dead, all men confessing that it is He by whom
both rewards shall be assigned to the good, and punishments to the evil. But then that con-
fession will avail, not to the remedy of evils, but to the accumulation of damnation. Of these
two judgments, the one hidden, the other manifest, the Lord seems to me to have spoken,
where He says, “Whoso believeth on Me hath passed from death unto life, and shall not
come into judgment;”333 into the manifest judgment, that is. For that which passes from
death unto life by means of some affliction, whereby “He scourgeth every son whom He
receiveth,”334 is the hidden judgment. “But whoso believeth not,” saith He, “hath been
judged already:”335 that is, by this hidden judgment hath been already prepared for that
manifest one. These two judgments we read of also in Wisdom, whence it is written,
“Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, Thou didst give a judgment
to mock them; But they that have not been corrected by this judgment have felt a judgment
worthy of God.”336 Whoso then are not corrected by this hidden judgment of God, shall
most worthily be punished by that manifest one.…
2. “I will confess unto Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart” (ver. 1). He doth not, with
a whole heart, confess unto God, who doubteth of His Providence in any particular: but he
who sees already the hidden things of the wisdom of God, how great is His invisible reward,
who saith, “We rejoice in tribulations;”337 and how all torments, which are inflicted on the
body, are either for the exercising of those that are converted to God, or for warning that
they be converted, or for just preparation of the obdurate unto their last damnation: and so
now all things are referred to the governance of Divine Providence, which fools think done
as it were by chance and at random, and without any Divine ordering. “I will tell all Thy
marvels.” He tells all God’s marvels, who sees them performed not only openly on the body,
but invisibly indeed too in the soul, but far more sublimely and excellently. For men earthly,
and led wholly by the eye, marvel more that the dead Lazarus rose again in the body, than
that Paul the persecutor rose again in soul.338 But since the visible miracle calleth the soul

to the light, but the invisible enlighteneth the soul that comes when called, he tells all God’s
marvels, who, by believing the visible, passes on to the understanding of the invisible.
3. “I will be glad and exult in Thee” (ver. 2). Not any more in this world, not in pleasure
of bodily dalliance, not in relish of palate and tongue, not in sweetness of perfumes, not in
joyousness of passing sounds, not in the variously coloured forms of figure, not in vanities
of men’s praise, not in wedlock and perishable offspring, not in superfluity of temporal
wealth, not in this world’s getting, whether it extend over place and space, or be prolonged
in time’s succession: but, “I will be glad and exult in Thee,” namely, in the hidden things of
the Son, where “the light of Thy countenance hath been stamped on us, O Lord:”339 for,
“Thou wilt hide them,” saith he, “in the hiding place of Thy countenance.”340 He then will
be glad and exult in Thee, who tells all Thy marvels. And He will tell all Thy marvels (since
it is now spoken of prophetically), “who came not to do His own will, but the will of Him
who sent Him.”341
4. For now the Person of the Lord begins to appear speaking in this Psalm. For it follows,
“I will sing to Thy Name, O Most High, in turning mine enemy behind.” His enemy then,
where was he turned back? Was it when it was said to him, “Get thee behind, Satan”?342
For then he who by tempting desired to put himself before, was turned behind, by failing
in deceiving Him who was tempted, and by availing nothing against Him. For earthly men
are behind: but the heavenly man is preferred before, although he came after. For “the first
man is of the earth, earthy: the second Man is from heaven, heavenly.”343 But from this
stock he came by whom it was said, “He who cometh after me is preferred before me.”344
And the Apostle forgets “those things that are behind, and reaches forth unto those things
that are before.”345 The enemy, therefore, was turned behind, after that he could not deceive
the heavenly Man being tempted; and he turned himself to earthy men, where he can have
dominion.…For in truth the devil is turned behind, even in the persecution of the righteous,
and he, much more to their advantage, is a persecutor, than if he went before as a leader
and a prince. We must sing then to the Name of the Most High in turning the enemy behind:
since we ought to choose rather to fly from him as a persecutor, than to follow him as a
leader. For we have whither we may fly and hide ourselves in the hidden things of the Son;
seeing that “the Lord hath been made a refuge for us.”346

5. “They will be weakened, and perish from Thy face” (ver. 3). Who will be weakened
and perish, but the unrighteous and ungodly? “They will be weakened,” while they shall
avail nothing; “and they shall perish,” because the ungodly will not be; “from the face” of
God, that is, from the knowledge of God, as he perished who said, “But now I live not, but
Christ liveth in me.”347 But why will the ungodly “be weakened and perish from thy face?”
“Because,” he saith, “Thou hast made my judgment, and my cause:” that is, the judgment
in which I seemed to be judged, Thou hast made mine; and the cause in which men con-
demned me just and innocent, Thou hast made mine. For such things served348 Him for
our deliverance: as sailors too call the wind theirs, which they take advantage of for prosper-
ous sailing.
6. “Thou satest on the throne Who judgest equity” (ver. 4). Whether the Son say this to
the Father, who said also, “Thou couldest have no power against Me, except it were given
thee from above,”349 referring this very thing, that the Judge of men was judged for men’s
advantage, to the Father’s equity and His own hidden things: or whether man say to God,
“Thou satest on the throne Who judgest equity,” giving the name of God’s throne to his
soul, so that his body may peradventure be the earth, which is called God’s “footstool:”350
for “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself:”351 or whether the soul of the
Church, perfect now and without spot and wrinkle,352 worthy, that is, of the hidden things
of the Son, in that “the King hath brought her into His chamber,”353 say to her spouse,
“Thou satest upon the throne Who judgest equity,” in that Thou hast risen from the dead,
and ascended up into heaven, and sittest at the right hand of the Father: whichsoever, I say,
of those opinions, whereunto this verse may be referred, is preferred, it transgresses not the
rule of faith.
7. “Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and the ungodly hath perished” (ver. 5). We take
this to be more suitably said to the Lord Jesus Christ, than said by Him. For who else hath
rebuked the heathen, and the ungodly perished, save He, who after that He ascended up
into heaven, sent the Holy Ghost, that, filled by Him, the Apostles should preach the word
of God with boldness, and freely reprove men’s sins? At which rebuke the ungodly perished;
because the ungodly was justified and was made godly. “Thou hast effaced their name for

Psalm IX
the world,354 and for the world’s world. The name of the ungodly hath been effaced. For
they are not called ungodly who believe in the true God. Now their name is effaced “for the
world,” that is, as long as the course of the temporal world endures. “And for the world’s
world.” What is “the world’s world,” but that whose image and shadow, as it were, this world
possesses? For the change of seasons succeeding one another, whilst the moon is on the
wane, and again on the increase, whilst the sun each year returns to his quarter, whilst spring,
or summer, or autumn, or winter passes away only to return, is in some sort an imitation
of eternity. But this world’s world is that which abides in immutable eternity. As a verse in
the mind, and a verse in the voice, the former is understood, the latter heard; and the former
fashions the latter; and hence the former works in art and abides, the latter sounds in the
air and passes away. So the fashion of this changeable world is defined by that world un-
changeable which is called the world’s world. And hence the one abides in the art, that is,
in the Wisdom and Power of God: but the other is made to pass in the governance of creation.
If after all it be not a repetition, so that after it was said “for the world,” lest it should be
understood of this world that passeth away, it were added “for the world’s world.” For in
the Greek copies it is thus, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος Which the Latins
have for the most rendered, not, “for the world, and for the world’s world;”355 but, “for ever,
and for the world’s world,”356 that in the words “for the world’s world,” the, words “for
ever,” should be explained. “The name,” then, “of the ungodly Thou hast effaced for ever,”
for from henceforth the ungodly shall never be. And if their name be not prolonged unto
this world, much less unto the world’s world.357
8. “The swords of the enemy have failed at the end” (ver. 6). Not enemies in the plural,
but this enemy in the singular. Now what enemy’s swords have failed but the devil’s? Now
these are understood to be divers erroneous opinions, whereby as with swords he destroys
souls. In overcoming these swords, and in bringing them to failure, that sword is employed,
of which it is said in the seventh Psalm, “If ye be not converted, He will brandish His
sword.”358 And peradventure this is the end, against which the swords of the enemy fail;
since up to it they are of some avail. Now it worketh secretly, but in the last judgment it will
be brandished openly. By it the cities are destroyed. For so it follows, “The swords of the
enemy have failed at the end: and Thou hast destroyed the cities.” Cities indeed wherein
the devil rules, where crafty and deceitful counsels hold, as it were, the place of a court, on
354 Or “unto the age,” sæculum. The meaning of “age,” as in our expression “world without end,” is the
primary one in Latin.

which supremacy attend as officers and ministers the services of all the members, the eyes
for curiosity, the ears for lasciviousness, or for whatsoever else is gladly listened to that bears
on evil, the hands for rapine or any other violence or pollution soever, and all the other
members after this manner serving the tyrannical supremacy, that is, perverse counsels. Of
this city the commonalty, as it were, are all soft affections and disturbing emotions of the
mind, stirring up daily seditions in a man. So then where a king, where a court, where
ministers, where commonalty are found, there is a city. Now again would such things be in
bad cities, unless they were first in individual men, who are, as it were, the elements and
seeds of cities. These cities He destroys, when on the prince being shut out thence, of whom
it was said, “The prince of this world” has been “cast out,”359 these kingdoms are wasted by
the word of truth, evil counsels are laid to sleep, vile affections tamed, the ministries of the
members and senses taken captive, and transferred to the service of righteousness and good
works: that as the Apostle says, “Sin should no more reign in” our “mortal body,”360 and
so forth. Then is the soul at peace, and the man is disposed to receive rest and blessedness.
“Their memorial has perished with uproar:” with the uproar, that is, of the ungodly. But it
is said, “with uproar,” either because when ungodliness is overturned, there is uproar made:
for none passeth to the highest place, where there is the deepest silence, but he who with
much uproar shall first have warred with his own vices: or “with uproar,” is said, that the
memory of the ungodly should perish in the perishing even of the very uproar, in which
ungodliness riots.
9. “And the Lord abideth for ever” (ver. 7). “Wherefore” then “have the heathen raged,
and the people imagined vain things against the Lord, and against His anointed:”361 for
“the Lord abideth for ever. He hath prepared His seat in judgment, and He shall judge the
world in equity.” He prepared His seat when He was judged. For by that patience Man
purchased heaven, and God in Man profited believers. And this is the Son’s hidden judgment.
But seeing He is also to come openly and in the sight of all to judge the quick and the dead,
He hath prepared His seat in the hidden judgment: and He shall also openly “judge the
world in equity:” that is, He shall distribute gifts proportioned to desert, setting the sheep
on His right hand, and the goats on His left.362 “He shall judge the people with justice”(ver.
8). This is the same as was said above, “He shall judge the world in equity.” Not as men
judge who see not the heart, by whom very often worse men are acquitted than are con-
demned: but “in equity” and “with justice” shall the Lord judge, “conscience bearing witness,
and thoughts accusing, or else excusing.”363

Psalm IX
10. “And the Lord hath become a refuge to the poor” (ver. 9). Whatsoever be the perse-
cutions of that enemy, who hath been turned behind, what harm shall he do to them whose
refuge the Lord hath become? But this will be, if in this world, in which that one has an office
of power, they shall choose to be poor, by loving nothing which either here leaves a man
while he lives and loves, or is left by him when he dies. For to such a poor man hath the
Lord become a refuge, “an Helper in due season, in tribulation.” Lo, He maketh poor, for
“He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”364 For what “an Helper in due season” is, he
explained by adding “in tribulation.” For the soul is not turned to God, save when it is turned
away from this world: nor is it more seasonably turned away from this world, except toils
and pains be mingled with its trifling and hurtful and destructive pleasures.
11. “And let them who know Thy Name, hope in Thee” (ver. 10), when they shall have
ceased hoping in wealth, and in the other enticements of this world. For the soul indeed
that seeketh where to fix her hope, when she is torn away from this world, the knowledge
of God’s Name seasonably receives. For the mere Name of God hath now been published
everywhere: but the knowledge of the name is, when He is known whose name it is. For the
name is not a name for its own sake, but for that which it signifies. Now it has been said,
“The Lord is His Name.”365 Wherefore whoso willingly submits himself to God as His ser-
vant, hath known this name. “And let them who know Thy Name hope in Thee” (ver. 10).
Again, the Lord saith to Moses, “I am That I am; and Thou shalt say to the children of Israel,
I Am, hath sent me.”366 “Let them” then “who know Thy Name, hope in Thee;” that they
may not hope in those things which flow by in time’s quick revolution, having nothing but
“will be” and “has been.” For what in them is future, when it arrives, straightway becomes
the past; it is awaited with eagerness, it is lost with pain. But in the nature of God nothing
will be, as if it were not yet; or hath been, as if it were no longer: but there is only that which
is, and this is eternity. Let them cease then to hope in and love things temporal, and let them
apply themselves to hope eternal, who know His name who said, “I am That I am;” and of
whom it was said, “I Am hath sent me.”367 “For Thou hast not forsaken them that seek
Thee, O Lord.” Whoso seek Him, seek no more things transient and perishable; “For no
man can serve two masters.”368
12. “Sing to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion” (ver. 11), is said to them, whom the Lord
forsakes not as they seek Him. He dwelleth in Sion, which is interpreted watching, and
which beareth the likeness of the Church that now is; as Jerusalem beareth the likeness of

368 Matt. vi. 24.
Psalm IX
the Church that is to come, that is, the city of Saints already enjoying life angelical; for Jeru-
salem is by interpretation the vision of peace. 369 Now watching goes before vision, as this
Church goes before that one which is promised, the city immortal and eternal. But in time
it goes before, not in dignity: because more honourable is that whither we are striving to
arrive, than what we practise, that we may attain to arrive; now we practise watching, that
we may arrive at vision. But again this same Church which now is, unless the Lord inhabit
her, the most earnest watching might run into any sort of error. And to this Church it was
said, “For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are:”370 again, “that Christ may dwell
in the inner man in your hearts by faith.”371 It is enjoined us then, that we sing to the Lord
who dwelleth in Sion, that with one accord we praise the Lord, the Inhabitant of the Church.
“Show forth His wonders among the heathen.” It has both been done, and will not cease to
be done.
13. “For requiring their blood He hath remembered” (ver. 12). As if they, who were sent
to preach the Gospel, should make answer to that injunction which has been mentioned,
“Show forth His wonders among the heathen,” and should say, “O Lord, who hath believed
our report?”372 and again, “For Thy sake we are killed all the day long;”373 the Psalmist
suitably goes on to say, That Christians not without great reward of eternity will die in per-
secution, “for requiring their blood He hath remembered.” But why did he choose to say,
“their blood”? Was it, as if one of imperfect knowledge and less faith should ask, How will
they “show them forth,” seeing that the infidelity of the heathen will rage against them; and
he should be answered, “For requiring their blood He hath remembered,” that is, the last
judgment will come, in which both the glory of the slain and the punishment of the slayers
shall be made manifest? But let no one suppose “He hath remembered” to be so used, as
though forgetfulness can attach to God; but since the judgment will be after a long interval,
it is used in accordance with the feeling of weak men, who think God hath forgotten, because
He doth not act so speedily as they wish. To such is said what follows also, “He hath not
forgotten the cry of the poor:” that is, He hath not, as you suppose, forgotten. As if they
should on hearing, “He hath remembered,” say, Then He had forgotten; No, “He hath not
forgotten,” says the Psalmist, “the cry of the poor.”
14. But I ask, what is that cry of the poor, which God forgetteth not? Is it that cry, the
words whereof are these, “Pity me, O Lord, see my humiliation at the hands of my enemies”?
(ver. 13). Why then did he not say, Pity “us” O Lord, see our humiliation at the hands of
369 See more fully on Ps. li. 18 (Lat. l. 20).

Psalm IX
“our” enemies, as if many poor were crying; but as if one, Pity “me,” O Lord? Is it because
One intercedeth for the Saints, “who” first “for our sakes became poor, though He was
rich;”374 and it is He who saith, “Who exaltest me from the gates of death (ver. 14), that I
may declare all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion”? For man is exalted in Him,
not that Man only which He beareth, which is the Head of the Church; but whichsoever
one of us also is among the other members, and is exalted from all depraved desires; which
are the gates of death, for that through them is the road to death. But the joy in the fruition
is at once death itself, when one gains what he hath in abandoned wilfulness coveted: for
“coveting is the root of all evil:”375 and therefore is the gate of death, for “the widow that
liveth in pleasures is dead.”376 At which pleasures we arrive through desires as it were
through the gates of death. But all highest purposes are the gates of the daughter of Sion,
through which we come to the vision of peace in the Holy Church.…Or haply are the gates
of death the bodily senses and eyes, which were opened when the man tasted of the forbidden
tree,377… and are the gates of the daughter of Sion the sacraments and beginnings of faith,
which are opened to them that knock, that they may arrive at the hidden things of the Son?…
15. Then follows, “I will exult for Thy salvation:” that is, with blessedness shall I be
holden by Thy salvation, which is our Lord Jesus Christ, the Power and Wisdom of God.
Therefore says the Church, which is here in affliction and is saved by hope, as long as the
hidden judgment of the Son is, in hope she says, “I will exult for Thy salvation:” for now
she is worn down either by the roar of violence around her, or by the errors of the heathen.
“The heathen are fixed in the corruption, which they made” (ver. 15). Consider ye how
punishment is reserved for the sinner, out of his own works; and how they that have wished
to persecute the Church, have been fixed in that corruption, which they thought to inflict.
For they were desiring to kill the body, whilst they themselves were dying in soul. “In that
snare which they hid, has their foot been taken.” The hidden snare is crafty devising. The
foot of the soul is well understood to be its love: which, when depraved, is called coveting
or lust; but when upright, love or charity.…And the Apostle says, “That being rooted and
grounded in love, ye may be able to take in.”378 The foot then of sinners, that is, their love,
is taken in the snare, which they hide: for when delight shall have followed on to deceitful
dealing, when God shall have delivered them over to the lust of their heart; that delight at
once binds them, that they dare not tear away their love thence and apply it to profitable
objects; for when they shall make the attempt, they will be pained in heart, as if desiring to

free their foot from a fetter: and giving way under this pain they refuse to withdraw from
pernicious delights. “In the snare” then “which they have hid,” that is, in deceitful counsel,
“their foot hath been taken,” that is, their love, which through deceit attains to that vain joy
whereby pain is purchased.
16. “The Lord is known executing judgments” (ver. 16). These are God’s judgments.
Not from that tranquillity of His blessedness, nor from the secret places of wisdom, wherein
blessed souls are received, is the sword, or fire, or wild beast, or any such thing brought
forth, whereby sinners may be tormented: but how are they tormented, and how does the
Lord do judgment? “In the works,” he says, “of his own hands hath the sinner been caught.”
17. Here is interposed, “The song of the diapsalma” (ver. 16): as it were the hidden joy,
as far as we can imagine, of the separation which is now made, not in place, but in the affec-
tions of the heart, between sinners and the righteous, as of the corn from the chaff, as yet
on the floor. And then follows, “Let the sinners be turned into hell” (ver. 17): that is, let
them be given into their own hands, when they are spared, and let them be ensnared in
deadly delight. “All the nations that forget God.” Because “when they did not think good to
retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.”379
18. “For there shall not be forgetfulness of the poor man to the end” (ver. 18); who now
seems to be in forgetfulness, when sinners are thought to flourish in this world’s happiness,
and the righteous to be in travail: but “the patience,” saith He, “of the poor shall not perish
for ever.” Wherefore there is need of patience now to bear with the evil, who are already
separated in will, till they be also separated at the last judgment.
19. “Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail” (ver. 19). The future judgment is prayed for:
but before it come, “Let the heathen,” saith he, “be judged in Thy sight:” that is, in secret;
which is called in God’s sight, with the knowledge of a few holy and righteous ones. “Place
a lawgiver over them, O Lord.” (ver. 20). He seems to me to point out Antichrist: of whom
the Apostle says, “When the man of sin shall be revealed.”380 “Let the heathen know that
they are men.” That they who will be set free by the Son of God, and belong to the Son of
Man, and be sons of men, that is, new men, may serve man, that is, the old man the sinner,
“for that they are men.”
20. And because it is believed that he is to arrive at so great a pitch of empty glory, and
he will be permitted to do so great things, both against all men and against the Saints of
God, that then some weak ones shall indeed think that God cares not for human affairs, the
Psalmist interposing a diapsalma, adds as it were the voice of men groaning and asking why
judgment is deferred.381

“Why, O Lord,” saith he, “hast Thou withdrawn afar off?” (ver. 1). Then he who thus
inquired, as if all on a sudden he understood, or as if he asked, though he knew, that he
might teach, adds, “Thou despisest in due seasons, in tribulations:” that is, Thou despisest
seasonably, and causest tribulations to inflame men’s minds with longing for Thy coming.
For that fountain of life is sweeter to them that have much thirst. Therefore he hints the
reason of the delay, saying, “Whilst the ungodly vaunteth himself, the poor man is inflamed”
(ver. 2). Wondrous it is and true with what earnestness of good hope the little ones are in-
flamed unto an upright living by comparison with sinners. In which mystery it comes to
pass, that even heresies are permitted to exist; not that heretics themselves wish this, but
because Divine Providence worketh this result from their sins, which both maketh and or-
daineth the light; but ordereth only the darkness, that by comparison therewith the light
may be more pleasant, as by comparison with heretics the discovery of truth is more sweet.
For so, by this comparison, the approved, who are known to God, are made manifest among
men.
1. “They are taken in their thoughts, which they think:” that is, their evil thoughts become
chains to them. But how become they chains? “For the sinner is praised,” saith he, “in the
desires of his soul” (ver. 3). The tongues of flatterers bind souls in sin. For there is pleasure
in doing those things, in which not only is no reprover feared, but even an approver heard.
“And he that does unrighteous deeds is blessed.” Hence “are they taken in their thoughts,
which they think.”
2. “The sinner hath angered the Lord” (ver. 4). Let no one congratulate the man that
prospers in his way, to whose sins no avenger is nigh, and an approver is by. This is the
greater anger of the Lord. For the sinner hath angered the Lord, that he should suffer these
things, that is, should not suffer the scourging of correction. “The sinner hath angered the
Lord: according to the multitude of His anger He will not search it out.” Great is His anger,
when He searcheth not out, when He as it were forgetteth and marketh not sin, and by fraud
and wickedness man attains to riches and honours: which will especially be the case in that
Antichrist, who will seem to man blessed to that degree, that he will even be thought God.383
But how great this anger of God is, we are taught by what follows.
3. “God is not in his sight, his ways are polluted in all time” (ver. 5). He that knows what
in the soul gives joy and gladness, knows how great an ill it is to be abandoned by the light
of truth: since a great ill do men reckon the blindness of their bodily eyes, whereby this light
is withdrawn. How great then the punishment he endures, who through the prosperous issue
382 The two Psalms are combined in the Vulgate. But here the verses begin again, treating this as “Ps. x.
secundum Hebræos.” [And so our English version.—C.]
383 [Compare Hippolytus, A.N.F. vol. v. pp. 205–219.—C.]
Psalm X
Psalm X
of his sins is brought to that pass, that God is not in his sight, and that his ways are polluted
in all time, that is, his thoughts and counsels are unclean! “Thy judgments are taken away
from his face.” For the mind conscious of evil, whilst it seems to itself to suffer no punish-
ment, believes that God doth not judge, and so are God’s judgments taken away from its
face; while this very thing is great condemnation. “And he shall have dominion over all his
enemies.” For so is it delivered, that he will overcome all kings, and alone obtain the kingdom;
since too according to the Apostle, who preaches concerning him, “He shall sit in the temple
of God, exalting himself above all that is worshipped and that is called God.”384
4. And seeing that being delivered over to the lust of his own heart, and predestinated
to extreme385 condemnation, he is to come, by wicked arts, to that vain and empty height
and rule; therefore it follows, “For he hath said in his heart, I shall not move from generation
to generation without evil” (ver. 6): that is, my fame and my name will not pass from this
generation to the generation of posterity, unless by evil arts I acquire so lofty a principality,
that posterity cannot be silent concerning it. For a mind abandoned and void of good arts,
and estranged from the light of righteousness, by bad arts devises a passage for itself to a
fame so lasting, as is celebrated even in posterity. And they that cannot be known for good,
desire that men should speak of them even for ill, provided that their name spread far and
wide. And this I think is here meant, “I shall not move from generation to generation without
evil.” There is too another interpretation, if a mind vain and full of error supposes that it
cannot come from the mortal generation to the generation of eternity, but by bad arts: which
indeed was also reported of Simon, when he thought that he would gain heaven by wicked
arts, and pass from the human generation to the generation divine by magic.386 Where then
is the wonder, if that man of sin too, who is to fill up all the wickedness and ungodliness,
which all false prophets have begun, and to do such “great signs; that, if it were possible, he
should deceive the very elect,”387 shall say in his heart, “I shall not move from generation
to generation without evil”?
5. “Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness and deceit” (ver. 7). For it is a great
curse to seek heaven by such abominable arts, and to get together such earnings for acquiring
the eternal seat. But of this cursing his mouth is full. For this desire shall not take effect, but
within his mouth only will avail to destroy him, who dared promise himself such things
with bitterness and deceit, that is, with anger and insidiousness, whereby he is to bring over
the multitude to his side. “Under his tongue is toil and grief.” Nothing is more toilsome
than unrighteousness and ungodliness: upon which toil follows grief; for that the toil is not
384 2 Thess. ii. 4.
385 Ultimæ.
386 Acts viii. 9.
387 Matt. xxiv. 24.
Psalm X
only without fruit, but even unto destruction. Which toil and grief refer to that which he
hath said in his heart, “I shall not be moved from generation to generation without evil.”
And therefore, “under his tongue,” not on his tongue, because he will devise these things
in silence, and to men will speak other things, that he may appear good and just, and a son
of God.
6. “He lieth in ambush with the rich” (ver. 8). What rich, but those whom he will load
with this world’s gifts? And he is therefore said to lie in ambush with them, because he will
display their false happiness to deceive men; who, when with a perverted will they desire to
be such as they, and seek not the good things eternal, will fall into his snares. “That in the
dark he may kill the innocent.” “In the dark,” 388 I suppose, is said, where it is not easily
understood what should be sought, or what avoided. Now to kill the innocent, is of an inno-
cent to make one guilty.
7. “His eyes look against the poor,” for he is chiefly to persecute the righteous, of whom
it is said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven”389 (ver. 9). “He
lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in his den.” By a lion in a den, he means one in whom
both violence and deceit will work. For the first persecution of the Church was violent, when
by proscriptions, by torments, by murders, the Christians were compelled to sacrifice: an-
other persecution is crafty, which is now conducted by heretics of any kind and false brethren:
there remains a third, which is to come by Antichrist, than which there is nothing more
perilous; for it will be at once violent and crafty. Violence he will exert in empire, craft in
miracles. To the violence, the word “lion” refers; to craft, the words “in his den.” And these
are again repeated with a change of order. “He lieth in wait,” he says, “that he may catch the
poor;” this hath reference to craft: but what follows, “To catch the poor whilst he draweth
him,” is put to the score of violence. For “draweth” means, he bringeth him to himself by
violence, by whatever tortures he can.
8. Again, the two which follow are the same. “In his snare he will humble him,” is craft
(ver. 10). “He shall decline and fall, whilst he shall have domination over the poor,” is viol-
ence. For a “snare” naturally points to “lying in wait:” but domination most openly conveys
the idea of terror. And well does he say, “He will humble him in his snare.” For when he
shall begin to do those signs, the more wonderful they shall appear to men, the more those
Saints that shall be then will be despised, and, as it were, set at nought: he, whom they shall
resist by righteousness and innocence, shall seem to overcome by the marvels that he does.
But “he shall decline and fall, whilst he shall have domination over the poor;” that is, whilst
he shall inflict whatsoever punishments he will upon the servants of God that resist him.
388 In occultis.
389 Matt. v. 3.
Psalm X
9. But how shall he decline, and fall? “For he hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten;
He turneth away His face, that He see not unto the end” (ver. 11). This is declining, and the
most wretched fall, while the mind of a man prospers as it were in its iniquities, and thinks
that it is spared; when it is being blinded, and kept for an extreme and timely vengeance: of
which the Psalmist now speaks: “Arise, O Lord God, let Thine hand be exalted” (ver. 12):
that is, let Thy power be made manifest. Now he had said above, “Arise, O Lord, let not man
prevail, let the heathen be judged in Thy sight:”390 that is, in secret, where God alone seeth.
This comes to pass when the ungodly have arrived at what seems great happiness to men:
over whom is placed a lawgiver, such as they had deserved to have, of whom it is said, “Place
a lawgiver over them, O Lord, let the heathen know that they are men.”391 But now after
that hidden punishment and vengeance it is said, “Arise, O Lord God, let Thine hand be
exalted;” not of course in secret, but now in glory most manifest. “That Thou forget not the
poor unto the end;” that is, as the ungodly think, who say, “God hath forgotten, He turneth
away His face, that He should not see unto the end.” Now they deny that God seeth unto
the end, who say that He careth not for things human and earthly, for the earth is as it were
the end of things; in that it is the last element, in which men labour in most orderly sort,
but they cannot see the order of their labours, which specially belongs to the hidden things
of the Son. The Church then labouring in such times, like a ship in great waves and tempests,
awaketh the Lord as if He were sleeping, that He should command the winds, and calm
should be restored.392 He says therefore, “Arise, O Lord God, let Thine hand be exalted,
that Thou forget not the poor unto the end.”
10. Accordingly understanding now the manifest judgment, and in exultation at it, they
say, “Wherefore hath the ungodly angered God?” (ver. 13); that is, what hath it profited him
to do so great evil? “For he said in his heart, He will not require it.” Then follows, “For Thou
seest toil and considerest anger, to deliver them into Thine hands” (ver. 14). This sentence
looks for distinct explanation, wherein if there shall be error it becomes obscure. For thus
has the ungodly said in his heart, God will not require it, as though God regarded toil and
anger, to deliver them into His hands; that is, as though He feared toil and anger, and for
this reason would spare them, lest their punishment be too burdensome to Him, or lest He
should be disturbed by the storm of anger: as men generally act, excusing themselves of
vengeance, to avoid toil or anger.
11. “The poor hath been left unto Thee.” For therefore is he poor, that is, hath despised
all the temporal goods of this world, that Thou only mayest be his hope. “Thou wilt be a
helper to the orphan,” that is, to him to whom his father this world, by whom he was born
390 Ps. ix. 19.
391 Ps. ix. 20.
392 Matt. viii. 24–26.
Psalm X
after the flesh, dies, and who can already say, “The world hath been crucified unto me, and
I unto the world.”393 For of such orphans God becomes the Father. The Lord teaches us in
truth that His disciples do become orphans, to whom He saith, “Call no man father on
earth.”394 Of which He first Himself gave an example in saying, “Who is my mother, and
who my brethren?”395 Whence some most mischievous heretics396 would assert that He
had no mother; and they do not see that it follows from this, if they pay attention to these
words, that neither had His disciples fathers. For as He said, “Who is my mother?” so He
taught them, when He said, “Call no man your father on earth.”
12. “Break the arm of the sinner and of the malicious” (ver. 15); of him, namely, of
whom it was said above, “He shall have dominion over all his enemies.” He called his power
then, his arm; to which Christ’s power is opposed, of which it is said, “Arise, O Lord God,
let Thine hand be exalted. His fault shall be required, and he shall not be found because of
it;”397 that is he shall be judged for his sins, and himself shall perish because of his sin. After
this, what wonder if there follow, “The Lord shall reign for ever and world without end; ye
heathen shall perish out of His earth”? (ver. 16). He uses heathen for sinners and ungodly.
13. “The Lord hath heard the longing of the poor” (ver. 17): that longing wherewith
they were burning, when in the straits and tribulations of this world they desired the day of
the Lord. “Thine ear hath heard the preparation of their heart.” This is the preparation of
the heart, of which it is sung in another Psalm, “My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is
prepared:”398 of which the Apostle says, “But if we hope for what we see not, we do with
patience wait for it.”399 Now, by the ear of God, we ought, according to a general rule of
interpretation, to understand not a bodily member, but the power whereby He heareth; and
so (not to repeat this often) by whatever members of His are mentioned, which in us are
visible and bodily, must be understood powers of operation. For we must not suppose it
anything bodily, in that400 the Lord God hears not the sound of the voice, but the preparation
of the heart.
14. “To judge for the orphan and the humble” (ver. 18): that is, not for him who is
conformed to this world, nor for the proud. For it is one thing to judge the orphan, another

to judge for the orphan. He judges the orphan even, who condemns him; but he judges for
the orphan, who delivers sentence for him. “That man add not further to magnify himself
upon earth.” For they are men, of whom it was said, “Place a lawgiver over them, O Lord:
let the heathen know that they are men.”401 But he too, who in this same passage is under-
stood to be placed over them, will be man, of whom it is now said, “That man add not further
to magnify himself upon earth:” namely, when the Son of Man shall come to judge for the
orphan, who hath put off from himself the old man, and thus, as it were, buried his father.
15. After the hidden things then of the Son, of which, in this Psalm, many things have
been said, will come the manifest things of the Son, of which a little has been now said at
the end of the same Psalm. But the title is given from the former, which here occupy the
larger portion. Indeed, the very day of the Lord’s advent may be rightly numbered among
the hidden things of the Son, although the very presence of the Lord itself will be manifest.
For of that day it is said, that no man knoweth it, neither angels, nor powers, nor the Son
of man.402 What then so hidden, as that which is said to be hidden even to the Judge Himself,
not as regards knowledge, but disclosure? But concerning the hidden things of the Son, even
if any one would not wish to understand the Son of God, but of David himself, to whose
name the whole Psalter is attributed, for the Psalms we know are called the Psalms of David,
let him give ear to those words in which it is said to the Lord, “Have mercy on us, O Son of
David:” 403 and so even in this manner let him understand the same Lord Christ, concerning
whose hidden things is the inscription of this Psalm. For so likewise is it said by the Angel:
“God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David.”404 Nor to this understanding of
it is the sentence opposed in which the same Lord asks of the Jews, “If Christ be the Son of
David, how then doth he in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit
Thou on my right hand, until I put Thine enemies under Thy feet.”405 For it was said to the
unskilled, who although they looked for Christ’s coming, yet expected Him as man, not as
the Power and Wisdom of God. He teacheth then, in that place, the most true and pure
faith, that He is both the Lord of king David, in that He is the Word in the beginning, God
with God,406 by which all things were made; and Son, in that He was made to him of the
seed of David according to the flesh. For He doth not say, Christ is not David’s Son, but if
ye already hold that He is his Son, learn how He is his Lord: and do not hold in respect of

Psalm XI.409
To the end, a psalm of David himself.410
1. This title does not require a fresh consideration: for the meaning of, “to the end,” has
already been sufficiently handled.411 Let us then look to the text itself of the Psalm, which
to me appears to be sung against the heretics,412 who, by rehearsing and exaggerating the
sins of many in the Church, as if either all or the majority among themselves were righteous,
strive to turn and snatch us away from the breasts of the one True Mother Church: affirming
that Christ is with them, and warning us as if with piety and earnestness, that by passing
over to them we may go over to Christ, whom they falsely declare they have. Now it is known
that in prophecy Christ, among the many names in which notice of Him is conveyed in al-
legory, is also called a mountain.413 We must accordingly answer these people, and say, “I
trust in the Lord: how say ye to my soul, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?” (ver.
1). I keep to one mountain wherein I trust, how say ye that I should pass over to you, as if
there were many Christs? Or if through pride you say that you are mountains, I had indeed
need to be a sparrow winged with the powers and commandments of God: but these very
things hinder my flying to these mountains, and placing my trust in proud men. I have a
house where I may rest, in that I trust in the Lord. For even “the sparrow hath found her a
house,” 414 and, “The Lord hath become a refuge to the poor.”415 Let us say then with all
confidence, lest while we seek Christ among heretics we lose Him, “In the Lord I trust: how
say ye to my soul, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?”
2. “For, lo, sinners have bent the bow, they have prepared their arrows in the quiver,
that they may in the obscure moon shoot at the upright in heart” (ver. 2). These be the terrors
of those who threaten us as touching sinners, that we may pass over to them as the righteous.
“Lo,” they say, “the sinners have bent the bow:” the Scriptures, I suppose, by carnal inter-
pretation of which they emit envenomed sentences from them. “They have prepared their
arrows in the quiver:” the same words, that is, which they will shoot out on the authority of
Scripture, they have prepared in the secret place of the heart. “That they may in the obscure
moon416 shoot at the upright in heart:” that when they see, from the Church’s light being

obscured by the multitude of the unlearned and the carnal, that they cannot be convicted,
they may corrupt good manners by evil communications.417 But against all these terrors
we must say, “In the Lord I trust.”
3. Now I remember that I promised to consider in this Psalm with what suitableness
the moon signifies the Church.418 There are two probable opinions concerning the moon:
but of these which is the true, I suppose it either impossible or very difficult for a man to
decide. For when we ask whence the moon has her light, some say that it is her own, but
that of her globe half is bright, and half dark: and when she revolves in her own orbit, that
part wherein she is bright gradually turns towards the earth, so as that it may be seen by us;
and that therefore at first her appearance is as if she were horned.…According to this
opinion the moon in allegory signifies the Church, because in its spiritual part the Church
is bright, but in its carnal part is dark: and sometimes the spiritual part is seen by good
works, but sometimes it lies hid in the conscience, and is known to God alone, since in the
body alone is it seen by men.…But according to the other opinion also the moon is under-
stood to be the Church, because she has no light of her own, but is lighted by the only-be-
gotten Son of God, who in many places of holy Scripture is allegorically called the Sun.419
Whom certain heretics420 being ignorant of, and not able to discern Him, endeavour to
turn away the minds of the simple to this corporeal and visible sun, which is the common
light of the flesh of men and flies, and some they do pervert, who as long as they cannot
behold with the mind the inner light of truth, will not be content with the simple Catholic
faith; which is the only safety to babes, and by which milk alone they can arrive in assured
strength at the firm support of more solid food. Whichever then of these two opinions be
the true, the moon in allegory is fitly understood as the Church. Or if in such difficulties as
these, troublesome rather than edifying, there be either no satisfaction or no leisure to exercise
the mind, or if the mind itself be not capable of it, it is sufficient to regard the moon with
ordinary421 eyes, and not to seek out obscure causes, but with all men to perceive her in-
creasings and fulnesses and wanings; and if she wanes to the end that she may be renewed,
even to this rude multitude she sets forth the image of the Church, in which the resurrection
of the dead is believed.

Psalm XI
4. Next we must enquire, what in this Psalm is meant by “the obscure moon,” in which
sinners have prepared to shoot at the upright in heart? For not in one way only may the
moon be said to be obscure: for when her monthly course is finished, and when her brightness
is interrupted by a cloud, and when she is eclipsed at the full, the moon may be called obscure.
It may then be understood first of the persecutors of the Martyrs, for that they wished in
the obscure moon to shoot at the upright in heart; whether it be yet in the time of the
Church’s youth, because she had not yet shone forth in greatness on the earth, and conquered
the darkness of heathen superstitions; or by the tongues of blasphemers and such as defame
the Christian name, when the earth was as it were beclouded, the moon, that is, the Church,
could not be clearly seen; or when by the slaughter of the Martyrs themselves and so great
effusion of blood, as by that eclipse and obscuration, wherein the moon seems to exhibit a
bloody face, the weak were deterred from the Christian name; in which terror sinners shot
out words crafty and sacrilegious to pervert even the upright in heart. And secondly, it can
be understood of these sinners, whom the Church contains, because at that time, taking the
opportunity of this moon’s obscurity, they committed many crimes, which are now tauntingly
objected to us by the heretics, whereas their founders are said to have been guilty of them.422
But howsoever that be which was done in the obscure moon, now that the Catholic name
is spread and celebrated throughout the whole world, what concern of mine is it to be dis-
turbed by things unknown? For “in the Lord I trust;” nor do I listen to them that say to my
soul, “Remove into the mountains as a sparrow. For, lo, sinners have bent the bow, that they
may in the obscure moon shoot at the upright in heart.” Or if the moon seem even 423 now
obscure to them, because they would make it uncertain which is the Catholic Church, and
they strive to convict her by the sins of those many carnal men whom she contains; what
concern is this to him, who says in truth, “In the Lord I trust”? By which word every one
shows that he is himself wheat, and endures the chaff with patience unto the time of win-
nowing.
5. “In the Lord,” therefore, “I trust.” Let them fear who trust in man, and cannot deny
that they are of man’s party, by whose grey hairs they swear; and when in conversation it is
demanded of them, of what communion they are, unless they say that they are of his party,
they cannot be recognised.…Or perhaps you will say that it is written, “Ye shall know them
by their works”?424 I see indeed marvellous works the daily violences of the Circumcel-
422 He alludes to the charge of having surrendered the Holy Scriptures, alleged by the Donatists as the ground
of their separation. See Ep. 76, § 2, and 105, § 2. “We would prove to you,” he says, “that those were rather the
betrayers who condemned Cæcilianus (Bishop of Carthage) and his companions on a false charge of betrayal;”
referring to the municipal records.—Ben.

liones,425 with the bishops and presbyters for their leaders, flying about in every direction,
and calling their terrible clubs “Israels;” which men now living daily see and feel. But for
the times of Macarius,426 respecting which they raise an invidious cry,427 most men have
not seen them, and no one sees them now: and any Catholic who saw them could say, if he
wished to be a servant of God, “In the Lord I trust.”…
6. Let the Catholic soul then say, “In the Lord I trust; how say ye to my soul, Remove
into the mountains as a sparrow? For, lo, the sinners have bent the bow, they have prepared
their arrows in the quiver, that they may in the obscure moon shoot at the upright in heart:”
and from them let her turn her speech to the Lord and say, “For they have destroyed what
Thou hast perfected”428 (ver. 3). And this let her say not against these only, but against all
heretics. For they have all, as far as in them lies, destroyed the praise which God hath per-
fected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings,429 when they disturb the little ones with
vain and scrupulous questions, and suffer them not to be nourished with the milk of faith.
As if then it were said to this soul, why do they say to you, “Remove into the mountains as
a sparrow;” why do they frighten you with sinners, who “have bent the bow, to shoot in the
obscure moon at the upright in heart”? She answers, Therefore it is they frighten me, “because
they have destroyed what Thou hast perfected.” Where but in their conventicles, where they
nourish not with milk, but kill with poison the babes and ignorant of the interior light. “But
what hath the Just done?”430 If Macarius, if Cæcilianus, offend you, what hath Christ done
to you, who said, “My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave with you;”431 which ye with
your abominable dissensions have violated? What hath Christ done to you? who with such
exceeding patience endured His betrayer, as to give to him, as to the other Apostles, the first
Eucharist consecrated432 with His own hands, and blessed with His own mouth.433 What
hath Christ done to you? who sent this same betrayer, whom He called a devil,434 who before
betraying the Lord could not show good faith even to the Lord’s purse,435 with the other

come to those that with faith receive them, though he, through whom they receive them,
be such as Judas was.
7. “The Lord is in His holy temple” (ver. 4), yea in such wise as the Apostle saith, “For
the temple of God is holy, which” temple “ye are.”437 “Now if any man shall violate the
temple of God, him shall God destroy.” He violateth the temple of God, who violateth unity:
for he “holdeth not the head, from which the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
by that which every joint supplieth438 according to the working after the measure of every
part maketh increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.”439 The Lord is in this His
holy temple; which consisteth of His many members, fulfilling each his own separate duties,
by love built up into one building. Which temple he violateth, who for the sake of his own
pre-eminence separateth himself from the Catholic society. “The Lord is in His holy temple;
the Lord, His seat is in heaven.” If you take heaven to be the just man, as you take the earth
to be the sinner, to whom it was said, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou go;”440 the
words, “The Lord is in His holy temple” you will understand to be repeated, whilst it is said,
“The Lord, His seat is in heaven.”
8. “His eyes look upon the poor.”441 His to Whom the poor man hath been left, and
Who hath been made a refuge to the poor.442 And therefore all the seditions and tumults
within these nets,443 until they be drawn to shore, concerning which heretics upbraid us to
their own ruin and our correction, are caused by those men, who will not be Christ’s poor.
But do they turn away God’s eyes from such as would be so? “For His eyes look upon the
poor.” Is it to be feared lest, in the crowd of the rich, He may not be able to see the few poor,
whom He brings up in safe keeping in the bosom of the Catholic Church? “His eyelids
question the sons of men.” Here by that rule I would wish to take “the sons of men”444 of
those that from old men have been regenerated by faith. For these, by certain obscure passages
of Scripture, as it were the closed eyes of God, are exercised that they may seek: and again,
by certain clear passages, as it were the open eyes of God, are enlightened that they may re-

joice. And this frequent closing and opening in the holy Books are as it were the eyelids of
God; which question, that is, which try the “sons of men;” who are neither wearied with the
obscurity of the matter, but exercised; nor puffed up by knowledge, but confirmed.
9. “The Lord questioneth the righteous and ungodly” (ver. 5). Why then do we fear lest
the ungodly should be any hurt to us, if so be they do with insincere heart share the sacra-
ments with us, seeing that He “questioneth the righteous and the ungodly.” “But whoso
loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul:” that is, not him who believeth God, and putteth not
his hope in man, but only his own soul doth the lover of iniquity hurt.
10. “He shall rain snares upon the sinners” (ver. 6). If by clouds are understood prophets
generally, whether good or bad, who are also called false prophets: false prophets are so
ordered by the Lord God, that by them He may rain snares upon sinners.445 For no one,
but the sinner, falls into a following of them, whether by way of preparation for the last
punishment, if he shall choose to persevere in sin; or to dissuade from pride, if in time he
shall come to seek God with a more sincere intent. But if by clouds are understood good
and true prophets only; by these too it is clear that God raineth snares upon sinners, although
by them He watereth also the godly unto fruitfulness. “To some,” saith the Apostle, “we are
the savour of life unto life; to some the savour of death unto death.”446 For not prophets
only, but all who with the word of God water souls, may be called clouds. Who when they
are understood amiss, God raineth snares upon sinners; but when they are understood
aright, He maketh the hearts of the godly and believing fruitful. As, for instance, the passage,
“and they two shall be in one flesh,”447 if one interpret it with an eye to lust, He raineth a
snare upon the sinner. But if you understand it, as he who says, “But I speak concerning
Christ and the Church,”448 He raineth a shower on the fertile soil. Now both are effected
by the same cloud, that is, holy Scripture. Again the Lord says, “Not that which goeth into
your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out.”449 The sinner hears this, and makes
ready his palate for gluttony: the righteous hears it, and is guarded against the superstitious
distinction in meats. Here then also out of the same cloud of Scripture, according to the
several desert of each, upon the sinner the rain of snares, upon the righteous the rain of
fruitfulness, is poured.
11. “Fire and brimstone and the blast of the tempest is the portion of their cup.” This
is their punishment and end, by whom the name of God is blasphemed; that first they should
be wasted by the fire of their own lusts, then by the ill savour of their evil deeds cast off from

the company of the blessed, at last carried away and overwhelmed suffer penalties unspeak-
able. For this is the portion of their cup: as of the righteous, “Thy cup inebriating how excel-
lent is it! for they shall be inebriated with the richness of Thine house.”450 Now I suppose
a cup is mentioned for this reason, that we should not suppose that anything is done by
God’s providence, even in the very punishments of sinners, beyond moderation and measure.
And therefore as if he were giving a reason why this should be, he added, “For the Lord is
righteous, and hath loved righteousnesses” (ver. 7). The plural not without meaning, but
only because he speaks of men, is as that righteousnesses be understood to be used for
righteous men. For in many righteous men there seem, so to say, to be righteousnesses,
whereas there is one only righteousness of God whereof they all participate. Like as when
one face looks upon many mirrors, what in it is one only, is by those many mirrors reflected
manifoldly. Wherefore he recurs to the singular, saying, “His face hath seen equity.” Perhaps,
“His face hath seen equity,” is as if it were said, Equity hath been seen in His face, that is, in
knowledge of Him. For God’s face is the power by which He is made known to them that
are worthy. Or at least, “His face hath seen equity,” because He doth not allow Himself to
be known by the evil, but by the good; and this is equity.
12. But if any one would understand the moon of the synagogue, let him refer the Psalm
to the Lord’s passion, and of the Jews say, “For they have destroyed what Thou hast perfec-
ted;”451 and of the Lord Himself, “But what hath the Just done?” whom they accused as the
destroyer of the Law: whose precepts, by their corrupt living, and by despising them, and
by setting up their own, they had destroyed, so that the Lord Himself may speak as Man, as
He is wont, saying, “In the Lord I trust; how say ye to my soul, Remove into the mountains
as a sparrow?”452 by reason, that is, of the fear of those who desire to apprehend and crucify
Him. Since the interpretation is not unreasonable of sinners wishing to “shoot at the upright
in heart,”453 that is, those who believed in Christ, “in the obscure moon,” that is, the Syn-
agogue filled with sinners. To this too the words, “The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord,
His seat is in heaven,”454 are suitable; that is, the Word in Man, or the very Son of Man who
is in heaven.455 “His eyes look upon the poor;” either on to Him whom He assumed as God,
or for whom He suffered as Man. “His eyelids question the sons of men.” The closing and
opening of the eyes, which is probably meant by the word eyelids, we may take to be His
death and resurrection, whereby He tried the sons of men His disciples, terrified at His

passion, and gladdened by the resurrection. “The Lord questioneth the righteous and un-
godly,”456 even now from out of Heaven governing the Church. “But whoso loveth iniquity,
hateth his own soul.” Why it is so, what follows teaches us. For “He shall rain snares upon
the sinners:”457 which is to be taken according to the exposition above given, and so on with
all the rest to the end of the Psalm.

Psalm XII.458
To the end, for the eighth, a psalm of David.
1. It has been said on the sixth Psalm,459 that “the eighth” may be taken as the day of
judgment. “For the eighth” may also be taken “for the eternal age;” for that after the time
present, which is a cycle of seven days, it shall be given to the Saints.
2. “Save me, O Lord, for the holy hath failed;” that is, is not found: as we speak when
we say, Corn fails, or, Money fails. “For the truths have been minished from among the sons
of men” (ver. 1). The truth is one, whereby holy souls are enlightened: but forasmuch as
there are many souls, there may be said in them to be many truths: as in mirrors there are
seen many reflections from one face.
3. “He hath talked vanity each man to his neighbour” (ver. 2). By neighbour we must
understand every man: for that there is no one with whom we should work evil; “and the
love of our neighbour worketh no evil.”460 “Deceitful lips, with a heart and a heart they have
spoken evil things.”461 The repetition, “with a heart and a heart,” signifies a double heart.
4. “May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips” (ver. 3). He says “all,” that no one may suppose
himself excepted: as the Apostle says, “Upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew
first, and of the Greek.”462 “The tongue speaking great things:” the proud tongue.
5. “Who have said, We will magnify our tongue, our lips are our own, who is Lord over
us?” (ver. 4). Proud hypocrites are meant, putting confidence in their speech to deceive men,
and not submitting themselves to God.
6. “Because of the wretchedness of the needy and the sighing of the poor, now I will
arise, saith the Lord”463 (ver. 5). For so the Lord Himself in the Gospel pitied His people,
because they had no ruler, when they could well obey. Whence too it is said in the Gospel,
“The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few.”464 But this must be taken as spoken
in the person of God the Father, who, because of the needy and the poor, that is, who in
need and poverty were lacking spiritual good things, vouchsafed to send His own Son. From
thence begins His sermon on the mount to Matthew, where He says, “Blessed are the poor
in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”465 “I will place in salvation.” He does not say

what He would place: but, “in salvation,” must be understood as, in Christ; according to
that, “For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.”466 And hence He is understood to have placed
in Him what appertains to the taking away the wretchedness of the needy, and the comforting
the sighing of the poor. “I will deal confidently in Him:” according to that in the Gospel,
“For He taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.”467
7. “The words of the Lord” are “pure words” (ver. 6). This is in the person of the
Prophet himself, “The words of the Lord” are “pure words.” He says “pure,” without the
alloy of pretence. For many preach the truth impurely;468 for they sell it for the bribe of the
advantages of this life. Of such the Apostle says, that they declared Christ not purely. “Silver
tried by the fire for the earth.”469 These words of the Lord by means of tribulations approved
to sinners. “Purified seven times:” by the fear of God, by godliness, by knowledge, by might,
by counsel, by understanding, by wisdom.470 For seven steps also of beatitude there are,
which the Lord goes over, according to Matthew, in the same sermon which He spake on
the Mount, “Blessed” are “the poor in spirit, blessed the meek, blessed they that mourn,
blessed they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, blessed the merciful, blessed
the pure in heart, blessed the peacemakers.”471 Of which seven sentences, it may be observed
how all that long sermon was spoken. For the eighth where it is said, “Blessed” are “they
which suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake,”472 denotes the fire itself, whereby the
silver is proved seven times. And at the termination of this sermon it is said, “For He taught
them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.”473 Which refers to that which is
said in this Psalm, “I deal confidently in Him.”
8. “Thou, O Lord, shalt preserve us, and keep us from this generation to eternity” (ver.
7): here as needy and poor, there as wealthy and rich.
9. “The ungodly walk in a circle round about” (ver. 8): that is, in the desire of things
temporal, which revolves as a wheel in a repeated circle of seven days; and therefore they
do not arrive at the eighth, that is, at eternity, for which this Psalm is entitled.474 So too it
is said by Solomon, “For the wise king is the winnower of the ungodly, and he bringeth on

them the wheel of the wicked.—After Thine height Thou hast multiplied the sons of men.”475
For there is in temporal things too a multiplication, which turns away from the unity of
God. Hence “the corruptible body weigheth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle presseth
down the mind that museth upon many things.”476 But the righteous are multiplied “after
the height of God,” when “they shall go from strength to strength.”477

Psalm XII.478
Unto the end, a psalm of David.
1. “For Christ is the end of the law to every one that believeth.”479 “How long, O Lord,
wilt Thou forget me unto the end?” (ver. 1) that is, put me off as to spiritually understanding
Christ, who is the Wisdom of God, and the true end of all the aim of the soul. “How long
dost Thou turn away Thy face from me?” As God doth not forget, so neither doth He turn
His face away: but Scripture speaks after our manner. Now God is said to turn away His
face, when He doth not give to the soul, which as yet hath not the pure eye of the mind, the
knowledge of Himself.
2. “How long shall I place counsel in my soul?” (ver. 2). There is no need of counsel but
in adversity. Therefore “How long shall I place counsel in my soul?” is as if it were said,
How long shall I be in adversity? Or at least it is an answer, so that the meaning is this, So
long, O Lord, wilt Thou forget me to the end, and so long turn away Thy face from me,
until I shall place counsel in mine own soul: so that except a man place counsel in his own
soul to work mercy perfectly, God will not direct him to the end, nor give him that full
knowledge of Himself, which is “face to face.” “Sorrow in my heart through the day?” How
long shall I have, is understood. And “through the day” signifies continuance, so that day
is taken for time: from which as each one longs to be free, he has sorrow in his heart, making
entreaty to rise to things eternal, and not endure man’s day.
3. “How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?” either the devil, or carnal habit.
4. “Look on me, and hear me, O Lord my God” (ver. 3). “Look on me,” refers to what
was said, “How long” dost “Thou turn away Thy face from me.” “Hear,” refers to what was
said, “How long wilt Thou forget me to the end? Lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death.”
The eyes of the heart must be understood, that they be not closed by the pleasurable eclipse
of sin.
5. “Lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him” (ver. 4). The devil’s
mockery is to be feared. “They that trouble me will exult, if I be moved;” the devil and his
angels; who exulted not over that righteous man, Job, when they troubled him; because he
was not moved, that is, did not draw back from the stedfastness of his faith.480
6. “But I have hoped in Thy mercy” (ver. 5). Because this very thing, that a man be not
moved, and that he abide fixed in the Lord, he should not attribute to self: lest when he
glories that he hath not been moved, he be moved by this very pride. “My heart shall exult
in Thy salvation;” in Christ, in the Wisdom of God. “I will sing481 to the Lord who hath

given me good things;” spiritual good things, not belonging to man’s day. “And I will chant482
to the name of the Lord most high” (ver. 6); that is, I give thanks with joy, and in most due
order employ my body, which is the song of the spiritual soul. But if any distinction is to be
marked here, “I will sing” with the heart, “I will chant” with my works; “to the Lord,” that
which He alone seeth, but “to the name of the Lord,” that which is known among men,
which is serviceable not for Him, but for us.
482 Psallam.
Psalm XIII
Psalm XIV.483
To the end, a psalm of David himself.
1. What “to the end” means, must not be too often repeated. “For Christ is the end of
the law for righteousness to every one that believeth;”484 as the Apostle saith. We believe
on Him, when we begin to enter on the good road: we shall see Him, when we shall get to
the end. And therefore is He the end.
2. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God” (ver. 1). For not even have certain
sacrilegious and abominable philosophers, who entertain perverse and false notions of God,
dared to say, “There is no God.” Therefore it is, hath said “in his heart;” for that no one
dares to say it, even if he has dared to think it. “They are corrupt, and become abominable
in their affections:” that is, whilst they love this world and love not God; these are the affec-
tions which corrupt the soul, and so blind it, that the fool can even say, “in his heart, There
is no God. For as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over
to a reprobate mind.”485 “There is none that doeth goodness, no not up to one.” “Up to
one,” can be understood either with that one, so that no man be understood: or besides one,
that the Lord Christ may be excepted. As we say, This field is up to the sea; we do not of
course reckon the sea together with the field. And this is the better interpretation, so that
none be understood to have done goodness up to Christ; for that no man can do goodness,
except He shall have shown it. And that is true; for until a man know the one God, he cannot
do goodness.
3. “The Lord from heaven looked out upon the sons of men, to see if there be one un-
derstanding, or seeking after God” (ver. 2). It may be interpreted, upon the Jews; as he may
have given them the more honourable name of the sons of men, by reason of their worship
of the One God, in comparison with the Gentiles; of whom I suppose it was said above, “The
fool hath said in his heart, There is no God,” etc. Now the Lord looks out, that He may see,
by His holy souls: which is the meaning of, “from heaven.” For by Himself nothing is hid
from Him.
4. “All have gone out of the way, they have together become useless:” that is, the Jews
have become as the Gentiles, who were spoken of above. “There is none that doeth good,
no not up to one” (ver. 3), must be interpreted as above. “Their throat is an open sep-
ulchre.”486 Either the voracity of the ever open palate is signified: or allegorically those who

Vulgate. They are in the Septuagint, from which St. Paul quotes them (Rom. iii. 13–18); but St. Jerome omits
them, as not in the Hebrew of his day. They are, nevertheless, to be found in other parts of the original, and the

slay, and as it were devour those they have slain, into whom they instil the disorder of their
own conversation. Like to which with the contrary meaning is that which was said to Peter,
“Kill and eat;”487 that he should convert the Gentiles to his own faith and good conversation.
“With their tongues they have dealt craftily.” Flattery is the companion of the greedy and
of all bad men. “The poison of asps is under their lips.” By “poison,” he means deceit; and
“of asps,” because they will not hear the precepts of the law, as asps “will not hear the voice
of the charmer;”488 which is said more clearly in another Psalm. “Whose mouth is full of
cursing and bitterness:” this is, “the poison of asps.” “Their feet are swift to shed blood.” He
here shows forth the habit of ill doing. “Destruction and unhappiness” are “in their ways.”
For all the ways of evil men are full of toil and misery. Hence the Lord cries out, “Come
unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Take My yoke upon
you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. For My yoke is easy and My burden
light.”489 “And the way of peace have they not known:” that way, namely, which the Lord,
as I said, mentions, in the easy yoke and light burden. “There is no fear of God before their
eyes.” These do not say, “There is no God;” but yet they do not fear God.
5. “Shall not all, who work iniquity, know?” (ver. 4). He threatens the judgment. “Who
devour My people as the food of bread:” that is, daily. For the food of bread is daily food.
Now they devour the people, who serve their own ends out of them, not referring their
ministry to the glory of God, and the salvation of those over whom they are.
6. “They have not called upon the Lord.” For he doth not really call upon Him, who
longs for such things as are displeasing to Him. “There they trembled for fear, where no
fear was” (ver. 5): that is, for the loss of things temporal. For they said, “If we let Him thus
alone, all men will believe on Him; and the Romans will come, and take away both our place
and nation.”490 They feared to lose an earthly kingdom, where no fear was; and they lost
the kingdom of heaven, which they ought to have feared. And this must be understood of
all temporal goods, the loss of which when men fear, they come not to things eternal.
7. “For God is in the just generation.” It refers to what went before, so that the sense is,
“shall not all they that work iniquity know that the Lord is in the just generation;”491 that
is, He is not in them who love the world. For it is unjust to leave the Maker of the worlds,
and “serve the creature more than the Creator.”492 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor,

God, because ye saw not in Him the pomp of the world: that they, whom he was calling,
should put their hope in God alone, not in the things that pass away.
8. “Who will give salvation to Israel out of Sion?” (ver. 7). Who but He whose humiliation
ye have despised? is understood. For He will come in glory to the judgment of the quick
and the dead, and the kingdom of the just: that, forasmuch as in that humble coming
“blindness hath happened in part unto Israel, that the fulness of the Gentiles might enter
in,”493 in that other should happen what follows, “and so all Israel should be saved.” For
the Apostle too takes that testimony of Isaiah, where it is said, “There shall come out of Sion
He who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:”494 for the Jews, as it is here, “Who shall
give salvation to Israel out of Sion?” “When the Lord shall turn away the captivity of His
people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.”495 It is a repetition, as is usual: for I
suppose, “Israel shall be glad,” is the same as, “Jacob shall rejoice.”

Psalm XIV
Psalm XV.496
A psalm of David himself.
1. Touching this title there is no question. “O Lord who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle?”
(ver. 1). Although tabernacle be sometimes used even for an everlasting habitation: yet when
tabernacle is taken in its proper meaning, it is a thing of war. Hence soldiers are called tent-
fellows,497 as having their tents together. This sense is assisted by the words, “Who shall
sojourn?” For we war with the devil for a time, and then we need a tabernacle wherein we
may refresh ourselves. Which specially points out the faith of the temporal Dispensation,
which was wrought for us in time through the Incarnation of the Lord. “And who shall rest
in Thy holy mountain?” Here perhaps he signifies at once the eternal habitation itself, 498
that we should understand by “mountain” the supereminence of the love of Christ in life
eternal.499
2. “He who walketh without stain, and worketh righteousness” (ver. 2). Here he has laid
down the proposition; in what follows he sets it forth in detail.
3. “Who speaketh the truth in his heart.” For some have truth on their lips, and not in
their heart. As if one should deceitfully point out a road, knowing that there were robbers
there, and should say, If you go this way, you will be safe from robbers; and it should turn
out that in fact there were no robbers found there: he has spoken the truth, but not in his
heart. For he supposed it to be otherwise, and spoke the truth in ignorance. Therefore it is
not enough to speak the truth, unless it be so also in heart. “Who hath practised no deceit
in his tongue” (ver. 3). Deceit is practised with the tongue, when one thing is professed with
the mouth, another concealed in the breast. “Nor done evil to his neighbour.” It is well
known that by “neighbour,” every man should be understood. “And hath not entertained
slander against his neighbour,” that is, hath not readily or rashly given credence to an accuser.
4. “The malicious one hath been brought to nought in his sight”500 (ver. 4). This is
perfection, that the malicious one have no force against a man; and that this be “in his sight;”
that is, that he know most surely that the malicious is not, save when the mind turns itself
away from the eternal and immutable form501 of her own Creator to the form of the creature,
which was made out of nothing. “But those that fear the Lord, He glorifieth:” the Lord

Himself, that is. Now “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”502 As then the
things above belong to the perfect, so what he is now going to say belongs to beginners.
5. “Who sweareth unto his neighbour, and deceiveth him not.” “Who hath not given
his money upon usury, and hath not taken rewards against the innocent” (ver. 5). These are
no great things: but he who is not able to do even this, much less able is he to speak the truth
in his heart, and to practise no deceit in his tongue, but as the truth is in the heart, so to
profess and have it in his mouth, “yea, yea; nay, nay;” 503 and to do no evil to his neighbour,
that is, to any man; and to entertain no slander against his neighbour: all which are the virtues
of the perfect, in whose sight the malicious one hath been brought to nought. Yet he con-
cludes even these lesser things thus, “Whoso doeth these things shall not be moved for ever:”
that is, he shall attain unto those greater things, wherein is great and unshaken stability. For
even the very tenses are, perhaps not without cause, so varied, as that in the conclusion
above the past tense should be used, but in this the future. For there it was said, “The mali-
cious one hath been brought to nought in his sight:” but here, “shall not be moved for ever.”

Psalm XV
Psalm XVI.504
The inscription of the title, of David himself.505
1. Our King in this Psalm speaks in the character of the human506 nature He assumed,
of whom the royal title at the time of His passion was eminently set forth.
2. Now He saith as follows; “Preserve me, O Lord, for in Thee have I hoped” (ver. 1): “I
have said to the Lord, Thou art my God, for Thou requirest not my goods” (ver. 2): for with
my goods Thou dost not look to be made blessed.
3. “To the saints who are on His earth” (ver. 3): to the saints who have placed their hope
in the land of the living, the citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, whose spiritual conversation
is, by the anchor of hope, fixed in that country, which is rightly called God’s earth; although
as yet in this earth too they be conversant in the flesh. “He hath wonderfully fulfilled all My
wishes in them.” To those saints then He hath wonderfully fulfilled all My wishes in their
advancement, whereby they have perceived, how both the humanity of My divinity hath
profited them that I might die, and the divinity of the humanity that I might rise again.
4. “Their infirmities have been multiplied”507 (ver. 4): their infirmities have been mul-
tiplied not for their destruction, but that they might long for the Physician. “Afterwards
they made haste.” Accordingly after infirmities multiplied they made haste, that they might
be healed. “I will not gather together their assemblies by blood.” For their assemblies shall
not be carnal, nor will I gather them together as one propitiated by the blood of cattle.508
“Nor will I be mindful of their names within My lips.” But by a spiritual change what they
have been shall be forgotten; nor by Me shall they be any more called either sinners, or en-
emies, or men; but righteous, and My brethren, and sons of God through My peace.
5. “The Lord is the portion of Mine inheritance, and of My cup” (ver. 5). For together
with Me they shall possess the inheritance, the Lord Himself. Let others choose for themselves
portions, earthly and temporal, to enjoy: the portion of the Saints is the Lord eternal. Let
others drink of deadly pleasures, the portion of My cup is the Lord. In that I say, “Mine,” I
include the Church: for where the Head is, there is the body also. For into the inheritance
will I gather together their assemblies, and by the inebriation of the cup I will forget their
old names. “Thou art He who will restore to Me My inheritance:” that to these too, whom
I free, may be known “the glory wherein I was with Thee before the world was made.”509

Psalm XVI
Psalm XVI
For Thou wilt not restore to Me that which I never lost, but Thou wilt restore to these, who
have lost it, the knowledge of that glory: in whom because I am, Thou wilt restore to Me.
6. “The lines have fallen to me in glorious places” (ver. 6). The boundaries of my posses-
sion have fallen in Thy glory as it were by lot, like as God is the possession of the Priests and
Levites.510 “For Mine inheritance is glorious to Me.” “For Mine inheritance is glorious,”
not to all, but to them that see; in whom because I am, “it is to Me.”
7. “I will bless the Lord, who hath given Me understanding” (ver. 7): whereby this inher-
itance may be seen and possessed. “Yea moreover too even unto night my reins have
chastened Me.” Yea besides understanding, even unto death, My inferior part, the assumption
of flesh, hath instructed Me, that I might experience the darkness of mortality, which that
understanding hath not.
8. “I foresaw the Lord in My sight always” (ver. 8). But coming into things that pass
away, I removed not Mine eye from Him who abideth ever, foreseeing this, that to Him I
should return after passing through the things temporal. “For He is on My right hand, that
I should not be moved.” For He favoureth Me, that I should abide fixedly in Him.
9. “Wherefore My heart was glad, and My tongue exulted” (ver. 9). Wherefore both in
My thoughts is gladness, and in my words exultation. “Moreover too My flesh shall rest in
hope.” Moreover too My flesh shall not fail unto destruction, but shall sleep in hope of the
resurrection.
10. “For Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell” (ver. 10). For Thou wilt neither give My
soul for a possession to those parts below. “Neither wilt Thou grant Thine Holy One to see
corruption.” Neither wilt Thou suffer that sanctified body, whereby others are to be also
sanctified, to see corruption. “Thou hast made known to Me the paths of life” (ver. 11).
Thou hast made known through Me the paths of humiliation, that511 men might return to
life, from whence they fell through pride; in whom because I am, “Thou hast made known
to Me.” “Thou wilt fill Me with joy with Thy countenance.” Thou wilt fill them with joy,
that they should seek nothing further, when they shall see Thee “face to face;” in whom be-
cause I am, “Thou wilt fill Me.” “Pleasure is at Thy right hand even to the end.” Pleasure is
in Thy favour and mercy in this life’s journey, leading on even to the end of the glory of Thy
countenance.512

Psalm XVI
Psalm XVII.513
A prayer of David himself.
1. This prayer must be assigned to the Person of the Lord, with the addition of the
Church, which is His body.
2. “Hear My righteousness, O God, consider My supplication” (ver. 1). “Hearken unto
My prayer, not in deceitful lips:” not going forth to Thee in deceitful lips. “Let My judgment
from Thy countenance go forth” (ver. 2). From the enlightening of the knowledge of Thee,
let Me judge truth. Or at least, let My judgment go forth, not in deceitful lips, from Thy
countenance, that is, that I may not in judging utter aught else than I understand in Thee.
“Let Mine eyes see equity:” the eyes, of course, of the heart.
3. “Thou hast proved and visited Mine heart in the night-season” (ver. 3). For this Mine
heart hath been proved by the visitation of tribulation. “Thou hast examined Me by fire,
and iniquity hath not been found in Me.” Now not night only, in that it is wont to disturb,
but fire also, in that it burns, is this tribulation to be called; whereby when I was examined
I was found righteous.
4. “That My mouth may not speak the works of men” (ver. 4). That nothing may proceed
out of My mouth, but what relates to Thy glory and praise; not to the works of men, which
they do beside Thy will. “Because of the words of Thy lips.”514 Because of the words of Thy
peace, or of Thy prophets. “I have kept hard ways.” I have kept the toilsome ways of human
mortality and suffering.
5. “To perfect My steps in Thy paths” (ver. 5). That the love of the Church might be
perfected in the strait ways, whereby she arrives at Thy rest. “That My footsteps be not
moved.” That the signs of My way, which, like footsteps, have been imprinted on the Sacra-
ments and Apostolical writings, be not moved, that they may mark them who would follow
Me. Or at least, that I may still abide fixedly in eternity, after that I have accomplished the
hard ways, and have finished My steps in the straits of Thy paths.
6. “I have cried out, for Thou hast heard Me, O God” (ver. 6). With a free and strong
effort have I directed My prayers unto Thee: for that I might have this power, Thou hast
heard Me when praying more weakly. “Incline Thine ear to Me, and hear My words.” Let
not Thy hearing forsake My humiliation.
7. “Make Thy mercies marvellous” (ver. 7). Let not Thy mercies be disesteemed, lest
they be loved too little.
8. “Who savest them that hope in Thee from such as resist Thy right hand:” from such
as resist the favour, whereby Thou favourest Me. “Keep Me, O Lord, as the apple of Thine
eye” (ver. 8): which seems very little and minute: yet by it is the sight of the eye directed,

Psalm XVII
whereby the light is distinguished from the darkness; as by Christ’s humanity, the divinity
of the Judgment515 distinguishing between the righteous and sinners. “In the covering of
Thy wings protect Me.” In the defence of Thy love and mercy protect Me. “From the face
of the ungodly who have troubled Me” (ver. 9).
9. “Mine enemies have compassed about My soul;” “they have shut up their own fat”
(ver. 10). They have been covered with their own gross joy, after that their desire hath been
satiated with wickedness. “Their mouth hath spoken pride.” And therefore their mouth
spoke pride, in saying, “Hail, King of the Jews,”516 and other like words.
10. “Casting Me forth they have now compassed Me about” (ver. 11). Casting Me forth
outside the city, they have now compassed Me about on the Cross. “Their eyes they have
determined to turn down on the earth.” The bent of their heart they have determined to
turn down on these earthly things: deeming Him, who was slain, to endure a mighty evil,
and themselves, that slew Him, none.
11. “As a lion ready for prey, have they taken Me” (ver. 12). They have taken Me, like
that adversary who “walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”517 “And as a lion’s
whelp dwelling in secret places.” And as his whelp, the people to whom it was said, “Ye are
of your father the devil:”518 meditating on the snares, whereby they might circumvent and
destroy the just One.
12. “Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down” (ver. 13). Arise, O Lord, Thou
whom they suppose to be asleep, and regardless of men’s iniquities; be they blinded before
by their own malice, that vengeance may prevent their deed; and so cast them down.
13. “Deliver My soul from the ungodly.” Deliver My soul, by restoring Me after the
death, which the ungodly have inflicted on Me. “Thy weapon: from the enemies of Thine
hand” (ver. 14). For My soul is Thy weapon, which Thy hand, that is, Thy eternal Power,
hath taken to subdue thereby the kingdoms of iniquity, and divide the righteous from the
ungodly. This weapon then “deliver from the enemies of Thine hand,” that is, of Thy Power,
that is, from Mine enemies. “Destroy them, O Lord, from off the earth, scatter them in their
life.” O Lord, destroy them from off the earth, which they inhabit, scatter them throughout
the world in this life, which only they think their life, who519 despair of life eternal. “And
by Thy hidden things their belly hath been filled.” Now not only this visible punishment
shall overtake them, but also their memory hath been filled with sins, which as darkness are
hidden from the light of Thy truth, that they should forget God. “They have been filled with

swine’s flesh.” They have been filled with uncleanness, treading under foot the pearls of
God’s words. “And they have left the rest to their babes:” crying out, “This sin be upon us
and upon our children.”520
14. “But I shall appear in Thy righteousness in Thy sight” (ver. 15). But I, Who have
not appeared to them that, with their filthy and darkened heart, cannot see the light of wis-
dom, “I shall appear in Thy righteousness in Thy sight.”
“I shall be satiated, when Thy glory shall be manifested.” And when they have been sa-
tiated with their uncleanness, that they could not know Me, I shall be satiated, when Thy
glory shall be manifested, in them that know Me. In that verse indeed where it is said, “filled
with swine’s flesh,” some copies have, “filled with children:” for from the ambiguity of the
Greek521 a double interpretation has resulted. Now by “children” we understand works;
and as by good children, good works, so by evil, evil.

Psalm XVII
Psalm XVIII.522
To the end, for the servant of the Lord, David himself.
1. That is, for the strong of hand, Christ in His Manhood.523 “The words of this song
which he spoke to the Lord on the day when the Lord delivered him out of the hands of his
enemies, and of the hand of Saul; and he said, On the day when the Lord delivered him out
of the hands of his enemies and of the hand of Saul:” namely, the king of the Jews, whom
they had demanded for themselves.524 For as “David” is said to be by interpretation, strong
of hand; so “Saul” is said to be demanding. Now it is well known, how that People demanded
for themselves a king, and received him for their king, not according to the will of God, but
according to their own will.
2. Christ, then, and the Church, that is, whole Christ, the Head and the Body, saith here,
“I will love Thee, O Lord, My strength” (ver. 1). I will love Thee, O Lord, by whom I am
strong.525
3. “O Lord, My stay, and My refuge, and My deliverer” (ver. 2). O Lord, who hast stayed
Me, because I sought refuge with Thee: and I sought refuge, because Thou hast delivered
Me. “My God is My helper; and I will hope in Him.” My God, who hast first afforded me
the help of Thy call, that I might be able to hope in Thee. “My defender, and the horn of
My salvation, and My redeemer.” My defender, because I have not leant upon Myself, lifting
up as it were the horn of pride against Thee; but have found Thee a horn indeed, that is, the
sure height of salvation: and that I might find it, Thou redeemedst Me.
4. “With praise will I call upon the Lord, and I shall be safe from Mine enemies” (ver.
3). Seeking not My own but the Lord’s glory, I will call upon Him, and there shall be no
means whereby the errors of ungodliness can hurt Me.
5. “The pains of death,” that is, of the flesh, have “compassed Me about. And the over-
flowings of ungodliness have troubled Me” (ver. 4). Ungodly troubles526 stirred up for a
time, like torrents of rain which will soon subside, have come on to trouble Me.
6. “The pains of hell compassed Me about” (ver. 5). Among those that compassed Me
about to destroy Me, were pains of envy, which work death, and lead on to the hell of sin.
“The snares of death prevented Me.” They prevented Me, so that they wished to hurt Me
first, which shall afterwards be recompensed unto them. Now they seize unto destruction
such men as they have evilly persuaded by the boast of righteousness: in the name but not
in the reality of which they glory against the Gentiles.

Psalm XVIII
7. “And in Mine oppression I called upon the Lord, and cried unto My God. And He
heard My voice from His holy temple” (ver. 6). He heard from My heart, wherein He
dwelleth, My voice. “And My cry in His sight entered into His ears;” and My cry, which I
utter, not in the ears of men, but inwardly before Him Himself, “entered into His ears.”
8. “And the earth was moved and trembled” (ver. 7). When the Son of Man was thus
glorified, sinners were moved and trembled. “And the foundations of the mountains were
troubled.” And the hopes of the proud, which were in this life, were troubled. “And were
moved, for God was wroth with them.” That is, that the hope of temporal goods might have
now no more establishment in the hearts of men.
9. “There went up smoke in His wrath” (ver. 8). The tearful supplication of penitents
went up, when they came to know God’s threatenings against the ungodly. “And fire burneth
from His face.” And the ardour of love after repentance burns by the knowledge of Him.
“Coals were kindled from Him.” They, who were already dead, abandoned by the fire of
good desire and the light of righteousness, and who remained in coldness and darkness, re-
enkindled and enlightened, have come to life again.
10. “And He bowed the heaven, and came down” (ver. 9). And He humbled the just
One, that He might descend to men’s infirmity. “And darkness under His feet.” And the
ungodly, who savour of things earthly, in the darkness of their own malice, knew not Him:
for the earth under His feet is as it were His footstool.
11. “And He mounted above the cherubim, and did fly” (ver. 10). And He was exalted
above the fulness of knowledge, that no man should come to Him but by love: for “love is
the fulfilling of the law.”527 And full soon He showed to His lovers that He is incomprehens-
ible, lest they should suppose that He is comprehended by corporeal imaginations. “He flew
above the wings of the winds.” But that swiftness, whereby He showed Himself to be incom-
prehensible, is above the powers of souls, whereon as upon wings they raise themselves from
earthly fears into the air of liberty.
12. “And hath made darkness His hiding place” (ver. 11). And hath settled the obscurity
of the Sacraments, and the hidden hope in the heart of believers, where He may lie hid, and
not abandon them. In this darkness too, wherein “we yet walk by faith, and not by sight,”528
as long as “we hope for what we see not, and with patience wait for it.”529 “Round about
Him is His tabernacle.” Yet they that believe Him turn to Him and encircle Him; for that
He is in the midst of them, since He is equally the friend of all, in whom as in a tabernacle
He at this time dwells. “Dark water in clouds of air.” Nor let any one on this account, if he
understand the Scripture, imagine that he is already in that light, which will be when we

shall have come out of faith into sight: for in the prophets and in all the preachers of the
word of God there is obscure teaching.
13. “In respect of the brightness in His sight” (ver. 12): in comparison with the brightness,
which is in the sight of His manifestation. “His clouds have passed over.” The preachers of
His word are not now bounded by the confines of Judæa, but have passed over to the Gentiles.
“Hail and coals of fire.” Reproofs are figured,530 whereby, as by hail, the hard hearts are
bruised: but if a cultivated and genial soil, that is, a godly mind, receive them, the hail’s
hardness dissolves into water, that is, the terror of the lightning-charged,531 and as it were
frozen, reproof dissolves into satisfying doctrine; and hearts kindled by the fire of love revive.
All these things in His clouds have passed over to the Gentiles.
14. “And the Lord hath thundered from heaven” (ver. 13). And in confidence of the
Gospel the Lord hath sounded forth from the heart of the just One. “And the Highest gave
His voice;” that we might entertain it, and in the depth of human things, might hear things
heavenly.
15. “And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them” (ver. 14). And He sent out
Evangelists traversing straight paths on the wings of strength, not in their own power, but
His by whom they were sent. And “He scattered them,” to whom they were sent, that to
some of them they should be “the savour of life unto life, to others the savour of death unto
death.”532 “And He multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.” And He multiplied miracles,
and troubled them.
16. “And the fountains of water were seen. And the fountains of water springing up into
everlasting life,”533 which were made in the preachers, were seen. “And the foundations of
the round world were revealed” (ver. 15). And the Prophets, who were not understood, and
upon whom was to be built the world of believers in the Lord, were revealed. “At Thy
chiding, O Lord:” crying out, “The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.”534 “At the
blasting of the breath of Thy displeasure;” saying, “Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish.”535
17. “He hath sent down from on high, and hath fetched Me (ver. 16): by calling out of
the Gentiles for an inheritance “a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle.”536 “He
530 Read “full lightning-charged reproofs.”

hath taken Me out of the multitude of waters.” He hath taken Me out of the multitude of
peoples.
18. “He hath delivered Me from My strongest enemies” (ver. 17). He hath delivered Me
from Mine enemies, who prevailed to the afflicting and overturning of this temporal life of
Mine. “And from them which hate Me; for they are too strong for Me:” as long as I am under
them knowing not God.
19. “They have prevented Me in the day of My affliction” (ver. 18). They have first injured
Me, in the time when I am bearing a mortal and toilsome body. “And the Lord hath become
My stay.” And since the stay of earthly pleasure was disturbed and torn up by the bitterness
of misery, the Lord hath become My stay.
20. “And hath brought Me forth into a broad place” (ver. 19). And since I was enduring
the straits of the flesh, He brought Me forth into the spiritual breadth of faith. “He hath
delivered Me, because He desired Me.” Before that I desired Him, He delivered Me from
My most powerful enemies (who were envious of Me when I once desired Him), and from
them that hated Me, because I do desire Him.
21. “And the Lord shall reward Me according to My righteousness” (ver. 20). And the
Lord shall reward Me according to the righteousness of My good will, who first showed
mercy, before that I had the good will. “And according to the cleanness of My hands He
will recompense Me.” And according to the cleanness of My deeds He will recompense Me,
who hath given Me to do well by bringing Me forth into the broad place of faith.
22. “Because I have kept the ways of the Lord” (ver. 21). That the breadth of good works,
that are by faith, and the long-suffering of perseverance should follow after.
23. “Nor have I walked impiously apart from My God.” “For all His judgments are537
in My sight” (ver. 22). “For” with persevering contemplation I weigh “all His judgments,”
that is, the rewards of the righteous, and the punishments of the ungodly, and the scourges
of such as are to be chastened, and the trials of such as are to be proved. “And I have not
cast out His righteousness from Me:” as they do that faint under their burden of them, and
return to their own vomit.
24. “And I shall be undefiled with Him, and I shall keep Myself from Mine iniquity”
(ver. 23).
25. “And the Lord shall reward Me according to My righteousness (ver. 24). Accordingly
not only for the breadth of faith, which worketh by love; but also for the length of persever-
ance, will the Lord reward Me according to My righteousness. “And according to the
cleanness of My hands in the sight of His eyes.” Not as men see, but “in the sight of His
eyes.” For “the things that are seen are temporal; but the things that are not seen are etern-
al:”538 whereto the height of hope appertains.

26. “With the holy Thou shalt be holy” (ver. 25). There is a hidden depth also, wherein
Thou art known to be holy with the holy, for that Thou makest holy. “And with the harmless
Thou shalt be harmless.” For Thou harmest no man, but each one is bound by the bands of
his own sins.539
27. “And with the chosen Thou shalt be chosen.” (ver. 26). And by him whom Thou
choosest, Thou art chosen. “And with the froward Thou shalt be froward.” And with the
froward Thou seemest froward: for they say, “The way of the Lord is not right:”540 and their
way is not right.
28. “For Thou wilt make whole the humble people” (ver. 27). Now this seems froward
to the froward, that Thou wilt make them whole that confess their sins. “And Thou wilt
humble the eyes of the proud.” But them that are “ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seek
to establish their own,”541 Thou wilt humble.
29. “For thou wilt light My candle, O Lord” (ver. 28). For our light is not from ourselves;
but “Thou wilt light my candle, O Lord. O my God, Thou wilt enlighten my darkness.” For
we through our sins are darkness; but “Thou, O my God, wilt enlighten my darkness.”
30. “For by Thee shall I be delivered from temptation” (ver. 29). For not by myself, but
by Thee, shall I be delivered from temptation. “And in my God shall I leap over the wall.”
And not in myself, but in my God shall I leap over the wall, which sin has raised between
men and the heavenly Jerusalem.
31. “My God, His way is undefiled” (ver. 30). My God cometh not unto men, except
they shall have purified the way of faith, whereby He may come to them; for that “His way
is undefiled.” “The words of the Lord have been proved by fire.” The words of the Lord are
tried by the fire of tribulation. “He is the Protector of them that hope in Him.” And all that
hope not in themselves, but in Him, are not consumed by that same tribulation. For hope
followeth faith.
32. “For who is God, but the Lord?” (ver. 31) whom we serve. “And who God, but our
God?” And who is God, but the Lord? whom after good service we sons shall possess as the
hoped-for inheritance.
33. “God, who hath girded me with strength” (ver. 32). God, who hath girded me that
I might be strong, lest the loosely flowing folds of desire hinder my deeds and steps. “And
hath made my way undefiled.” And hath made the way of love, whereby I may come to Him,
undefiled, as the way of faith is undefiled, whereby He comes to me.
34. “Who hath made my feet perfect like harts’ feet” (ver. 33). Who hath made my love
perfect to surmount the thorny and dark entanglements of this world. “And will set me up
539 Prov. v. 22.
540 Ezek. xviii. 25.
541 Rom. x. 3.
Psalm XVIII
on high.” And will fix my aim on the heavenly habitation, that “I may be filled with all the
fulness of God.”542
35. “Who teacheth my hands for battle” (ver. 34). Who teacheth me to work for the
overthrow of mine enemies, who strive to shut the kingdom of heaven against us. “And
Thou hast made mine arms as a bow of steel.” And Thou hast made my earnest striving
after good works unwearied.
36. “And Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation, and Thy right hand hath held
me up” (ver. 35). And the favour of Thy grace hath held me up. “And Thy discipline hath
directed me to the end.” And Thy correction, not suffering me to wander from the way,
hath directed me that whatsoever I do, I refer to that end, whereby I may cleave to Thee.
“And this Thy discipline, it shall teach me.” And that same correction of Thine shall teach
me to attain to that, whereunto it hath directed me.
37. “Thou hast enlarged my steps under me” (ver. 36). Nor shall the straits of the flesh
hinder me; for Thou hast enlarged my love, working in gladness even with these mortal
things and members which are under me. “And my footsteps have not been weakened.”
And either my goings, or the marks which I have imprinted for the imitation of those that
follow, have not been weakened.
38. “I will follow up mine enemies, and seize them” (ver. 37). I will follow up my carnal
affections, and will not be seized by them, but will seize them, so that they may be consumed.
“And I will not turn, till they fail.” And from this purpose I will not turn myself to rest, till
they fail who make a tumult about me.
39. “I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand” (ver. 38): and they shall not
hold out against me. “They shall fall under my feet.” When they are cast down, I will place
before me the loves543 whereby I walk for evermore.
40. “And Thou hast girded me with strength to the war” (ver. 39). And the loose desires
of my flesh hast Thou bound up with strength, that in such a fight I may not be encumbered.
“Thou hast supplanted under me them that rose up against me.” Thou hast caused them to
be deceived, who followed upon me, that they should be brought under me, who desired to
be over me.
41. “And thou hast given mine enemies the back to me” (ver. 40). And thou hast turned
mine enemies, and hast made them to be a back to me, that is, to follow me. “And Thou
hast destroyed them that hate me.” But such other of them as have persisted in hatred, Thou
hast destroyed.
42. “They have cried out, and there was none to save them” (ver. 41). For who can save
them, whom Thou wouldest not save? “To the Lord, and He did not hear them.” Nor did
542 Eph. iii. 19.
543 See p. 37. “The foot of sinners; that is, their love.”
Psalm XVIII
they cry out to any chance one, but to the Lord: and He did not judge them worthy of being
heard, who depart not from their wickedness.
43. “And I will beat them as small as dust before the face of the wind” (ver. 42). And I
will beat them small; for dry they are, receiving not the shower of God’s mercy; that borne
aloft and puffed up with pride they may be hurried along from firm and unshaken hope,
and as it were from the earth’s solidity and stability. “As the clay of the streets I will destroy
them.” In their wanton and loose course along the broad ways of perdition, which many
walk, will I destroy them.
44. “Thou wilt deliver Me from the contradictions of the people” (ver. 43). Thou wilt
deliver Me from the contradictions of them who said, “If we send Him away, all the world
will go after Him.”544
45. “Thou shalt make Me the head of the Gentiles. A people whom I have not known
have served Me.” The people of the Gentiles, whom in bodily presence I have not visited,
have served Me. “At the hearing of the ear they have obeyed Me” (ver. 44). They have not
seen Me with the eye: but, receiving my preachers, at the hearing of the ear they have obeyed
Me.
46. “The strange children have lied unto Me.” Children, not to be called Mine, but rather
strange children, to whom it is rightly said, “Ye are of your father the devil,”545 have lied
unto Me. “The strange children have waxen old” (ver. 45). The strange children, to whom
for their renovation I brought the new Testament, have remained in the old man. “And they
have halted from their own paths.” And like those that are weak in one foot, for holding the
old they have rejected the new Testament, they have become halt, even in their old Law,
rather following their own traditions, than God’s. For they brought frivolous charges of
unwashen hands,546 because such were the paths, which themselves had made and worn
by long use, in wandering from the ways of God’s commands.
47. “The Lord liveth, and blessed be my God.” “But to be carnally minded is death:”547
for “the Lord liveth, and blessed be my God. And let the God of my salvation be exalted”
(ver. 46). And let me not think after an earthly fashion of the God of my salvation; nor look
from Him for this earthly salvation, but that on high.
48. “O God, who givest Me vengeance, and subduest the people under Me” (ver. 47). O
God, who avengest Me by subduing the people under Me. “My Deliverer from My angry
enemies:” the Jews crying out, “Crucify Him, Crucify Him.”548
544 John xi. 48, xii. 19.
545 John viii. 44.
546 Matt. xv. 2.
547 Rom. viii. 6.
548 John xix. 6.
Psalm XVIII
49. “From them that rise up against Me Thou wilt exalt Me” (ver. 48). From the Jews
that rise up against Me in My passion, Thou wilt exalt Me in My resurrection. “From the
unjust man Thou wilt deliver Me.” From their unjust rule Thou wilt deliver Me.
50. “For this cause will I confess to Thee among the Gentiles, O Lord” (ver. 49). For this
cause shall the Gentiles confess to Thee through Me, O Lord. “And I will sing unto Thy
Name.” And Thou shalt be more widely known by My good deeds.
51. “Magnifying the salvation of His King” (ver. 50). God, who magnifieth, so as to make
wonderful, the salvation, which His Son giveth to believers.549 “And showing mercy to His
Christ:” God, who showeth mercy to His Christ: “To David and to His seed for evermore:”
to the Deliverer Himself strong of hand, who hath overcome this world; and to them whom,
as believers in the Gospel, He hath begotten for evermore. What things soever are spoken
in this Psalm which cannot apply to the Lord Himself personally, that is to the Head of the
Church, must be referred to the Church. For whole Christ speaks here, in whom are all His
members.
549 [The epigraph of this Psalm in 2 Sam. xxiii. 1–5 seems to connect with Isa. lv. 3, and so with Acts xiii.
Psalm XVIII
Psalm XIX.550
To the end, a psalm of David himself.
1. It is a well-known title; nor does the Lord Jesus Christ say what follows, but it is said
of Him.
2. “The heavens tell out the glory of God” (ver. 1). The righteous Evangelists, in whom,
as in the heavens, God dwelleth, set forth the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, or the glory
wherewith the Son glorified the Father upon earth. “And the firmament showeth forth the
works of His hands.” And the firmament showeth forth the deeds of the Lord’s power, that
now made heaven by the assurance of the Holy Ghost, which before was earth by fear.
3. “Day unto day uttereth word” (ver. 2). To the spiritual the Spirit giveth out the fulness
of the unchangeable Wisdom of God, the Word which in the beginning is God with God.551
“And night unto night announceth knowledge.” And to the fleshly, as to those afar off, the
mortality of the flesh, by conveying faith, announceth future knowledge.
4. “There is no speech nor language, in which their voices are not heard” (ver. 3). In
which the voices of the Evangelists have not been heard, seeing that the Gospel was preached
in every tongue.
5. “Their sound is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world”552
(ver. 4).
6. “In the sun hath He set His tabernacle.” Now that He might war against the powers
of temporal error, the Lord, being about to send not peace but a sword on earth,553 in time,
or in manifestation, set so to say His military dwelling, that is, the dispensation of His in-
carnation. “And He as a bridegroom coming forth out of His chamber” (ver. 5). And He,
coming forth out of the Virgin’s womb, where God was united to man’s nature as a bride-
groom to a bride. “Rejoiced as a giant to run His way.” Rejoiced as One exceeding strong,
and surpassing all other men in power incomparable, not to inhabit, but to run His way.
For, “He stood not in the way of sinners.”554
7. “His going forth is from the highest heaven” (ver. 6). From the Father is His going
forth, not that in time, but from everlasting, whereby He was born of the Father. “And His
meeting is even to the height of heaven.” And in the fulness of the Godhead He meets even
to an equality with the Father.555 “And there is none that may hide himself from His heat.”

Psalm XIX
Psalm XIX
But whereas, “the Word was even made flesh, and dwelt in us,”556 assuming our mortality,
He permitted no man to excuse himself from the shadow of death; for the heat of the Word
penetrated even it.
8. “The law of the Lord is undefiled, converting souls” (ver. 7). The law of the Lord,
therefore, is Himself who came to fulfil the law, not to destroy it;557 an undefiled law, “Who
did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth,”558 not oppressing souls with the yoke of
bondage, but converting them to imitate Him in liberty. “The testimony of the Lord is sure,
giving wisdom to babes.” “The testimony of the Lord is sure;” for, “no man knoweth the
Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him,”559 which things have
been hidden from the wise and revealed to babes;560 for, “God resisteth the proud, but giveth
grace to the humble.”561
9. “The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart” (ver. 8). All the statutes of the
Lord are right in Him who taught not what He did not; that they who should imitate Him
might rejoice in heart, in those things which they should do freely with love, not slavishly
with fear. “The commandment of the Lord is lucid, enlightening the eyes.” “The command-
ment of the Lord is lucid,” with no veil of carnal observances, enlightening the sight of the
inner man.
10. “The fear of the Lord is chaste, enduring for ever” (ver. 9). “The fear of the Lord;”
not that distressing562 fear under the law, dreading exceedingly the withdrawal of temporal
goods, by the love of which the soul commits fornication; but that chaste fear wherewith
the Church, the more ardently she loves her Spouse, the more carefully does she take heed
of offending Him, and therefore, “perfect love casteth” not “out” this “fear,”563 but it endureth
for ever.
11. “The judgments of the Lord are true, justified together.” The judgments of Him,
who “judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son,”564 are justified in
truth unchangeably. For neither in His threatenings nor His promises doth God deceive
any man, nor can any withdraw either from the ungodly His punishment, or from the godly
His reward. “To be desired more than gold, and much precious stone” (ver. 10). Whether

Psalm XIX
it be “gold and stone itself much,” or “much precious,” or “much to be desired;” still, the
judgments of God are to be desired more than the pomp of this world; by desire of which
it is brought to pass that the judgments of God are not desired, but feared, or despised, or
not believed. But if any be himself gold and precious stone, that he may not be consumed
by fire, but received into the treasury of God, more than himself does he desire the judgments
of God, whose will he preferreth to his own. “And sweeter than honey and the honey comb.”
And whether one be even now honey, who, disenthralled already from the chains of this
life, is awaiting the day when he may come up to God’s feast; or whether he be yet as the
honey comb, wrapped about with this life as it were with wax, not mixed and become one
with it, but filling it, needing some pressure of God’s hand, not oppressing but expressing
it, whereby from life temporal it may be strained out into life eternal: to such an one the
judgments of God are sweeter than he himself is to himself, for that they are “sweeter than
honey and the honey comb.”
12. “For Thy servant keepeth them” (ver. 11). For to him who keepeth them not the day
of the Lord is bitter. “In keeping them there is great reward.” Not in any external benefit,
but in the thing itself, that God’s judgments are kept, is there great reward; great because
one rejoiceth therein.
13. “Who understandeth sins?” (ver. 12.) But what sort of sweetness can there be in sins,
where there is no understanding? For who can understand sins, which close the very eye,
to which truth is pleasant, to which the judgments of God are desirable and sweet? yea, as
darkness closes the eye, so do sins the mind, and suffer it not to see either the light, or itself.
14. “Cleanse me, O Lord, from my secret faults.” From the lusts which lie hid in me,
cleanse me, O Lord. “And from the” faults “of others preserve Thy servant” (ver. 13). Let
me not be led astray by others. For he is not a prey to the faults of others, who is cleansed
from his own. Preserve therefore from the lusts of others, not the proud man, and him who
would be his own master, but, Thy servant. “If they get not the dominion over me, then
shall I be undefiled.” If neither my own secret sins, nor those of others, get the dominion
over me, then shall I be undefiled. For there is no third source of sin, but one’s own secret
sin, by which the devil fell, and another’s sin, by which man is seduced, so as by consenting
to make it his own. “And I shall be cleansed from the great offence.” What but pride? for
there is none greater than apostasy from God, which is “the beginning of the pride of man.”565
And he shall indeed be undefiled, who is free from this offence also; for this is the last to
them who are returning to God, which was the first as they departed from Him.
15. “And the words of my mouth shall be pleasing, and the meditation of my heart is
always in Thy sight” (ver. 14). The meditation of my heart is not after the vain glory of
pleasing men, for now there is pride no more, but in Thy sight alway, who regardest a pure
565 Ecclus. x. 12.
Psalm XIX
conscience. “O Lord, my Helper, and my Redeemer”566 (ver. 15). O Lord, my Helper, in
my approach to Thee; for Thou art my Redeemer, that I might set out unto Thee: lest any
attributing to his own wisdom his conversion to Thee, or to his own strength his attaining
to Thee, should be rather driven back by Thee, who resistest the proud; for he is not cleansed
from the great offence, nor pleasing in Thy sight, who redeemest us that we may be converted,
and helpest us that we may attain unto Thee.
566 [Here the word is rendered “Redeemer” in the Septuagint, and is the same in the Hebrew as in Job xix.
Psalm XIX
Psalm XX.567
To the end, a psalm of David.
1. This is a well-known title; and it is not Christ who speaks; but the prophet speaks to
Christ, under the form of wishing, foretelling things to come.568
2. “The Lord hear Thee in the day of trouble” (ver. 1). The Lord hear Thee in the day
in which Thou saidst, “Father glorify Thy Son.”569 “The name of the God of Jacob protect
Thee.” For to Thee belongeth the younger people. Since “the elder shall serve the younger.”570
3. “Send Thee help from the Holy, and from Sion defend Thee” (ver. 2). Making for
Thee a sanctified Body, the Church, from watching571 safe, which waiteth when Thou shalt
come from the wedding.
4. “Be mindful of all Thy sacrifice” (ver. 3). Make us mindful of all Thy injuries and
despiteful treatment, which Thou hast borne for us. “And be Thy whole burnt offering made
fat.” And turn the cross, whereon Thou wast wholly offered up to God, into the joy of the
resurrection.
5. “Diapsalma.” The Lord render to Thee according to Thine Heart” (ver. 4). The Lord
render to Thee, not according to their heart, who thought by persecution they could destroy
Thee; but according to Thine Heart, wherein Thou knewest what profit Thy passion would
have.572 “And fulfil all Thy counsel.” “And fulfil all Thy counsel,” not only that whereby
Thou didst lay down Thy life for Thy friends,573 that the corrupted grain might rise again
to more abundance;574 but that also whereby “blindness in part hath happened unto Israel,
that the fulness of the Gentiles might enter in, and so all Israel might be saved.”575
6. “We will exult in Thy salvation” (ver. 5). We will exult in that death will in no wise
hurt Thee; for so Thou wilt also show that it cannot hurt us either. “And in the name of the
Lord our God will we be magnified.” And the confession of Thy name shall not only not
destroy us, but shall even magnify us.
7. “The Lord fulfil all Thy petitions.” The Lord fulfil not only the petitions which Thou
madest on earth, but those also whereby Thou intercedest for us in heaven. “Now have I
known that the Lord hath saved his Christ” (ver. 6). Now hath it been shown to me in

prophecy, that the Lord will raise up His Christ again. “He will hear Him from His holy
heaven.” He will hear Him not from earth only, where He prayed to be glorified;576 but
from heaven also, where interceding for us at the Right Hand of the Father,577 He hath from
thence shed abroad the Holy Spirit on them that believe on Him. “In strength is the safety
of His right hand.” Our strength is in the safety of His favour, when even out of tribulation
He giveth help, that “when we are weak, then we may be strong.”578 “For vain is” that “safety
of man,”579 which comes not of His right hand but of His left: for thereby are they lifted up
to great pride, whosoever in their sins have secured a temporal safety.
8. “Some in chariots, and some in horses” (ver. 7). Some are drawn away by the ever
moving succession of temporal goods; and some are preferred to proud honours, and in
them exult: “But we will exult in the name of the Lord our God.” But we, fixing our hope
on things eternal, and not seeking our own glory, will exult in the name of the Lord our
God.
9. “They have been bound, and fallen” (ver. 8). And therefore were they bound by the
lust of temporal things, fearing to spare the Lord, lest they should lose their place by “the
Romans:”580 and rushing violently on the stone of offence and rock of stumbling, they fell
from the heavenly hope: to whom the blindness in part of Israel hath happened, being ignor-
ant of God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their own.581 “But we are risen, and
stand upright.” But we, that the Gentile people might enter in, out of the stones raised up
as children to Abraham,582 who followed not after righteousness, have attained to it, and
are risen;583 and not by our own strength, but being justified by faith, we stand upright.
10. “O Lord, save the King:” that He, who in His Passion hath shown us an example of
conflict, should also offer up our sacrifices, the Priest raised from the dead, and established
in heaven. “And hear us in the day when we shall call on Thee” (ver. 9). And as He now of-
fereth for us, “hear us in the day when we shall call on Thee.”

Psalm XX
Psalm XXI.584
To the end, a psalm of David himself.
1. The title is a familiar one; the Psalm is of Christ.585
2. “O Lord, the King shall rejoice in Thy strength” (ver. 1). O Lord, in Thy strength,
whereby the Word was made flesh, the Man Christ Jesus shall rejoice. “And shall exult ex-
ceedingly in Thy salvation.” And in that, whereby Thou quickenest all things, shall exult
exceedingly.
3. “Thou hast given Him the desire of His soul” (ver. 2). He desired to eat the Passover,586
and to lay down His life when He would, and again when He would to take it; and Thou
hast given it to Him.587 “And hast not deprived Him of the good pleasure of His lips.” “My
peace,” saith He, “I leave with you:”588 and it was done.
4. “For Thou hast presented Him with the blessings of sweetness” (ver. 3). Because He
had first quaffed the blessing of Thy sweetness, the gall of our sins did not hurt Him.
“Diapsalma. Thou hast set a crown of precious stone on His Head.”589 At the beginning of
His discoursing precious stones were brought, and compassed Him about;590 His disciples,
from whom the commencement of His preaching should be made.
5. “He asked life; and Thou gavest Him:” He asked a resurrection, saying, “Father,
glorify Thy Son;”591 and Thou gavest it Him, “Length of days for ever and ever” (ver. 4).
The prolonged ages of this world which the Church was to have, and after them an eternity,
world without end.
6. “His glory is great in Thy salvation” (ver. 5). Great indeed is His glory in the salvation,
whereby Thou hast raised Him up again. “Glory and great honour shalt Thou lay upon
Him.” But Thou shalt yet add unto Him glory and great honour, when Thou shalt place
Him in heaven at Thy right hand.
7. “For Thou shalt give Him blessing for ever and ever.” This is the blessing which Thou
shalt give Him for ever and ever: “Thou shalt make Him glad in joy together with Thy
countenance” (ver. 6). According to His manhood, Thou shalt make Him glad together with
Thy countenance, which He lifted up to Thee.

Psalm XXI
Psalm XXI
8. “For the King hopeth in the Lord.” For the King is not proud, but humble in heart,
he hopeth in the Lord. “And in the mercy of the Most Highest He shall not be moved” (ver.
7). And in the mercy of the Most Highest His obedience even unto the death of the Cross
shall not disturb His humility.
9. “Let Thy hand be found by all Thine enemies.” Be Thy power, O King, when Thou
comest to judgment, found by all Thine enemies; who in Thy humiliation discerned it not.
“Let Thy right hand find out all that hate Thee” (ver. 8). Let the glory, wherein Thou reignest
at the right hand of the Father, find out for punishment in the day of judgment all that hate
Thee; for that now they have not found it.
10. “Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven:” Thou shalt make them on fire within, by
the consciousness of their ungodliness: “In the time of Thy countenance:” in the time of
Thy manifestation. “The Lord shall trouble them in His wrath, and the fire shall devour
them” (ver. 9). And then, being troubled by the vengeance of the Lord, after the accusation
of their conscience, they shall be given up to eternal fire, to be devoured.
11. “Their fruit shalt Thou destroy out of the earth.” Their fruit, because it is earthly,
shalt Thou destroy out of the earth. “And their seed from the sons of men” (ver. 10). And
their works; or, whomsoever they have seduced, Thou shalt not reckon among the sons of
men, whom Thou hast called into the everlasting inheritance.
12. “Because they turned evils against Thee.” Now this punishment shall be recompensed
to them, because the evils which they supposed to hang over them by Thy reign, they turned
against Thee to Thy death. “They imagined a device, which they were not able to establish”
(ver. 11). They imagined a device, saying, “It is expedient that one die for all:”592 which they
were not able to establish, not knowing what they said.
13. “For Thou shalt set them low.” For Thou shalt rank them among those from whom
in degradation and contempt Thou wilt turn away. “In Thy leavings593 Thou shalt make
ready their countenance” (ver. 12). And in these things that Thou leavest, that is, in the desires
of an earthly kingdom, Thou shalt make ready their shamelessness for Thy passion.
14. “Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength” (ver. 13). Be Thou, Lord, whom in hu-
miliation they did not discern, exalted in Thy strength, which they thought weakness. “We
will sing and praise Thy power.” In heart and in deed we will celebrate and make known
Thy marvels.
592 John xi. 50.

Psalm XXI
Psalm XXII.594
To the end, for the taking up of the morning, a psalm of David.595
1. “To the end,” for His own resurrection, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself speaketh.596
For in the morning on the first day of the week was His resurrection, whereby He was taken
up, into eternal life, “Over whom death shall have no more dominion.”597 Now what follows
is spoken in the person of The Crucified. For from the head of this Psalm are the words,
which He cried out, whilst hanging on the Cross, sustaining also the person of the old man,
whose mortality He bare. For our old man was nailed together with Him to the Cross.598
2. “O God, my God, look upon me, why hast Thou forsaken599 me far from my salva-
tion?” (ver. 1). Far removed from my salvation: for “salvation is far from sinners.”600 “The
words of my sins.” For these are not the words of righteousness, but of my sins. For it is the
old man nailed to the Cross that speaks, ignorant even of the reason why God hath forsaken
him: or else it may be thus, The words of my sins are far from my salvation.
3. “My God, I will cry unto Thee in the daytime, and Thou wilt not hear” (ver. 2). My
God, I will cry unto Thee in the prosperous circumstances of this life, that they be not
changed; and Thou wilt not hear, because I shall cry unto Thee in the words of my sins.
“And in the night-season, and not to my folly.” And so in the adversities of this life will I
cry to Thee for prosperity; and in like manner Thou wilt not hear. And this Thou doest not
to my folly, but rather that I may have wisdom to know what Thou wouldest have me cry
for, not with the words of sins out of longing for life temporal, but with the words of turning
to Thee for life eternal.
4. “But Thou dwellest in the holy place, O Thou praise of Israel” (ver. 3). But Thou
dwellest in the holy place, and therefore wilt not hear the unclean words of sins. The “praise”
of him that seeth Thee; not of him who hath sought his own praise in tasting of the forbidden
fruit, that on the opening of his bodily eyes he should endeavour to hide himself from Thy
sight.
5. “Our Fathers hoped in Thee.” All the righteous, namely, who sought not their own
praise, but Thine. “They hoped in Thee, and Thou deliveredst them” (ver. 4).

Psalm XXII
Psalm XXII
6. “They cried unto Thee, and were saved.” They cried unto Thee, not in the words of
sins, from which salvation is far; and therefore were they saved. “They hoped in Thee, and
were not confounded” (ver. 5). “They hoped in Thee,” and their hope did not deceive them.
For they placed it not in themselves.
7. “But I am a worm, and no man” (ver. 6). But I, speaking now not in the person of
Adam, but I in My own person, Jesus Christ, was born without human generation in the
flesh, that I might be as man beyond men; that so at least human pride might deign to imitate
My humility. “The scorn of men, and outcast of the people.” In which humility I was made
the scorn of men, so as that it should be said, as a reproachful railing, “Be thou His dis-
ciple:”601 and that the people despise Me.
8. “All that saw Me laughed Me to scorn” (ver. 7). All that saw Me derided Me. “And
spake with the lips, and shook the head.”602 And they spoke, not with the heart, but with
the lips.
9. For they shook their head in derision, saying, “He trusted in the Lord, let Him deliver
Him:”603 “let Him save Him, since He desireth Him” (ver. 8). These were their words; but
they were spoken “with the lips.”
10. “Since Thou art He who drew Me out of the womb” (ver. 9). Since Thou art He who
drew Me, not only out of that Virgin womb (for this is the law of all men’s birth, that they
be drawn out of the womb), but also out of the womb of the Jewish nation; by the darkness
whereof he is covered, and not yet born into the light of Christ, whosoever places his salvation
in the carnal observance of the Sabbath, and of circumcision, and the like. “My hope from
My mother’s breasts.” “My hope,” O God, not from the time when I began to be fed by the
milk of the Virgin’s breasts; for it was even before; but from the breasts of the Synagogue,
as I have said, out of the womb, Thou hast drawn Me, that I should not suck in the customs
of the flesh.
11. “I have been strengthened in Thee from the womb” (ver. 10). It is the womb of the
Synagogue, which did not carry Me, but threw Me out: but I fell not, for Thou heldest me.
“From My mother’s womb Thou art My God.” “From My mother’s womb: My mother’s
womb did not cause that, as a babe, I should be forgetful of Thee.
12. “Thou art My God,” “depart not from Me; for trouble is hard at hand” (ver. 11).
Thou art, therefore, My God, depart not from Me; for trouble is nigh unto Me; for it is in
My body. “For there is none to help.” For who helpeth, if Thou helpest not?
601 John ix. 28.
602 Matt. xxvii. 39.
603 Matt. xxvii. 43.
Psalm XXII
13. “Many calves came about Me.” The multitude of the wanton populace came about
Me. “Fat bulls closed Me in” (ver. 12). And their leaders, glad at My oppression, “closed Me
in.”
14. “They opened their mouth upon Me” (ver. 13). They opened their mouth upon Me,
not out of Thy Scripture, but of their own lusts. “As a ravening and roaring lion.” As a lion,
whose ravening is, that I was taken and led; and whose roaring, “Crucify, Crucify.”604
15. “I was poured out like water, and all My bones were scattered” (ver. 14). “I was
poured out like water,” when My persecutors fell: and through fear, the stays of My body,
that is, the Church, My disciples were scattered from Me.605 “My heart became as melting
wax, in the midst of my belly.” My wisdom, which was written of Me in the sacred books,
was, as if hard and shut up, not understood: but after that the fire of My Passion was applied,
it was, as if melted, manifested, and entertained in the memory of My Church.
16. “My strength dried up as a potsherd” (ver. 15). My strength dried up by My Passion;
not as hay, but a potsherd, which is made stronger by fire. “And My tongue cleaved to My
jaws.” And they, through whom I was soon to speak, kept My precepts in their hearts. “And
Thou broughtest Me down to the dust of death.” And to the ungodly appointed to death,
whom the wind casteth forth as dust from the face of the earth, 606 Thou broughtest Me
down.
17. “For many dogs came about Me” (ver. 16). For many came about Me barking, not
for truth, but for custom. “The council of the malignant came about Me.” The council of
the malignant besieged Me.607 “They pierced My hands and feet.” They pierced with nails
My hands and feet.
18. “They numbered distinctly all My bones” (ver. 17). They numbered distinctly all
My bones, while extended on the wood of the Cross. “Yea, these same regarded, and beheld
Me.” Yea, these same, that is, unchanged, regarded and beheld Me.
19. “They divided My garments for themselves, and cast the lot upon My vesture”608
(ver. 18).
20. “But Thou, O Lord, withhold not Thy help far from Me” (ver. 19). But Thou, O
Lord, raise Me up again, not as the rest of men, at the end of the world, but immediately.
“Look to My defence.” “Look,” that they in no wise hurt Me.

Psalm XXII
21. “Deliver My soul from the sword.” “Deliver My soul” from the tongue of dissension.
“And My only One from the hand of the dog” (ver. 20). And from the power of the people,
barking after their custom, deliver My Church.
22. “Save Me from the lion’s mouth:” save Me from the mouth of the kingdom of this
world: “and my humility from the horns of the unicorns”609 (ver. 21). And from the loftiness
of the proud, exalting themselves to special pre-eminence, and enduring no partakers, save
My humility.
23. “I will declare Thy name to My brethren”610 (ver. 22). I will declare Thy name to
the humble,611 and to My Brethren that love one another as they have been beloved by
Me.612 “In the midst of the Church will I sing of Thee.” In the midst of the Church will I
with rejoicing preach Thee.
24. “Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him.” “Ye that fear the Lord,” seek not your own praise,
but “praise Him.” “All ye seed of Jacob, magnify Him” (ver. 23). All ye seed of him whom
the elder shall serve, magnify Him.
25. “Let all the seed of Israel fear Him.” Let all who have been born to a new life, and
restored to the vision of God “fear Him.” “Since He hath not despised, nor disregarded the
prayer of the poor man” (ver. 24). Since He hath not despised the prayer, not of him who,
crying unto God in the words of sins was loath to overpass a vain life, but the prayer of the
poor man, not swollen up with transitory pomps. “Nor hath He turned away His face from
Me.” As from him who said, I will cry unto Thee, but Thou wilt not hear. “And when I cried
unto Him He heard Me.”
26. “With Thee is My praise” (ver. 25). For I seek not Mine own praise,613 for Thou art
My praise, who dwellest in the holy place; and, praise of Israel, Thou hearest The Holy One
now beseeching Thee. “In the great Church I will confess Thee.” In the Church of the whole
world “I will confess Thee.” “I will offer My vows in the sight of them that fear Him.” I will
offer the sacraments of My Body and Blood in the sight of them that fear Him.
27. “The poor shall eat, and be filled” (ver. 26). The humble and the despisers of the
world shall eat, and imitate Me. For so they will neither desire this world’s abundance, nor
fear its want. “And they shall praise the Lord, who seek Him.” For the praise of the Lord is
the pouring out of that fulness. “Their hearts shall live for ever and ever.” For that food is
the food of the heart.

Psalm XXII
28. “All the borders of the earth shall remember themselves, and be turned to the Lord”
(ver. 27). They shall remember themselves: for, by the Gentiles, born in death and bent on
outward things, God had been forgotten; and then shall all the borders of the earth be turned
to the Lord. “And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship in His sight.” And all the
kindreds of the nations shall worship in their own consciences.
29. “For the kingdom is the Lord’s, and He shall rule over the nations” (ver. 28). For
the kingdom is the Lord’s, not proud men’s: and He shall rule over the nations.
30. “All the rich of the earth have eaten, and worshipped”614 (ver. 29). The rich of the
earth too have eaten the Body of their Lord’s humiliation, and though they have not, as the
poor, been filled even to imitation, yet they have worshipped. “In His sight shall fall all that
descend to earth.” For He alone seeth how all they fall, who abandoning a heavenly conver-
sation, make choice, on earth, to appear happy to men, who see not their fall.
31. “And My Soul shall live to Him.” And My Soul, which in the contempt of this world
seems to men as it were to die, shall live, not to itself, but to Him. “And My seed shall serve
Him” (ver. 30). And My deeds, or they who through Me believe on Him, shall serve Him.
32. “The generation to come shall be declared to the Lord” (ver. 31). The generation of
the New Testament shall be declared to the honour of the Lord. “And the heavens shall de-
clare His righteousness.” And the Evangelists shall declare His righteousness. “To a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.” To a people that shall be born to the Lord
through faith.

Psalm XXII
Psalm XXIII.615
A psalm of David himself.
1. The Church speaks to Christ: “The Lord feedeth me, and I shall lack nothing” (ver.
1). The Lord Jesus Christ is my Shepherd, “and I shall lack nothing.”
2. “In a place of pasture there hath He placed me” (ver. 2). In a place of fresh pasture,
leading me to faith,616 there hath He placed me to be nourished. “By the water of refreshing
hath He brought me up.” By the water of baptism, whereby they are refreshed who have
lost health and strength, hath He brought me up.
3. “He hath converted my soul: He hath led me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
His Name’s sake” (ver. 3). He hath brought me forth in the narrow ways, wherein few walk,
of His righteousness; not for my merit’s sake, but for His Name’s sake.
4. “Yea, though I walk in the midst of the shadow of death” (ver. 4). Yea, though I walk
in the midst of this life, which is the shadow of death.617 “I will fear no evil, for Thou art
with me.” I will fear no evil, for Thou dwellest in my heart by faith: and Thou art now with
me, that after the shadow of death I too may be with Thee. “Thy rod and Thy staff, they
have comforted me.” Thy discipline, like a rod for a flock of sheep, and like a staff for children
of some size, and growing out of the natural into spiritual life, they have not been grievous
to me; rather have they comforted me: because Thou art mindful of me.
5. “Thou hast prepared a table in my sight, against them that trouble me” (ver. 5). Now
after the rod, whereby, whilst a little one, and living the natural life, I was brought up among
the flock in the pastures; after that rod, I say, when I began to be under the staff, Thou hast
prepared a table in my sight, that I should no more be fed as a babe with milk,618 but being
older should take meat, strengthened against them that trouble me. “Thou hast fattened my
head with oil.” Thou hast gladdened my mind with spiritual joy. “And Thy inebriating cup,
how excellent is it!” And Thy cup yielding forgetfulness of former vain delights, how excellent
is it!
6. “And Thy mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:” that is, as long as I live in
this mortal life, not Thine, but mine. “That I may dwell in the house of the Lord619 for length
of days” (ver. 6). Now Thy mercy shall follow me not here only, but also that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord for ever.

Psalm XXIII
Psalm XXIII
Psalm XXIV.620
A psalm of David himself, on the first day of the week.621
1. A Psalm of David himself, touching the glorifying and resurrection of the Lord, which
took place early in the morning on the first day of the week, which is now called the Lord’s
Day.
2. “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof, the compass of the world, and all
they that dwell therein” (ver. 1); when the Lord, being glorified, is announced for the believing
of all nations; and the whole compass of the world becomes His Church. “He hath founded
it above the seas.” He hath most firmly established it above all the waves of this world, that
they should be subdued by it, and should not hurt it. “And hath prepared it above the rivers”
(ver. 2). The rivers flow into the sea, and men of lust lapse into the world: these also the
Church, which, when worldly lusts have been conquered by the grace of God, hath been
prepared by love for the reception of immortality, subdues.
3. “Who shall ascend into the mount of the Lord?” Who shall ascend to the height of
the righteousness of the Lord? “Or who shall stand in His holy place?” (ver. 3). Or who shall
abide in that place, whither He shall ascend,622 founded above the seas, and prepared above
the rivers?
4. “The innocent of hand, and the pure in heart” (ver. 4). Who then shall ascend thither,
and abide there, but the guiltless in deed, and pure in thought? “Who hath not received his
soul in vain.” Who hath not reckoned his soul among things that pass away, but feeling it
to be immortal, hath longed for an eternity stedfast and unchangeable. “And hath not sworn
in deceit to his neighbour.” And therefore without deceit, as things eternal are simple and
undeceiving, hath so behaved himself to his neighbour.
5. “This man shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from the God of his salva-
tion”623 (ver. 5).
6. “This is the generation of them that seek the Lord” (ver. 6). For thus are they born
that seek Him. “Of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob.624 Diapsalma.” Now they
seek the face of God, who gave the pre-eminence to the younger born.625
7. “Take away your gates, ye princes” (ver. 7). All ye, that seek rule among men, remove,
that they hinder not, the entrances which ye have made, of desire and fear. “And be ye lift

up, ye everlasting gates.” And be ye lift up, ye entrances of eternal life, of renunciation of
the world, and conversion to God. “And the King of glory shall come in.” And the King, in
whom we may glory without pride, shall come in: who having overcome the gates of death,
and having opened for Himself the heavenly places, fulfilled that which He said, “Be of good
cheer, for I have overcome the world.”626
8. “Who is this King of glory?” Mortal nature is awe-struck in wonder, and asks, “Who
is this King of glory?” “The Lord strong and mighty.” He whom thou didst deem weak and
overwhelmed. “The Lord mighty in battle” (ver. 8). Handle the scars, and thou wilt find
them made whole, and human weakness restored to immortality. The glorifying of the Lord,
which was owing to earth, where It warred with death, hath been paid.
9. “Take away your gates, ye princes.”627 Let us go hence straightway into heaven. Again,
let the Prophet’s trumpet cry aloud, “Take away too, ye princes of the air, the gates, which
ye have in the minds of men who ‘worship the host of heaven.’”628 “And be ye lift up, ye
everlasting gates.” And be ye lift up, ye doors of everlasting righteousness, of love, and
chastity, through which the soul loveth the One True God, and goeth not a-whoring with
the many that are called gods. “And the King of glory shall come in” (ver. 9). “And the King
of glory shall come in,” that He may at the right hand of the Father intercede for us.
10. “Who is this King of glory?” What! dost thou too, prince of the power of this air,629
marvel and ask, “Who is this King of glory?” “The Lord of powers, He is the King of glory”
(ver. 10). Yea, His Body now quickened, He who was tempted marches above thee; He who
was tempted by the angel, the deceiver, goes above all angels. Let none of you put himself
before us and stop our way, that he may be worshipped as a god by us: neither principality,
nor angel, nor power, separateth us from the love of Christ.630 It is good to trust in the Lord,
rather than to trust in a prince;631 that he who glorieth, should glory in the Lord.632 These
indeed are powers in the administration of this world, but “the Lord of powers, He is the
King of glory.”

Psalm XXIV
Psalm XXV.633
To the end, a psalm of David himself.634
1. Christ speaks, but in the person of the Church: for what is said has reference rather
to the Christian People turned unto God.
2. “Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lift up my soul” (ver. 1): with spiritual longing have I lift
up the soul, that was trodden down on the earth with carnal longings. “O my God, in Thee
I trust, I shall not be ashamed” (ver. 2). O my God, from trusting in myself I was brought
even to this weakness of the flesh; and I who on abandoning God wished to be as God,
fearing death from the smallest insect, was in derision ashamed for my pride; now, therefore,
“in Thee I trust, I shall not be ashamed.”
3. “And let not my enemies mock me.” And let them not mock me, who by ensnaring
me with serpent-like and secret suggestions, and prompting me with “Well done, well done,”
have brought me down to this. “For all that wait upon Thee shall not be confounded” (ver.
3).
4. “Let them be confounded who do vain things unrighteously.” Let them be confounded
who act unrighteously for the acquiring things that pass away. “Make Thy ways, O Lord,
known to me, and teach me Thy paths” (ver. 4): not those which are broad, and lead the
many to destruction;635 but Thy paths, narrow, and known to few, teach Thou me.
5. “In Thy truth guide me:” avoiding error. “And teach me:” for by myself I know
nothing, but falsehood. “For Thou art the God of my salvation; and for Thee have I waited
all the day” (ver. 5). For dismissed by Thee from Paradise, and having taken my journey
into a far country,636 I cannot by myself return, unless Thou meetest the wanderer: for my
return hath throughout the whole tract of this world’s time waited for Thy mercy.
6. “Remember Thy compassions, O Lord” (ver. 6). Remember the works of Thy mercy,
O Lord; for men deem of Thee as though Thou hadst forgotten. “And that Thy mercies are
from eternity.” And remember this, that Thy mercies are from eternity. For Thou never
wast without them, who hast subjected even sinful man to vanity indeed, but in hope;637
and not deprived him of so many and great consolations of Thy creation.
7. “Remember not the offences of my youth and of my ignorance” (ver. 7). The offences
of my presumptuous boldness and of my ignorance reserve not for vengeance, but let them
be as if forgotten by Thee. “According to Thy mercy, be mindful of me, O God.” Be mindful
indeed of me, not according to the anger of which I am worthy, but according to Thy mercy

Psalm XXV
Psalm XXV
which is worthy of Thee. “For Thy goodness, O Lord.” Not for my deservings, but for Thy
goodness, O Lord.
8. “Gracious and upright is the Lord” (ver. 8). The Lord is gracious, since even sinners
and the ungodly He so pitied, as to forgive all that is past; but the Lord is upright too, who
after the mercy of vocation and pardon, which is of grace without merit, will require merits
meet for the last judgment. “Wherefore He will establish a law for them that fail in the way.”
For He hath first bestowed mercy to bring them into the way.
9. “He will guide the meek in judgment.” He will guide the meek, and will not confound
in the judgment those that follow His will, and do not, in withstanding It, prefer their own.
“The gentle He will teach His ways” (ver. 9). He will teach His ways, not to those that desire
to run before, as if they were better able to rule themselves; but to those who do not exalt
the neck, nor lift the heel, when the easy yoke and the light burden is laid upon them.638
10. “All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth” (ver. 10). And what ways will He
teach them, but mercy wherein He is placable, and truth wherein He is incorrupt? Whereof
He hath exhibited the one in forgiving sins, the other in judging deserts. And therefore “all
the ways of the Lord” are the two advents of the Son of God, the one in mercy, the other in
judgment. He then attaineth unto Him holding on His ways, who seeing himself freed by
no deserts of his own, lays pride aside, and henceforward bewares of the severity of His trial,
having experienced the clemency of His help. “To them that seek His testament and His
testimonies.” For they understand the Lord as merciful at His first advent, and as the Judge
at His second, who in meekness and gentleness seek His testament, when with His Own
Blood He redeemed us to a new life; and in the Prophets and Evangelists, His testimonies.
11. “For Thy Name’s sake, O Lord, Thou wilt be favourable to my sin; for it is manifold”
(ver. 11). Thou hast not only forgiven my sins, which I committed before I believed; but
also to my sin, which is manifold, since even in the way there is no lack of stumbling, Thou
wilt be made favourable by the sacrifice of a troubled spirit.639
12. “Who is the man that feareth the Lord?” from which fear he begins to come to wis-
dom. “He shall establish a law for him in the way, which he hath chosen” (ver. 12). He shall
establish a law for him in the way, which in his freedom he has taken, that he may not sin
now with impunity.
13. “His soul shall dwell in good, and his seed shall, by inheritance, possess the earth”
(ver. 13). And his work shall possess the stable inheritance of a renewed body.
14. “The Lord is the stay of them that fear Him” (ver. 14). Fear seems to belong to the
weak, but the Lord is the stay of them that fear Him. And the Name of the Lord, which hath
638 Matt. xi. 30.
639 [Here our author, as did St. Chrysostom, treats true contrition as completed by pardon, without sacra-
mental absolution.—C.]
Psalm XXV
been glorified throughout the whole world, is a stay to them that fear Him. “And His testa-
ment, that it may be manifested unto them.” And He maketh His testament to be manifested
unto them, for the Gentiles and the bounds of the earth are Christ’s inheritance.
15. “Mine eyes are ever unto the Lord; for He shall pluck my feet out of the snare” (ver.
15). Nor would I fear the dangers of earth, while I look not upon the earth: for He upon
whom I look, will pluck my feet out of the snare.
16. “Look upon me, and have mercy upon me; for I am single and poor” (ver. 16). For
I am a single people, keeping the lowliness of Thy single Church, which no schisms or her-
esies possess.
17. “The tribulations of my heart have been multiplied” (ver. 17). The tribulations of
my heart have been multiplied by the abounding of iniquity and the waxing cold of love.640
“O bring Thou me out of my necessities.” Since I must needs bear this, that by enduring
unto the end I may be saved, bring Thou me out of my necessities.
18. “See my humility and my travail” (ver. 18). See my humility, whereby I never, in the
boast of righteousness, break off from unity; and my travail, wherein I bear with the unruly
ones that are mingled with me. “And forgive all my sins.” And, propitiated by these sacrifices,
forgive all my sins, not those only of youth and my ignorance before I believed, but those
also which, living now by faith, I commit through infirmity, or the darkness of this life.
19. “Consider mine enemies, how they are multiplied” (ver. 19). For not only without,
but even within, in the Church’s very communion, they are not wanting. “And with an un-
righteous hate they hate me.” And they hate me who love them.
20. “Keep my soul, and deliver me.” Keep my soul, that I turn not aside to imitate them;
and draw me out from the confusion wherein they are mingled with me. “Let me not be
confounded, for I have put my trust in Thee” (ver. 20). Let me not be confounded, if haply
they rise up against me: for not in myself, but in Thee have I put my trust.
21. “The innocent and the upright have cleaved to me, for I have waited for Thee, O
Lord” (ver. 21). The innocent and the upright, not in bodily presence only, as the evil, are
mingled with me, but in the agreement of the heart in the same innocence and uprightness
cleave to me: for I have not fallen away to imitate the evil; but I have waited for Thee, expect-
ing the winnowing of Thy last harvest. 641
22. “Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles” (ver. 22). “Redeem Thy people, O
God,” whom Thou hast prepared to see Thee, out of his troubles, not those only which he
bears without, but those also which he bears within.
640 Matt. xxiv. 12.
641 [So the dying Jacob, Gen. xlix. 18.—C.]
Psalm XXV
Psalm XXVI.642
Of David himself.
1. It may be attributed to David himself, not the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus, but
the whole Church now perfectly established in Christ.
2. “Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence” (ver. 1). Judge me, O Lord,
for, after the mercy which Thou first showedst643 me, I have some desert of my innocence,
the way whereof I have kept. “And trusting in the Lord I shall not be moved.” And yet not
even so trusting in myself, but in the Lord, I shall abide in Him.
3. “Prove me, O Lord, and try me” (ver. 2). Lest, however, any of my secret sins should
be hid from me, prove me, O Lord, and try me, making me known, not to Thee from whom
nothing is hid, but to myself, and to men. “Burn my reins and my heart.” Apply a remedial
purgation, as it were fire, to my pleasures and thoughts. “For Thy mercy is before mine eyes”
(ver. 3). For, that I be not consumed by that fire, not my merits, but Thy mercy, whereby
Thou hast brought me on to such a life, is before my eyes. “And I have been pleasing in Thy
truth.” And since my own falsehood hath been displeasing to me, but Thy truth pleasing, I
have myself been pleasing also with it and in it.
4. “I have not sat with the council of vanity” (ver. 4). I have not chosen to give my heart
to them who endeavour to provide, what is impossible, how they may be blessed in the en-
joyment of things transitory. “And I will not enter in with them that work wickedly.” And
since this is the very cause of all wickedness, therefore I will not have my conscience hid,
with them that work wickedly.
5. “I have hated the congregation of evil doers.” But to arrive at this council of vanity,
congregations of evil doers are formed, which I have hated. “And I will not sit with the un
godly” (ver. 5). And, therefore, with such a council, with the ungodly, I will not sit, that is,
I will not place my consent.644 “And I will not sit with the ungodly.”
6. “I will wash mine hands amid the innocent” (ver. 6). I will make clean my works
among the innocent: among the innocent will I wash mine hands, with which I shall embrace
Thy glorious gifts.645 “And I will compass Thy altar, O Lord.”646
7. “That I may hear the voice of Thy praise.” That I may learn how to praise Thee. “And
that I may declare all Thy wondrous works” (ver. 7). And after I have learnt, I may set forth
all Thy wondrous works.

Psalm XXVI
Psalm XXVI
8. “O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house:” of Thy Church. “And the place of
the habitation of Thy glory” (ver. 8): where Thou dwellest, and art glorified.
9. “Destroy not my soul with the ungodly” (ver. 9). Destroy not then, together with
them that hate Thee, my soul, which hath loved the beauty of Thy house. “And my life with
the men of blood.” And with them that hate their neighbour. For Thy house is beautified
with the two commandments.647
10. “In whose hands is wickedness.” Destroy me not then with the ungodly and the men
of blood, whose works are wicked. “Their right hand is full of gifts” (ver. 10). And that which
was given them to obtain eternal salvation, they have converted into the receiving this world’s
gifts, “supposing that godliness is a trade.”648
11. “But I have walked in mine innocence: deliver me, and have mercy on me” (ver. 11).
Let so great a price of my Lord’s Blood avail for my complete deliverance: and in the dangers
of this life let not Thy mercy leave me.
12. “My foot hath stood in uprightness.” My Love hath not withdrawn from Thy right-
eousness. “In the Churches I will bless Thee, O Lord” (ver. 12). I will not hide Thy blessing,
O Lord, from those whom Thou hast called; for next to the love of Thee I join the love of
my neighbour.
647 [Matt. xxii. 40.—C.]
648 1 Tim. vi. 5.
Psalm XXVI
Psalm XXVII.649
Of David himself, before he was anointed.650
1. Christ’s young soldier speaketh, on his coming to the faith. “The Lord is my light,
and my salvation: whom shall I fear?” (ver. 1). The Lord will give me both knowledge of
Himself, and salvation: who shall take me from Him? “The Lord is the Protector of my life:
of whom shall I be afraid?” The Lord will repel all the assaults and snares of mine enemy:
of no man shall I be afraid.
2. “Whilst the guilty approach unto me to eat up my flesh” (ver. 2). Whilst the guilty
come near to recognise and insult me, that they may exalt themselves above me in my change
for the better; that with their reviling tooth they may consume not me, but rather my fleshly
desires. “Mine enemies who trouble me.” Not they only who trouble me, blaming me with
a friendly intent, and wishing to recall me from my purpose, but mine enemies also. “They
became weak, and fell.”651 Whilst then they do this with the desire of defending their own
opinion, they became weak to believe better things, and began to hate the word of salvation,
whereby I do what displeases them.
3. “If camps stand together against me, my heart will not fear.” But if the multitude of
gain-sayers conspire to stand together against me, my heart will not fear, so as to go over
to their side. “If war rise up against me, in this will I trust” (ver. 3). If the persecution of this
world arise against me, in this petition, which I am pondering, will I place my hope.
4. “One have I asked of the Lord, this will I require.” For one petition have I asked the
Lord, this will I require. “That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life”
(ver. 4). That as long as I am in this life, no adversities may exclude me from the number
of them who hold the unity and the truth of the Lord’s faith throughout the world. “That I
may contemplate the delight of the Lord.” With this end, namely, that persevering in the
faith, the delightsome vision may appear to me, which I may contemplate face to face. “And
I shall be protected, His temple.” And death being swallowed up in victory, I shall be clothed
with immortality, being made His temple.652
5. “For He hath hidden me in His tabernacle in the day of my evils” (ver. 5). For He
hath hidden me in the dispensation of His Incarnate Word in the time of temptations, to
649 Lat. XXVI.

Psalm XXVII
Psalm XXVII
which my mortal life is exposed. “He hath protected me in the secret place of His tabernacle.”
He hath protected me, with the heart believing unto righteousness.
6. “On a rock hath He exalted me.” And that what I believed might be made manifest
for salvation, He hath made my confession to be conspicuous in His own strength. “And
now, lo! He hath exalted mine head above mine enemies” (ver. 6). What doth He reserve
for me at the last, when even now the body is dead because of sin, lo! I feel that my mind
serves the law of God, and is not led captive under the rebellious law of sin? “I have gone
about, and have sacrificed in His tabernacle the sacrifice of rejoicing.” I have considered the
circuit of the world, believing on Christ; and in that for us God was humbled in time, I have
praised Him with rejoicing: for with such sacrifice He is well pleased. “I will sing and give
praises to the Lord.” In heart and in deed I will be glad in the Lord.
7. “Hear my voice, O Lord, wherewith I have cried unto Thee” (ver. 7). Hear, Lord, my
interior voice, which with a strong intention I have addressed to Thy ears. “Have mercy
upon me, and hear me.” Have mercy upon me, and hear me therein.
8. “My heart hath said to Thee, I have sought Thy countenance” (ver. 8). For I have not
exhibited myself to men; but in secret, where Thou alone hearest, my heart hath said to
Thee; I have not sought from Thee aught without Thee as a reward, but Thy countenance.
“Thy countenance, O Lord, will I seek.” In thus search will I perseveringly persist: for not
aught that is common, but Thy countenance, O Lord, will I seek, that I may love Thee freely,
since nothing more precious do I find.
9. “Turn not away Thy face from me” (ver. 9): that I may find what I seek. “Turn not
aside in anger from Thy servant:” lest, while seeking Thee, I fall in with somewhat else. For
what is more grievous than this punishment to one who loveth and seeketh the truth of Thy
countenance? “Be Thou my Helper.” How shall I find it, if Thou help me not? “Leave me
not, neither despise me, O God my Saviour.” Scorn not that a mortal dares to seek the
Eternal; for Thou, God, dost heal the wound of my sin.
10. “For my father and my mother have left me” (ver. 10). For the kingdom of this world
and the city of this world, of which I was born in time and mortality, have left me seeking
Thee, and despising what they promised, since they could not give what I seek. “But the
Lord took me up.” But the Lord, who can give me Himself, took me up.
11. “Appoint me a law, O Lord, in Thy way” (ver. 11). For me then who am setting out
toward Thee, and commenting so great a profession, of arriving at wisdom, from fear, ap-
point, O Lord, a law in Thy way, lest in my wandering Thy rule abandon me. “And direct
me in the right path because of mine enemies.” And direct me in the right way of its straits.
For it is not enough to begin, since enemies cease not until the end is attained.
12. “Deliver me not up unto the souls of them that trouble me” (ver. 12). Suffer not
them that trouble me to be satiated with my evils. “For unrighteous witnesses have risen up
against me.” For there have risen up against me they that speak falsely of me, to remove and
Psalm XXVII
call me back from Thee, as if I seek glory of men. “And iniquity hath lied unto itself.”
Therefore iniquity hath been pleased with its own lie. For me it hath not moved, to whom
because of this there hath been promised a greater reward in heaven.
13. “I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living” (ver. 13). And
since my Lord hath first suffered these things, if I too despise the tongues of the dying (“for
the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul”653), I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the
land of the living, where there is no place for falsity.
14. “Wait on the Lord, quit thyself like a man: and let thy heart be strong, yea wait on
the Lord” (ver. 14). But when shall this be? It is arduous for a mortal, it is slow to a lover:
but listen to the voice, that deceiveth not, of him that saith, “Wait on the Lord.” Endure the
burning of the reins manfully, and the burning of the heart stoutly. Think not that what
thou dost not as yet receive is denied thee. That thou faint not in despair, see how it is said,
“Wait on the Lord.”654

Psalm XXVII
Psalm XXVIII.655
Of David himself.
1. It is the Voice of the Mediator Himself, strong of hand in the conflict of the Passion.
Now what He seems to wish for against His enemies, is not the wish of malevolence, but
the declaration of their punishment; as in the Gospel,656 with the cities, in which though
He had performed miracles, yet they had not believed on Him, He doth not wish in any evil
will what He saith, but predicteth what is impending over them.
2. “Unto Thee, O Lord, have I cried;657 My God, be not silent from me” (ver. 1). Unto
Thee, O Lord, have I cried; My God, separate not the unity of Thy Word from that which
as Man I am. “Lest at any time Thou be silent from me: and I shall be like them that go down
into the pit.” For from this, that the Eternity of Thy Word ceaseth not to unite Itself to Me,
it comes that I am not such a man as the rest of men, who are born into the deep misery of
this world: where, as if Thou art silent, Thy Word is not recognised. “Hear, O Lord, the
voice of my supplication, whist I pray unto Thee, whilst I hold up my hands to Thy holy
temple” (ver. 2). Whilst I am crucified for their salvation, who on believing become Thy
holy temple.
3. “Draw not My Soul away with sinners, and destroy me not with them that work
iniquity, with them that speak peace with their neighbours” (ver. 3). With them that say
unto Me, “We know that Thou art a Master come from God.”658 “But evil in their hearts.”
But they speak evil in their hearts.
4. “Give unto them according to their works” (ver. 4). Give unto them according to their
works, for this is just. “And according to the malice of their affections.”659 For aiming at
evil, they cannot discover good. “According to the works of their hands give Thou unto
them.” Although what they have done may avail for salvation to others, yet give Thou unto
them according to the works of their wills. “Pay them their recompense.” Because, for the
truth which they heard, they wished to recompense deceit; let their own deceit deceive them.
5. “For they have not had understanding in the works of the Lord” (ver. 5). And whence
is it clear that this hath befallen them? From this forsooth, “for they have not had under-
standing in the works of the Lord.” This very thing, in truth, hath been, even now, their re-
compense, that in Him whom they tempted with malicious intent as a Man, they should
not recognise God, with what design the Father sent Him in the Flesh. “And the works of

His hands.” Nor be moved by those visible works, which are laid out before their very eyes.
“Thou shalt destroy them, and not build them up.” Let them do Me no hurt, nay, nor again
in their endeavour to raise engines against My Church, let them aught avail.
6. “Blessed be the Lord, for He hath heard the voice of My prayer” (ver. 6).
7. “The Lord My Helper and My Protector” (ver. 7). The Lord helping Me in so great
sufferings, and protecting Me with immortality in My resurrection. “In Him hath My Heart
trusted, and I have been helped.” “And My Flesh hath flourished again:” that is, and My
Flesh hath risen again. “And of my will I will confess unto Him.” Wherefore, the fear of
death being now destroyed, not by the necessity of fear under the Law, but with a free will
with the Law, shall they who believe on Me, confess unto Him; and because I am in them,
I will confess.
8. “The Lord is the strength of His people” (ver. 8). Not that people “ignorant of the
righteousness of God, and willing to establish their own.”660 For they thought not themselves
strong in themselves: for the Lord is the strength of His people, struggling in this life’s diffi-
culties with the devil. “And the protector of the salvation of His Christ.” That, having saved
them by His Christ after the strength of war, He may protect them at the last with the im-
mortality of peace.
9. “Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance” (ver. 9). I intercede therefore, after
My Flesh hath flourished again, because Thou hast said, “Desire of Me, and I will give Thee
the heathen for Thine inheritance;”661 “Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance:” for
“all Mine are Thine.”662 “And rule them, and set them up even for ever.” And rule them in
this temporal life, and raise them from hence into life eternal.

Psalm XXVIII
Psalm XXIX.663
A psalm of David himself, of the consummation of the tabernacle.
1. A Psalm of the Mediator Himself, strong of hand, of the perfection of the Church in
this world, where she wars in time against the devil.
2. The Prophet speaks, “Bring unto the Lord, O ye Sons of God, bring unto the Lord
the young of rams” (ver. 1). Bring unto the Lord yourselves, whom the Apostles, the leaders
of the flocks, have begotten by the Gospel.664 “Bring unto the Lord glory and honour” (ver.
2). By your works let the Lord be glorified and honoured. “Bring unto the Lord glory to His
name.” Let Him be made known gloriously throughout the world. “Worship the Lord in
His holy court.” Worship the Lord in your heart enlarged and sanctified. For ye are His
regal holy habitation.
3. “The Voice of the Lord is upon the waters” (ver. 3). The Voice of Christ is upon the
peoples. “The God of majesty hath thundered.” The God of majesty, from the cloud of the
flesh, hath awfully preached repentance. “The Lord is upon many waters.” The Lord Jesus
Himself, after that He sent forth His Voice upon the peoples, and struck them with awe,
converted them to Himself, and dwelt in them.
4. “The Voice of the Lord is in power” (ver. 4). The Voice of the Lord now in them
themselves, making them powerful. “The Voice of the Lord is in great might.” The Voice
of the Lord working great things in them.
5. “The Voice of the Lord breaking the cedars” (ver. 5). The Voice of the Lord humbling
the proud in brokenness of heart. “The Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus.” The Lord
by repentance shall break them that are lifted on high by the splendour of earthly nobility,
when to confound them He shall have “chosen the base things of this world,”665 in the which
to display His Divinity.
6. “And shall bruise them as the calf of Libanus” (ver. 6). And when their proud exaltation
hath been cut off, He will lay them low after the imitation of His Own humility, who like a
calf was led to slaughter666 by the nobility of this world. “For the kings of the earth stood
up, and the rulers agreed together against the Lord, and against His Christ.”667 “And the
Beloved is as the young of the unicorns.” For even He the Beloved, and the Only One of the
Father, “emptied Himself” of His glory; and was made man,668 like a child of the Jews, that

were “ignorant of God’s righteousness,”669 and proudly boasting of their own righteousness
as peculiarly theirs.
7. “The Voice of the Lord cutting short the flame of fire” (ver. 7). The Voice of the Lord,
without any harm to Himself, passing through all the excited ardour of them that persecute
Him, or dividing the furious rage of His persecutors, so that some should say, “Is not this
haply the very Christ;” others, “Nay; but He deceiveth the people:”670 and so cutting short
their mad tumult, as to pass some over into His love, and leave others in their malice.
8. “The Voice of the Lord moving the wilderness” (ver. 8). The Voice of the Lord moving
to the faith the Gentiles once “without hope, and without God in the world;”671 where no
prophet, no preacher of God’s word, as it were, no man had dwelt. “And the Lord will move
the desert of Cades.” And then the Lord will cause the holy word of His Scriptures to be
fully known, which was abandoned by the Jews who understood it not.
9. “The Voice of the Lord perfecting the stags”672 (ver. 9). For the Voice of the Lord
hath first perfected them that overcame and repelled the envenomed tongues.673 “And will
reveal the woods.” And then will He reveal to them the darknesses of the Divine books, and
the shadowy depths of the mysteries, where they feed with freedom. “And in His temple
doth every man speak of His glory.” And in His Church all born again to an eternal hope
praise God, each for His own gift, which He hath received from the Holy Spirit.
10. “The Lord inhabiteth the deluge” (ver. 10). The Lord therefore first inhabiteth the
deluge of this world in His Saints, kept safely in the Church, as in the ark. “And the Lord
shall sit a King for ever.” And afterward He will sit reigning in them for ever.
11. “The Lord will give strength to His people”674 (ver. 11). For the Lord will give strength
to His people fighting against the storms and whirlwinds of this world, for peace in this
world He hath not promised them.675 “The Lord will bless His people in peace.” And the
same Lord will bless His people, affording them peace in Himself; for, saith He, “My peace
I give unto you, My peace I leave with you.”676

Psalm XXIX
Psalm XXX.677
To the end, the psalm of the canticle678 of the dedication of the house, of David himself.
1. To the end, a Psalm of the joy of the Resurrection, and the change, the renewing of
the body to an immortal state, and not only of the Lord, but also of the whole Church. For
in the former Psalm the tabernacle was finished, wherein we dwell in the time of war: but
now the house is dedicated, which will abide in peace everlasting.
2. It is then whole Christ who speaketh. “I will exalt Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast taken
Me up” (ver. 1). I will praise Thy high Majesty, O Lord, for Thou hast taken Me up. “Thou
hast not made Mine enemies to rejoice over Me.” And those, who have so often endeavoured
to oppress Me with various persecutions throughout the world, Thou hast not made to rejoice
over Me.
3. “O Lord, My God, I have cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed Me” (ver. 2). O Lord,
My God, I have cried unto Thee, and I no longer bear about a body enfeebled and sick by
mortality.
4. “O Lord, Thou hast brought back My Soul from hell, and Thou hast saved Me from
them that go down into the pit” (ver. 3). Thou hast saved Me from the condition of profound
darkness, and the lowest slough of corruptible flesh.
5. “Sing to the Lord, O ye saints of His.” The prophet seeing these future things, rejoiceth,
and saith, “Sing to the Lord, O ye saints of His. And make confession of the remembrance
of His holiness” (ver. 4). And make confession to Him, that He hath not forgotten the
sanctification, wherewith He hath sanctified you, although all this intermediate period belong
to your desires.
6. “For in His indignation is wrath” (ver. 5). For He hath avenged against you the first
sin, for which you have paid by death. “And life in His will.” And life eternal, whereunto
you could not return by any strength of your own, hath He given, because He so would. “In
the evening weeping will tarry.” Evening began, when the light of wisdom withdrew from
sinful man, when he was condemned to death: from this evening weeping will tarry, as long
as God’s people are, amid labours and temptations, awaiting the day of the Lord. “And ex-
ultation in the morning.” Even to the morning, when there will be the exultation of the re-
surrection, which hath shone forth by anticipation in the morning resurrection of the Lord.
7. “But I said in my abundance, I shall not be moved for ever” (ver. 6). But I, that people
which was speaking from the first, said in mine abundance, suffering now no more any
want, “I shall not be moved for ever.”

8. “O Lord, in Thy will Thou hast afforded strength unto my beauty” (ver. 7). But that
this my abundance, O Lord, is not of myself, but that in Thy will Thou hast afforded strength
unto my beauty, I have learnt from this, “Thou turnedst away Thy Face from me, and I be-
came troubled;” for Thou hast sometimes turned away Thy Face from the sinner, and I be-
came troubled, when the illumination of Thy knowledge withdrew from me.
9. “Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and unto my God will I pray” (ver. 8). And bringing
to mind that time of my trouble and misery, and as it were established therein, I hear the
voice of Thy First-Begotten, my Head, about to die for me, and saying “Unto Thee, O Lord,
will I cry, and unto My God will I pray.”
10. “What profit” is there in the shedding of My blood, whilst I go down to corruption?
“Shall dust confess unto Thee?” For if I shall not rise immediately, and My body shall become
corrupt, “shall dust confess unto Thee?” that is, the crowd of the ungodly, whom I shall
justify by My resurrection? “Or declare Thy truth?” Or for the salvation of the rest declare
Thy truth?
11. “The Lord hath heard, and had mercy on Me, the Lord hath become My helper.”
Nor did “He suffer His holy One to see corruption”679 (ver. 10).
12. “Thou hast turned My mourning into joy to Me” (ver. 11). Whom I, the Church,
having received, the First-Begotten from the dead,680 now in the dedication of Thine house,
say, “Thou hast turned my mourning into joy to me. Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.” Thou hast torn off the veil of my sins, the sadness of my mortality;
and hast girded me with the first robe, with immortal gladness.
13. “That my glory should sing unto Thee, and I should not be pricked” (ver. 12). That
now, not my humiliation, but my glory should not lament, but should sing unto Thee, for
that now out of humiliation Thou hast exalted me; and that I should not be pricked with
the consciousness of sin, with the fear of death, with the fear of judgment. “O Lord, my God,
I will confess unto Thee for ever.” And this is my glory, O Lord, my God, that I should
confess unto Thee for ever, that I have nothing of myself, but that all my good is of Thee,
who art “God, All in all.”681

Psalm XXX
Psalm XXXI.682
To the end, a psalm of David himself, an ecstasy.683
1. To the end a Psalm of David Himself, the Mediator strong of hand in persecutions.
For the word ecstasy, which is added to the title, signifies a transport of the mind, which is
produced either by a panic, or by some revelation. But in this Psalm the panic of the people
of God troubled by the persecution of all the heathen, and by the failing of faith throughout
the world, is principally seen. But first the Mediator Himself speaks: then the People redeemed
by His Blood gives thanks: at last in trouble it speaks at length, which is what belongs to the
ecstasy; but the Person of the Prophet himself is twice interposed, near the end, and at the
end.
2. “In Thee, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me not be put to confusion for ever” (ver. 1). In
Thee, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me never be confounded, whilst they shall insult Me as one
like other men. “In Thy righteousness rescue Me, and deliver Me.” And in Thy righteousness
rescue Me from the pit of death, and deliver Me out of their company.
3. “Bend down Thine ear unto Me” (ver. 2). Hear Me in My humiliation, nigh at hand
unto Me. “Make haste to deliver Me.” Defer not to the end of the world, as with all who
believe on Me, My separation from sinners. “Be unto Me a God who protecteth Me.” Be
unto Me God, and Protector. “And a house of refuge, that Thou mayest save Me.” And as
a house, wherein taking refuge I may be saved.
4. “For Thou art My strength, and My refuge” (ver. 3). For Thou art unto Me My strength
to bear My persecutors, and My refuge to escape them. “And for Thy Name’s sake Thou
shalt be My guide, and shalt nourish Me.” And that by Me Thou mayest be known to all the
Gentiles. I will in all things follow Thy will; and, by assembling, by degrees, Saints unto Me,
Thou shalt fulfil My body, and My perfect stature.
5. “Thou shalt bring Me out of this trap, which they have hidden for Me” (ver. 4). Thou
shalt bring Me out of these snares, which they have hidden for Me. “For Thou art My Pro-
tector.”
6. “Into Thy hands I commend My Spirit” (ver. 5). To Thy power I commend My
Spirit, soon to receive It back. “Thou hast redeemed Me, O Lord God of truth.” Let the
people too, redeemed by the Passion of their Lord, and joyful in the glorifying of their Head,
say, “Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.”
7. “Thou hatest them that hold to vanity uselessly” (ver. 6). Thou hatest them that hold
to the false happiness of the world. “But I have trusted in the Lord.”
8. “I will be glad, and rejoice in Thy mercy:” which doth not deceive me. “For Thou hast
regarded My humiliation:” wherein Thou hast subjected me to vanity in hope.684 “Thou

684 Rom. viii. 20.
Psalm XXXI
Psalm XXXI
hast saved my soul from necessities” (ver. 7). Thou hast saved my soul from the necessities
of fear, that with a free love it may serve Thee.
9. “And hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy” (ver. 8). And hast not shut
me up, that I should have no opening for recovering unto liberty, and be given over for ever
into the power of the devil, ensnaring me with the desire of this life, and terrifying me with
death. “Thou hast set my feet in a large room.” The resurrection of my Lord being known,
and mine own being promised me, my love, having been brought out of the straits of fear,
walks abroad in continuance, into the expanse of liberty.
10. “Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am troubled” (ver. 9). But what is this unlooked-
for cruelty of the persecutors, striking such dread into me? “Have mercy on me, O Lord.”
For I am now no more alarmed for death, but for torments and tortures. “Mine eye hath
been disordered by anger.” I had mine eye upon Thee, that Thou shouldest not abandon
me: Thou art angry, and hast disordered it. “My soul, and my belly.” By the same anger my
soul hath been disturbed, and my memory, whereby I retained what my God hath suffered
for me, and what He hath promised me.
11. “For my life hath failed in pain” (ver 10). For my life is to confess Thee, but it failed
in pain, when the enemy had said, Let them be tortured until they deny Him. “And my years
in groanings.” The time that I pass in this world is not taken away from me by death, but
abides, and is spent in groanings. “My strength hath been weakened by want.” I want the
health of this body, and racking pains come on me: I want the dissolution of the body, and
death forbears to come: and in this want my confidence hath been weakened. “And my
bones have been disturbed.” And my stedfastness hath been disturbed.
12. “I have been made a reproach above all mine enemies” (ver 11). All the wicked are
my enemies; and nevertheless they for their wickednesses are tortured only till they confess:
I then have overpassed their reproach, I, whose confession death doth not follow, but racking
pains follow upon it. “And to my neighbours too much.” This hath seemed too much to
them, who were already drawing near to know Thee, and to hold the faith that I hold. “And
a fear to mine acquaintance.” And into my very acquaintance I struck fear by the example
of my dreadful tribulation. “They that did see me, fled without from me.” Because they did
not understand my inward and invisible hope, they fled from me into things outward and
visible.
13. “I have been forgotten, as one dead from the heart” (ver. 12). And they have forgotten
me, as if I were dead from their hearts. “I have become as a lost vessel.” I have seemed to
myself to be lost to all the Lord’s service, living in this world, and gaining none, when all
were afraid to join themselves unto me.
14. “For I have heard the rebuking of many dwelling by in a circuit” (ver. 13). For I have
heard many rebuking me, in the pilgrimage of this world near me, following the circuit of
time, and refusing to return with me to the eternal country. “Whilst they were assembling
Psalm XXXI
themselves together against me, they conspired that they might take my soul.” That my soul,
which should by death easily escape from their power, might consent unto them, they ima-
gined a device, whereby they would not suffer me even to die.
15. “But I have hoped in Thee, O Lord; I have said, Thou art my God” (ver. 14). For
Thou hast not changed, that Thou shouldest not save, Who dost correct.
16. “In Thy hands” are “my lots” (ver. 15). In Thy power are my lots. For I see no desert
for which out of the universal ungodliness of the human race Thou hast elected me particu-
larly to salvation. And though there be with Thee some just and secret order in my election,
yet I, from whom this is hid, have attained by lot unto my Lord’s vesture.685 “Deliver me
from the hands of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.”
17. “Make Thy Face to shine upon Thy servant” (ver. 16). Make it known to men, who
do not think that I belong unto Thee, that Thy Face is bent upon me, and that I serve Thee.
“Save me in Thy mercy.”
18. “O Lord, let me not be confounded, for I have called upon Thee” (ver. 17). O Lord,
let me not be put to shame by those who insult me, for that I have called upon Thee. “Let
the ungodly be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.” Let them rather who call upon
stones be ashamed, and made to dwell with darkness.686
19. “Let the deceitful lips be made dumb” (ver. 18). In making known to the peoples
Thy mysteries wrought in me, strike with dumb amazement the lips of them that invent
falsehood of me. “Which speak iniquity against the Righteous, in pride and contempt.”
Which speak iniquity against Christ, in their pride and contempt of Him as a crucified man.
20. “How great” is “the multitude of Thy sweetness, O Lord” (ver. 19). Here the
Prophet exclaims, having sight of all this, and admiring how manifoldly plenteous is Thy
sweetness, O Lord. “Which Thou hast hid for them that fear Thee.” Even those, whom Thou
correctest, Thou lovest much: but lest they should go on negligently from relaxed security,
Thou hidest from them the sweetness of Thy love, for whom it is profitable to fear Thee.
“Thou hast perfected it for them that hope in Thee.” But Thou hast perfected this sweetness
for them that hope in Thee. For Thou dost not withdraw from them what they look for
perseveringly even unto the end. “In sight of the sons of men.” For it does not escape the
notice of the sons of men, who now live no more after Adam, but after the Son of Man.
“Thou wilt hide them in the hidden place of Thy Countenance:” which seat Thou shalt
preserve for everlasting in the hidden place of the knowledge of Thee for them that hope in
Thee. “From the troubling of men.” So that now they suffer no more trouble from men.
21. “Thou wilt protect them in Thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues” (ver.
20). But here meanwhile whilst evil tongues murmur against them, saying, Who hath come
685 John xix. 24.
686 Umbris socientur.
Psalm XXXI
thence? Thou wilt protect them in the tabernacle, that of faith in those things, which the
Lord wrought and endured for us in time.
22. “Blessed be the Lord; for He hath made His mercy marvellous, in the city of com-
passing” (ver. 21). Blessed be the Lord, for after the correction of the sharpest persecutions
He hath made His mercy marvellous to all throughout the world, in the circuit of human
society.687
23. “I said in my ecstasy”688 (ver. 22). Whence that people again speaking saith, I said
in my fear, when the heathen were raging horribly against me. “I have been cast forth from
the sight of Thine eyes.” For if Thou hadst regard to me, Thou wouldest not suffer me to
endure these things. “Therefore Thou heardest, O Lord, the voice of my prayer, when I cried
unto Thee.” Therefore putting a limit to correction, and showing that I have part in Thy
care, Thou heardest, O Lord, the voice of my prayer, when I raised it high689 out of tribula-
tion.
24. “Love the Lord, all ye His saints” (ver. 23). The Prophet again exhorts, having sight
of these things, and saith, “Love the Lord, all ye His saints; for the Lord will require truth.”
Since “if the righteous shall scarcely be saved, where shall the sinner and the ungodly ap-
pear?”690 “And He will repay them that do exceeding proudly.” And He will repay them
who even when conquered are not converted, because they are very proud.
25. “Quit you like men, and let your heart be strengthened” (ver. 24): working good
without fainting, that ye may reap in due season. “All ye who trust in the Lord:” that is, ye
who duly fear and worship Him, trust ye in the Lord.

Psalm XXXI
Psalm XXXII.691
To David himself; for understanding.
1. To David himself; for understanding; by which it is understood that not by the merits
of works, but by the grace of God, man is delivered, confessing his sins.
2. “Blessed are they whose unrighteousness is forgiven, and whose sins are covered”
(ver. 1): and whose sins are buried in oblivion. “Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath
not imputed sin, nor is there guile in his mouth” (ver. 2): nor has he in his mouth boastings
of righteousness, when his conscience is full of sins.
3. “Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old:” because I made not with my mouth
“confession unto salvation,”692 all firmness in me has grown old in infirmity. “Through my
roaring all the day long” (ver. 3): when I was ungodly and a blasphemer, crying against God,
as though defending and excusing my sins.
4. “Because day and night Thy Hand was heavy upon me:” because, through the con-
tinual punishment of Thy scourges, “I was turned in misery, while a thorn was fixed through
me” (ver. 4): I was made miserable by knowing my misery, being pricked with an evil con-
science.
5. “I acknowledged my sin, and my unrighteousness have I not hid:” that is, my unright-
eousness have I not concealed.693 “I said, I will confess against myself my unrighteousness
to the Lord:” I said, I will confess, not against God (as in my ungodly crying, when I kept
silence), but against myself, my unrighteousness to the Lord. “And Thou forgavest the
iniquity of my heart” (ver. 5); hearing the word of confession in the heart, before it was
uttered with the voice.
6. “For this shall every one that is holy pray unto Thee in an acceptable time:” for this
wickedness of heart shall every one that is righteous pray unto Thee. For not by their own
merits will they be holy, but by that acceptable time, that is, at His coming, who redeemed
us from sin. “Nevertheless in the flood of great waters they shall not come nigh him” (ver.
6): nevertheless, let none think, when the end has come suddenly, as in the days of Noah,694
that there remaineth a place of confession, whereby he may draw nigh unto God.
7. “Thou art my refuge from the pressures, which have compassed me about:” Thou art
my refuge from the pressure of my sins, which hath compassed my heart. “O Thou, my
Rejoicing, deliver me from them that compass me about” (ver. 7): in Thee is my joy: deliver
me from the sorrow which my sins bring upon me.

Psalm XXXII
Psalm XXXII
8. Diapsalma. The answer of God: “I will give thee understanding, and will set thee in
the way in which thou shalt go;” I will give thee understanding after confession, that thou
depart not from the way in which thou shouldest go; lest thou wish to be in thine own power.
“I will fix Mine Eyes upon thee” (ver. 8); so will make sure upon thee My Love.
9. “Be not ye like unto horse or mule, which have no understanding:” and therefore
would govern themselves. But saith the Prophet, “Hold in their jaws with bit and bridle.”
Do Thou then, O God, unto them “that will not come nigh Thee” (ver. 9), what man doth
to horse and mule, that by scourges Thou make them to bear Thy rule.
10. “Many are the scourges of the sinner:” much is he scourged, who, confessing not
his sins to God, would be his own ruler. “But he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy compasseth
him about” (ver. 10); but he that trusteth in the Lord, and submitteth himself to His rule,
mercy shall compass him about.
11. “Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous:” be glad, and rejoice, ye righteous,
not in yourselves, but in the Lord. “And glory, all ye that are right in heart” (ver. 11): and
glory in Him, all ye who understand that it is right to be subject unto Him, that so ye may
be placed above all things beside.
Psalm XXXII
Psalm XXXIII.695
1. “Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous:” rejoice, O ye righteous, not in yourselves, for
that is not safe; but in the Lord. “For praise is comely to the upright” (ver. 1): these praise
the Lord, who submit themselves unto the Lord; for else they are distorted and perverse.
2. “Praise the Lord with harp:” praise the Lord, presenting unto Him your bodies a living
sacrifice.696 “Sing unto Him with the psaltery for ten strings” (ver. 2): let your members be
servants to the love of God, and of your neighbour, in which are kept both the three and
the seven commandments.697
3. “Sing unto Him a new song:” sing unto Him a song of the grace of faith. “Sing skilfully
unto Him with jubilation” (ver. 3): sing skillfully unto Him with rejoicing.
4. “For the Word of the Lord is right:” for the Word of the Lord is right, to make you
that which of yourselves ye cannot be. “And all His works are done in faith” (ver. 4): lest
any think that by the merit of works he hath arrived at faith, when in faith are done all the
works which God Himself loveth.
5. “He loveth Mercy and Judgment:” for He loveth Mercy, which now He showeth first;
and Judgment, wherewith He exacteth that which He hath first shown. “The earth is full of
the Mercy of the Lord” (ver. 5): throughout the whole world are sins forgiven unto men by
the Mercy of the Lord.
6. “By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made firm:” for not by themselves, but
by the Word of the Lord were the righteous made strong. “And all the strength698 of them
by the Breath of His Mouth” (ver. 6). And all their faith by His Holy Spirit.
7. “He gathereth the waters of the sea together as into a bottle:” He gathered the people
of the world together, to confession of mortified sin, lest through pride they flow too freely.
“He layeth up the deep in storehouses” (ver. 7): and keepeth in them His secrets for riches.
8. “Let all the earth fear the Lord:” let every sinner fear, that so he may cease to sin. “Let
all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him” (ver. 8): not of the terrors of men, or
of any creature, but of Him let them stand in awe.
9. “For He spake, and they were made:” for no other one made those things which are
to fear; but He spake, and they were made. “He commanded, and they were created” (ver.
9): He commanded by His Word,699 and they were created.

10. “The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought;” of them that seek not His
Kingdom, but kingdoms of their own. “He maketh the devices of the people of none effect:”
of them that covet earthly happiness. “And reproveth the counsels of princes” (ver. 10): of
them that seek to rule over such peoples.
11. “But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever;” but the counsel of the Lord, whereby
He maketh none blessed but him that submitteth unto Himself, standeth for ever. The
thoughts of His Heart to all generations” (ver. 11): the thoughts of His Wisdom are not
mutable, but endure to all generations.
12. “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord:” one nation is blessed, belonging to
the heavenly city, which hath not chosen save the Lord for their God: “And the people whom
He hath chosen for His own inheritance” (ver. 12): and which not of itself, but by the gift
of God, hath been chosen, that He by possessing it may not suffer it to be uncared for and
miserable.
13. “The Lord looketh from Heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men” (ver. 13). From
the souls of the righteous, the Lord looketh mercifully upon all who would rise to newness
of life.
14. “From His prepared habitation:” from His habitation of assumed Humanity, which
He prepared for Himself. “He looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth” (ver. 14): He
looketh mercifully upon all who live in the flesh, that He may be over them in ruling them.
15. “He fashioneth their hearts singly:” He giveth spiritually to their hearts their proper
gifts, so that neither the whole body may be eye, nor the whole hearing;700 but that one in
this manner, another in that manner, may be incorporated with Christ. “He understandeth
all their works” (ver. 15). Before Him are all their works understood.
16. “A king shall not be saved by much strength:” he shall not be saved who ruleth his
own flesh, if he presume much upon his own strength. “Neither shall a giant be saved by
much strength” (ver. 16): nor shall he be saved whoever warreth against the habit of his own
lust, or against the devil and his angels, if he trust much to his own might.
17. “A horse is a deceitful thing for safety:” he is deceived, who thinketh either that
through men he gaineth salvation received among men, or that by the impetuosity of his
own courage he is defended from destruction. “In the abundance of his strength shall he
not be saved” (ver. 17).
18. “Behold, the Eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear Him:” because if thou seek
salvation, behold, the love of the Lord is upon them that fear Him. “Upon them that hope
in His mercy” (ver. 18): that hope not in their own strength, but in His mercy.
19. “To deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive in famine” (ver. 19). To
give them the nourishment of the Word, and of Everlasting Truth, which they lost while
700 1 Cor. xii. 17.
Psalm XXXIII
presuming on their own strength, and therefore have not even their own strength, from
lack of righteousness.
20. “My soul shall be patient for the Lord:” that hereafter it may be filled with dainties
incorruptible, meanwhile, whilst here it remaineth, my soul shall be patient for the Lord.
“For He is our Helper and Defender” (ver. 20): our Helper He is, while we endeavour after
Him; and our Defender, while we resist the adversary.
21. “For our heart shall rejoice in Him:” for not in ourselves, wherein without Him there
is great need; but in Himself shall our heart rejoice. “And we have trusted in His holy Name”
(ver. 21); and therefore have we trusted that we shall come to God, because unto us absent
hath He sent, through faith, His own Name.
22. “Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in Thee” (ver. 22):
let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; for hope confoundeth not, because we have hoped in
Thee.
Psalm XXXIII
Psalm XXXIV.701
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he sent
him away, and he departed.
1. Because there was there a sacrifice after the order of Aaron, and afterwards He of His
Own Body and Blood appointed a sacrifice after the order of Melchizedek; He changed then
His Countenance in the Priesthood, and sent away the kingdom of the Jews, and came to
the Gentiles. What then is, “He affected”?702 He was full of affection. For what is so full of
affection as the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, seeing our infirmity, that He might
deliver us from everlasting death, underwent temporal death with such great injury and
contumely? “And He drummed:” because a drum is not made, except when a skin is extended
on wood; and David drummed, to signify that Christ should be crucified. But, “He drummed
upon the doors of the city:” what are “the doors of the city,” but our hearts which we had
closed against Christ, who by the drum of His Cross hath opened the hearts of mortal men?
“And was carried in His Own Hands:” how “carried in His Own Hands”? Because when He
commended His Own Body and Blood, He took into His Hands that which the faithful
know; and in a manner carried Himself, when He said, “This is My Body.”703 “And He fell
down at the doors of the gate;” that is, He humbled Himself. For this it is, to fall down even
at the very beginning of our faith. For the door of the gate is the beginning of faith; whence
beginneth the Church, and arriveth at last even unto sight: that as it believeth those things
which it seeth not, it may deserve to enjoy them, when it shall have begun to see face to face.
So is the title of the Psalm; briefly we have heard it; let us now hear the very words of Him
that affecteth, and drummeth upon the doors of the city.
2. “I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall be ever in my mouth” (ver. 1). So
speaketh Christ, so also let a Christian speak; for a Christian is in the Body of Christ; and
therefore was Christ made Man, that that Christian might be enabled to be an Angel, who
saith, “I will bless the Lord at all times.” When shall I “bless the Lord”? When He blesseth
thee? When the goods of this world abound? When thou hast great abundance of corn, oil,
and wine, of gold and silver, of servants and cattle; when this mortal health remaineth un-
wounded and sound; when all that are born to thee grow up, nothing is withdrawn by im-
mature death, happiness wholly reigneth in thy house, and all things overflow around thee;
then shalt thou bless the Lord? No; but “at all times.” Therefore both then, and when accord-
ing to the time, or according to the scourges of our Lord God, these things are troubled, are
taken away, are seldom born to thee, and born pass away. For these things come to pass,
and thence followeth penury, need, labour, pain, and temptation. But thou, who hast sung,

702 [1 Sam. xxi. 13. He follows the Septuagint, which differs from the Vulgate.—C.]
703 Matt. xxvi. 26.
Psalm XXXIV
Psalm XXXIV
“I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall be ever in my mouth,” both when He giveth
them, bless; and when He taketh them away, bless. For it is He that giveth, it is He that taketh
away: but Himself from him that blesseth Him He taketh not away.
3. But who is it that blesseth the Lord at all times, except the humble in heart. For very
humility taught our Lord in His Own Body and Blood: because when He commendeth His
Own Body and Blood, He commendeth His Humility, in that which is written in this history,
in that seeming madness of David, which we have passed by, “And his spittle ran down over
his beard.”704 When the Apostle was read,705 Ye heard the same spittle, but running down
over the beard. One saith perhaps, What spittle have we heard? Was it not read but now,
where the Apostle saith, “The Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom?” But
now it was read, “But we preach,” saith he, “Christ crucified” (for then He drummed),
“unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which
are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God. Because
the Foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the Weakness of God is stronger than men.”706
For spittle signifieth foolishness; spittle signifieth weakness. But if the Foolishness of God
is wiser than men, and the Weakness of God is stronger than men; let not the spittle as it
were offend thee, but observe that it runneth down over the beard: for as by the spittle,
weakness; so by the beard, strength is signified. He covered then His Strength by the body
of His Weakness, and that which without was weak, appeared as it were in spittle; but
within His Divine Strength was covered as a beard. Therefore humility is commended unto
us. Be humble if thou wouldest bless the Lord at all times, and that His praise should be ever
in thy mouth.…
4. But wherefore doth man bless the Lord at all times? Because he is humble. What is it
to be humble? To take not praise unto himself. Who would himself be praised, is proud:
who is not proud, is humble. Wouldest thou not then be proud? That thou mayest be humble,
say what is here written; “In the Lord shall my soul be praised: the humble shall hear thereof
and be glad” (ver. 2). Those then who will not be praised in the Lord, are not humble, but
fierce, rough, lifted up, proud. Gentle cattle would the Lord have; be thou the Lord’s ju-
mentum; that is, be thou humble. He sitteth upon thee, He ruleth thee: fear not lest thou
stumble, and fall headlong: that indeed is thy infirmity; but consider Who sitteth upon thee.
704 1 Sam. xxi. 13.

in the synagogue, so also the Evangelists and Apostles were read ceremonially in the Church.—C.]

Psalm XXXIV
Thou art an ass’s colt, but thou carriest Christ. For even He on an ass’s colt came into the
city; and that beast was gentle.…“Be not ye as the horse or as the mule, which have no un-
derstanding.”707 For horse and mule sometimes lift up their neck, and by their own fierceness
throw off their rider. They are tamed with the bit, with bridle, with stripes, until they learn
to submit, and to carry their master. But thou, before thy jaws are bruised with the bridle,
be humble, and carry thy Lord: wish not praise for thyself, but praised be He who sitteth
upon thee, and say thou, “In the Lord shall my soul be praised; the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad.”…
5. Now followeth, “O magnify the Lord with me” (ver. 3). Who is this that exhorteth
us, that we should magnify the Lord with him? Whoever, Brethren, is in the body of Christ,
ought for this to labour, that the Lord may be magnified with him. For he loveth the Lord,
whoever he is. And how doth he love Him? So as not to envy his fellow-lover.…Let them
blush who so love God as to envy others. Abandoned men love a charioteer, and whoever
loveth a charioteer or hunter, wisheth the whole people to love with him, and exhorteth,
saying, Love with me this pantomime, love with me this or that shame. He calleth among
the people that shame may be loved with him; and doth not a Christian call in the Church,
that the Truth of God may be loved with him? Stir up then love in yourselves, Brethren; and
call to every one of yours, and say, “O magnify the Lord with me.” Let there be in you that
fervour. Wherefore are these things recited and explained? If ye love God, bring quickly to
the love of God all who are joined unto you, and all who are in your house; if the Body of
Christ is loved by you, that is, if the unity of the Church, bring them quickly to enjoy, and
say, “O magnify the Lord with me.”
6. “And let us exalt His Name together.”708 What is, “let us exalt His Name together”?
That is, in one. For many copies so have it, “O magnify the Lord with me; and let us exalt
His Name in one.”709 Whether it be said, “together,” or “in one,” it is the same thing.
Therefore bring quickly whom ye can, by exhorting, by transporting,710 by beseeching, by
disputing, by rendering a reason, with meekness, with gentleness. Bring them quickly unto
love; that if they magnify the Lord, they may magnify Him in one.…
7. “I sought the Lord, and He heard me” (ver. 4). Where heard the Lord? Within. Where
giveth He? Within. There thou prayest, there thou art heard, there thou art blessed. Thou
hast prayed, thou art heard, thou art blessed; and he knoweth not who standeth by thee: it
is all carried on in secret, as the Lord saith in the Gospel, “Enter into thy closet, and when
thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth
707 Ps. xxxii. 9.
708 In idipsum.
709 In unum. [In the Septuagint ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, as in Acts ii. 1.—C.]
710 Al. “by working.”
Psalm XXXIV
in secret, shall reward thee openly.”711 When therefore thou enterest into thy chamber,
thou enterest into thy heart. Blessed are they who rejoice when they enter into their heart,
and find therein nought of evil.…
8. “I sought the Lord, and He heard me.” Who then are not heard, seek not the Lord.
Attend, Holy Brethren;712 he said not, I sought gold from the Lord, and He heard me; I
sought from the Lord long life, and He heard me; I sought from the Lord this or that, and
He heard me. It is one thing to seek anything from the Lord, another to seek the Lord
Himself. “I sought” (saith he) “the Lord, and He heard me.” But thou, when thou prayest,
saying, Kill that my enemy, seekest not the Lord, but, as it were, makest thyself a judge over
thy enemy, and makest thy God an executioner. 713 How knowest thou that he is not better
than thou, whose death thou seekest? In that very thing haply he is, that he seeketh not thine.
Therefore seek not from the Lord anything without, but seek the Lord Himself, and He will
hear thee, and while thou yet speakest, He will say, “Lo, here I am.”714…
9. I have said who was the exhorter, namely, that lover who would not alone embrace
what he loveth, and saith, “Approach unto Him, and be ye lightened” (ver. 5). For he saith
what he himself proved. For some spiritual person in the Body of Christ, or even our Lord
Jesus Christ Himself according to the flesh, the Head exhorting His Own Members, saith;
what? “Approach unto Him, and be ye lightened.” Or rather some spiritual Christian inviteth
us to approach to our Lord Jesus Christ Himself. But let us approach to Him and be lightened;
not as the Jews approached to Him, that they might be darkened; for they approached to
Him that they might crucify Him: let us approach to Him that we may receive His Body
and Blood. They by Him crucified were darkened; we by eating and drinking The Crucified
are lightened. “Approach unto Him, and be ye lightened.” Lo, this is said to the Gentiles.
Christ was crucified amid the Jews raging and seeing; the Gentiles were absent; lo, they have
approached who were in darkness, and they who saw not are lightened. Whereby approach
the Gentiles? By following with faith, by longing with the heart, by running with charity.
Thy feet are thy charity. Have two feet, be not lame. What are thy two feet? The two com-
mandments of love, of thy God, and of thy Neighbour. With these feet run thou unto God,
approach unto Him, for He hath both exhorted thee to run, and hath Himself shed His Own
Light, as he hath magnificently and divinely continued.715 “And your faces shall not be
711 Matt. vi. 6.
712 [He makes the same exhortation to a brother bishop who was present: attendat, Sanctitas Vestra.—C.]

715 So our mss. and others, as Ed. Ben. says, magno consensu. Sicut magnifice et divine secutus est. Ben.
however reads, “so that ye may be able magnificently and divinely to follow Him.” Sic, ut magnifice et divine se
sequi possitis. See on Ps. xxii. Exp. ii. § 16. “Gloriously expressed.” The word is magnifice.
Psalm XXXIV
ashamed.” “Approach” (saith he) “unto Him, and be ye lightened; and your faces shall not
be ashamed.” No face shall be ashamed but of the proud. Wherefore? Because he would be
lifted up, and when he hath suffered insult, or ignominy, or mischance in this world, or any
affliction, he is ashamed. But fear not thou, approach unto Him, and thou shalt not be
ashamed.…
10. As the Prophet testifieth, “The poor man cried, and the Lord heard him” (ver. 6).
He teacheth thee how thou mayest be heard. Therefore art thou not heard, because thou art
rich. Lest haply thou say, thou criedst and wast not heard, hear wherefore; “The poor man
cried, and the Lord heard him.” As poor cry thou, and the Lord heareth. And how shall I
cry as poor? By not, if thou hast aught, presuming therefrom upon thy own strength: by
understanding that thou art needy; by understanding that so long art thou poor, as thou
hast not Him who maketh thee rich. But how did the Lord hear him? “And saved him out
of all his troubles.” And how saveth He men out of all their troubles? “The Angel of the Lord
shall send716 round about them that fear Him, and shall deliver them” (ver. 7). So it is
written, brethren, not as some bad copies have it, “The Lord shall send His Angel round
about them that fear Him, and He shall deliver them:” but thus, “The Angel of the Lord
shall send round about them that fear Him, and shall deliver them.” Whom called He here
the Angel of the Lord, who shall send round about them that fear Him, and shall deliver
them? Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is called in Prophecy, the Angel of the great Counsel,
the Messenger of the great Counsel;717 so the Prophets called Him.718 Even He then, the
Angel of the great Counsel, that is, the Messenger, shall send unto them that fear the Lord,
and shall deliver them. Fear not then lest thou be hid: wheresoever thou hast feared the
Lord, there doth that Angel know thee, who shall send to succour thee, and shall deliver
thee.
11. Now will He speak openly of the same Sacrament, whereby He was carried in His
Own Hands. “O taste and see that the Lord is good” (ver. 8). Doth not the Psalm now open
itself, and show thee that seeming insanity and constant madness, the same insanity and
sober inebriety of that David, who in a figure showed I know not what, when in the person
of king Achis they said to him, How is it? 719 When the Lord said, “Except a man eat My
Flesh and drink My Blood, he shall have no life in him”?720 And they in whom reigned
Achis, that is, error and ignorance, said; what said they? “How can this man give us his flesh
to eat?”721 If thou art ignorant, “Taste and see that the Lord is good:” but if thou understand-

est not, thou art king Achis: David shall change His Countenance and shall depart from
thee, and shall quit thee, and shall depart.722
12. “Blessed is the man that trusteth in Him.” Why needeth this to be explained at length?
Whoever trusteth not in the Lord, is miserable. Who is there that trusteth not in the Lord?
He that trusteth in himself.…
13. “O fear the Lord, all ye His saints, for there is no want to them that fear Him” (ver.
9). For many therefore will not fear God the Lord, lest they suffer hunger. It is said to them,
Defraud not; and they say, Whence can I feed myself? No art can be without imposture; no
business can be without fraud. But fraud God punisheth: fear God. But if I should fear God,
I shall not have whence to live. “O fear the Lord, all ye His saints, for there is no want to
them that fear Him.” He promiseth plenty to him that trembleth, and doubteth, lest haply
if he should fear God, he should lose things superfluous. The Lord fed thee despising Him,
and will He desert thee fearing Him? Attend, and say not, Such an one is rich, and I am
poor. I fear the Lord, he by not fearing how much has he gained, and I by fearing am bare!
See what follows; “The rich723 do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall
not want any good thing” (ver. 10). If thou receive it according to the letter, He seemeth to
deceive thee, for thou seest that many rich men that are wicked die in their riches, and are
not made poor while they live; thou seest them grow old, and come even to the end of life
amid great abundance and riches. Thou seest their funeral pomp celebrated with great
profusion, the man himself brought rich even to the sepulchre, having expired in beds of
ivory, his family weeping around; and thou sayest in thy mind, if haply thou knowest some
both sins and crimes done by him: I know what things that man hath done; lo, he hath
grown old, he hath died in his bed, his friends follow him to the grave, his funeral is celebrated
with all this pomp; I know what he hath done; the Scripture has deceived me, and has spoken
falsely, where I hear and sing; “The rich do lack and suffer hunger.” When was this man in
need? when did he suffer hunger? “But they that seek the Lord shall not want any good
thing.” Daily I rise up to Church, daily I bend the knee, daily I seek the Lord, and have
nothing good: this man sought not the Lord, and he hath died in the midst of all these good
things! Thus thinking, the snare of offence choketh him; for he seeketh mortal food on the
earth, and seeketh not a true reward in heaven, and so he putteth his head into the devil’s
noose, his jaws are tied close, and the devil holdeth him fast unto evil doing, that so he may
imitate the evil men, whom he seeth to die in such plenty.
722 [Luther’s doctrine, and even Calvin’s, admits of this language. Rhetorically, even Zwinglians might use
the same. For the primitive doctrine see Justin Martyr and Irenæus, A.N.F. vol. i. p. 185, note 6, and 528, note
4. Observe also the fragment (xiii.) on p. 570.—C.]
723 E.V. “The young lions do lack,” etc.
Psalm XXXIV
14. Therefore understand it not so.…When thou art filled with spiritual riches, canst
thou be poor? And was he therefore rich, because he had a bed of ivory; and art thou poor
who hast the chamber of thy heart filled with such jewelry of virtues, justice, truth, charity,
faith, endurance? Unfold thy riches, if thou hast them, and compare them with the riches
of the rich. But such an one has found in the market mules of great value, and has bought
them. If thou couldest find faith to be sold, how much wouldest thou give for that, which
God willeth that thou shouldest have gratis, and thou art ungrateful? Those rich then lack,
they lack, and what is heavier, they lack bread.…For He hath said, “I am the Living Bread
which came down from Heaven.”724 And again, “Blessed are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.”725 “But they that seek the Lord shall not
want any good thing:” but what manner of good, I have already said.
15. “Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord” (ver.
11). Ye think,726 brethren, that I say this: think that David saith it; think that an Apostle
saith it; nay think that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself saith it; “Come, ye children, hearken
unto Me.” Let us hearken unto Him together: hearken ye unto Him through us. For He
would teach us; He the Humble, He that drummeth, He that affecteth, would teach us.…
16. “What man is he that desireth life, and loveth to see good days?” (ver. 12). He asketh
a question. Doth not every one among you answer, I? Is there any man among you that
loveth not life, that is, that desireth not life, and loveth not to see good days? Do ye not daily
thus murmur, and thus speak; How long shall we suffer these things? Daily are they worse
and worse: in our fathers’ time were days more joyful, were days better. O if thou couldest
ask those same, thy fathers, in like manner would they murmur to thee of their own days.
Our fathers were happy, miserable are we, evil days have we: such an one ruled over us, we
thought that after his death might some refreshing be given to us; worse things have come:
O God, show unto us good days! “What man is he that desireth life, and loveth to see good
days?” Let him not seek here good days. A good thing he seeketh, but not in its right place
doth he seek it. As, if thou shouldest seek some righteous man in a country, wherein he lived
not, it would be said to thee, A good man thou seekest, a great man thou seekest, seek him
still, but not here; in vain thou seekest him here, thou wilt never find him. Good days thou
seekest, together let us seek them, seek not here.…Read the Scriptures.…
17. Let not a Christian then murmur, let him see whose steps he followeth: but if he
loveth good days, let him hearken unto Him teaching and saying, “Come, ye children,
hearken unto Me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” What wouldest thou? Life and good
days. Hear, and do. “Keep thy tongue from evil” (ver. 13). This do. I will not, saith a miserable
724 John vi. 51.
725 Matt. v. 6; Luke i. 53; 1 Sam. ii. 5.
726 Most mss. “Think,” imperative, as in the other clauses.
Psalm XXXIV
man, I will not keep my tongue from evil, and yet I desire life and good days. If a workman
of thine should say to thee, I indeed lay waste this vineyard, yet I require of thee my reward;
thou broughtest me to the vineyard to lop and prune it, I cut away all the useful wood, I will
cut short also the very trunks of the vines, that thou have thereon nothing to gather, and
when I have done this, thou shalt repay to me my labour. Wouldest thou not call him mad?
Wouldest thou not drive him from thy house or ever he put his hand to the knife? Such are
those men who would both do evil, and swear falsely, and speak blasphemy against God,
and murmur, and defraud, and be drunken, and dispute, and commit adultery, and use
charms, and consult diviners, and withal see good days. To such it is said, thou canst not
doing ill seek a good reward. If thou art unjust, shall God also be unjust? What shall I do,
then? What desirest thou? Life I desire, good days I desire. “Keep thy tongue from evil, and
thy lips that they speak no guile,” that is, defraud not any, lie not to any.
18. But what is, “Depart from evil”? (ver. 14). It is little that thou injure none, murder
none, steal not, commit not adultery, do no wrong, speak no false witness; “Depart from
evil.” When thou hast departed, thou sayest, Now I am safe, I have done all, I shall have life,
I shall see good days. Not only saith he, “Depart from evil,” but also, “and do good.” It is
nothing that thou spoil not: clothe the naked. If thou hast not spoiled, thou hast declined
from evil; but thou wilt not do good, except thou receive the stranger into thine house. So
then depart from evil, as to do good. “Seek peace, and ensue it.” He hath not said, Thou
shalt have peace here; seek it, and ensue it. Whither shall I ensue it? Whither it hath gone
before. For the Lord is our peace, hath risen again, and hath ascended into Heaven. “Seek
peace, and ensue it;” because when thou also hast risen, this mortal shall be changed, and
thou shalt embrace peace there where no man shall trouble thee. For there is perfect peace,
where thou wilt not hunger.…
19. “The Eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous:” fear not then; labour; the eyes of the
Lord are upon thee. “And His Ears are open unto their prayers” (ver. 15). What wouldest
thou more? If an householder in a great house should not hearken to a servant murmuring,
he would complain, and say, What hardship do we here suffer, and none heareth us. Canst
thou say this of God, What hardships I suffer, and none heareth me? If He heard me, haply,
sayest thou, He would take away my tribulation: I cry unto Him, and yet have tribulation.
Only do thou hold fast His ways, and when thou art in tribulation, He heareth thee. But He
is a Physician, and still hast thou something of putrefaction; thou criest out, but still He
cutteth, and taketh not away His Hand, until He hath cut as much as pleaseth Him. For that
Physician is cruel who heareth a man, and spareth his wound and putrefaction. How do
mothers rub their children in the baths for their health. Do not the little ones cry out in
their hands? Are they then cruel because they spare not, nor hearken unto their tears? Are
they not full of affection? And yet the children cry out, and are not spared. So our God also
Psalm XXXIV
is full of charity, but therefore seemeth He not to hear, that He may spare and heal us for
everlasting.
20. Haply say the wicked, I securely do evil, because the Eyes of the Lord are not upon
me: God attendeth to the righteous, me He seeth not, and whatever I do, I do securely. Im-
mediately added the Holy Spirit, seeing the thoughts of men, and said, “But the Face of the
Lord is against them that do evil; to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth” (ver.
16).
21. “The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them, and delivered them out of all their
troubles” (ver. 17). Righteous were the Three Children; out of the furnace cried they unto
the Lord, and in His praises their flames cooled. The flame could not approach nor hurt the
innocent and righteous Children praising God, and He delivered them out of the fire.727
Some one saith, Lo, truly righteous were those who were heard, as it is written, “The righteous
cried, and the Lord heard them, and delivered them out of all their troubles:” but I have
cried, and He delivereth me not; either I am not righteous, or I do not728 the things which
He commandeth me, or haply He seeth me not. Fear not: only do what He commandeth;
and if He deliver thee not bodily, He will deliver thee spiritually. For He who took out of
the fire the Three Children, did He take out of the fire the Maccabees?729 Did not the first
sing hymns in the flames, these last in the flames expire? The God of the Three Children,
was not He the God also of the Maccabees? The one He delivered, the other He delivered
not. Nay, He delivered both: but the Three Children He so delivered, that even the carnal
were confounded; but the Maccabees therefore He delivered not so, that those who persecuted
them should go into greater torments, while they thought that they had overcome God’s
Martyrs. He delivered Peter, when the Angel came unto him being in prison, and said,
“Arise, and go forth,”730 and suddenly his chains were loosed, and he followed the Angel,
and He delivered him. Had Peter lost righteousness when He delivered him not from the
cross? Did He not deliver him then? Even then He delivered him. Did his long life make
him unrighteous? Haply He heard him more at last than at first, when truly He delivered
him out of all his troubles. For when He first delivered him, how many things did he suffer
afterwards! For thither He sent him at last, where he could have suffered no evil.
22. “The Lord is nigh unto them that have broken their heart; and saveth such as be
lowly in spirit” (ver. 18). God is High: let a Christian be lowly. If he would that the Most
High God draw nigh unto him, let him be lowly. A great mystery, Brethren. God is above
all: thou raisest thyself, and touchest not Him: thou humblest thyself, and He descendeth
727 Dan. iii. 28.
728 Al. “and do not.”
729 2 Macc. vii. 3.
730 Acts xii. 7.
Psalm XXXIV
unto thee. “Many are the troubles of the righteous” (ver. 19): doth He say, “Therefore let
Christians be righteous, therefore let them hear My Word, that they may suffer no tribulation?
He promiseth not this; but saith, “Many are the troubles of the righteous.” Rather, if they
be unrighteous they have fewer troubles, if righteous they have many. But after few tribula-
tions, or none, these shall come to tribulation everlasting, whence they shall never be de-
livered: but the righteous after many tribulations shall come to peace everlasting, where
they shall never suffer any evil. “Many are the tribulations of the righteous: but the Lord
delivereth him out of all.”
23. “The Lord keepeth all their bones: not one of them shall be broken” (ver. 20): this
also, Brethren, let us not receive carnally. Bones are the firm supports of the faithful. For as
in flesh our bones give firmness, so in the heart of a Christian it is faith that gives firmness.731
The patience then which is in faith, is as the bones of the inner man: this is that which cannot
be broken. “The Lord keepeth all their bones: not one of them shall be broken.” If of our
Lord God Jesus Christ he had said this, “The Lord keepeth all the bones of His Son; not one
of them shall be broken;” as is prefigured of Him also in another place, when the lamb was
spoken of that should be slain, and it was said of it, “Neither shall ye break a bone thereof:”
732 then was it fulfilled in the Lord, because when He hung upon the Cross, He expired before
they came to the Cross, and found His Body lifeless already, and would not break His legs,
that it might be fulfilled which was written.733 But He gave this promise to other Christians
also, “The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of them shall be broken.” Therefore, Brethren,
if we see any Saint suffer tribulation, and haply either by a Physician so cut, or by some
persecutor so mangled, that his bones be broken; let us not say, This man was not righteous,
for this hath the Lord promised to His righteous, of whom He said, “The Lord keepeth all
their bones; not one of them shall be broken.” Wouldest thou see that He spoke of other
bones, those which we called the firm supports of faith, that is, patience and endurance in
all tribulations? For these are the bones which are not broken. Hear, and see ye in the very
Passion of our Lord, what I say. The Lord was in the middle Crucified; near Him were two
thieves: the one mocked, the other believed: the one was condemned, the other justified:
the one had his punishment both in this world, and that which shall be, but unto the other
said the Lord, “Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise;”734 and
yet those who came brake not the bones of the Lord, but of the thieves they brake: as much
were broken the bones of the thief who blasphemed, as of the thief who believed. Where
731 [“Let us not receive carnally” is language which reflects light upon ver. 8, p. 75, supra. Note also what is
here said of faith.—C.]
732 Exod. xii. 46.
733 John xix. 33.
734 Luke xxiii. 43.
Psalm XXXIV
then is that which is spoken, “The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of them shall be
broken”? Lo, unto whom He said, “To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise,” could He
keep all his bones? The Lord answereth thee: Yea, I kept them: for the firm support of his
faith could not be broken by those blows whereby his legs were broken.
24. “The death of sinners is the worst” (ver. 21). Attend, Brethren, for the sake of those
things which I said. Truly Great is the Lord, and His Mercy, truly Great is He who gave to
us to eat His Body, wherein He suffered such great things, and His Blood to drink. How
regardeth He them that think evil and say, “Such an one died ill, by beasts was he devoured:
he was not a righteous man, therefore he perished ill; for else would he not have perished.”
Is he then righteous who dieth in his own house and in his own bed? This then (sayest thou)
it is whereat I wonder; because I know the sins and the crimes of this same man, and yet he
died well; in his own house, within his own doors, with no injury of travel, with none even
in mature735 age. Hearken, “The death of sinners is worst.” What seemeth to thee a good
death, is worst if thou couldest see within. Thou seest him outwardly lying on his bed, dost
thou see him inwardly carried to hell? Hearken, Brethren, and learn from the Gospel what
is the “worst death” of sinners. Were there not two in that age,736 a rich man who was clothed
in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day; another a poor man who lay at
his door full of sores, and the dogs came and licked his sores, and he desired to be fed with
the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table? Now it came to pass that the poor man
died (righteous was that poor man), and was carried by Angels into Abraham’s bosom. He
who saw his body lying at the rich man’s door, and no man to bury it, what haply said he?
So die he who is my enemy; and whoever persecutes me, so may I see him. His body is ac-
cursed with spitting, his wounds stink; and yet in Abraham’s bosom he resteth.737 If we are
Christians, let us believe: if we believe not, Brethren, let none feign himself a Christian. Faith
bringeth us to the end. As the Lord spake these things, so are they. Doth indeed an astrolo-
ger738 speak unto thee, and it is true, and doth Christ speak, and it is false? But by what sort
of death died the rich man? What sort of death must it not be in purple and fine linen, how
sumptuous, how pompous! What funeral ceremonies were there! In what spices was that
body buried! And yet when he was in hell, being in torments, from the finger of that despised
poor man he desired one drop of water to be poured upon his burning tongue, and obtained
735 Al. “even at no premature.”
736 Al. “in this world.”
737 Luke xvi. 19–22.

it not. Learn then what meaneth, “The death of sinners is worst;” and ask not beds covered
with costly garments, and to have the flesh wrapped in many rich things, friends exhibiting
a show of lamentation, a household beating their breasts, a crowd of attendants going before
and following when the body is carried out, marble and gilded memorials. For if ye ask those
things, they answer you what is false, that of many not light sinners, but altogether wicked,
the death is best, who have deserved to be so lamented, so embalmed, so covered, so carried
out, so entombed. But ask the Gospel, and it will show to your faith the soul of the rich man
burning in torments, which was nothing profited by all those honours and obsequies, which
to his dead body the vanity of the living did afford.
25. But because there are many kinds of sinners, and not to be a sinner is difficult, or
perhaps in this life impossible, he added immediately, of what kind of sinners the death is
worst. “And they that hate the righteous one” (saith he) “shall perish.” What righteous one,
but “Him that justifieth the ungodly”?739 Whom, but our Lord Jesus Christ, who is also “the
propitiation for our sins”?740 Who then hate Him, have the worst death; because they die
in their sins, who are not through Him reconciled to our God. “For the Lord redeemeth the
souls of His servants.” But according to the soul is death to be understood either the worst
or best, not according to bodily either dishonour, or honours which men see. “And none
of them which trust in Him shall perish” (ver. 22); this is the manner of human righteousness,
that mortal life, however advanced, because without sin it cannot be, in this perisheth not,
while it trusteth in Him, in whom is remission of sins. Amen.

Psalm XXXIV
Psalm XXXV.741
1. …The title of it causeth us no delay, for it is both brief, and to be understood not
difficult, especially to those nursed in the Church of God. For so it is, “To David himself.”
The Psalm then is to David himself: now David is interpreted, Strong in hand, or Desirable.
The Psalm then is to the Strong in hand, and Desirable, to Him who for us hath overcome
death, who unto us hath promised life: for in this is He Strong in hand, that He hath overcome
death for us; in this is He Desirable, that He hath promised unto us life eternal. For what
stronger than that Hand which touched the bier, and he that was dead rose up?742 What
stronger than that Hand which overcame the world, not armed with steel, but pierced with
wood? Or what more desirable than He, whom not having seen, the Martyrs wished even
to die, that they might be worthy to come unto Him? Therefore is the Psalm unto Him: to
Him let our heart, to Him our tongue sing worthily: if yet Himself shall deign to give
somewhat to sing.…
2. “Judge Thou, O Lord” (saith he), “them that hurt me, and fight Thou against them
that fight against me” (ver. 1). “If God be for us, who can be against us?”743 And whereby
doth God this for us? “Take hold” (saith he) “of arms and shield, and rise up to my help”
(ver. 2). A great spectacle is it, to see God armed for thee. And what is His Shield, what are
His Arms? “Lord,” in another place saith the man who here also speaketh, “as with the shield
of Thy good-will hast Thou compassed us.”744 But His Arms, wherewith He may not only
us defend, but also strike His enemies, if we have well profited, shall we ourselves be. For
as we from Him have this, that we be armed, so is He armed from us. But He is armed from
those whom He hath made, we are armed with those things which we have received from
Him who made us. These our arms the Apostle in a certain place calleth, “The shield of
Faith, the helmet of Salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.”745
He hath armed us with such arms as ye have heard, arms admirable, and unconquered, in-
superable and shining; spiritual truly and invisible, because we have to fight also against
invisible enemies. If thou seest thine enemy, let thine arms be seen. We are armed with faith
in those things which we see not, and we overthrow enemies whom we see not.…
3. “Pour forth the weapon, and stop the way against them that persecute me” (ver. 3).
Who are they that persecute thee? Haply thy neighbour, or he whom thou hast offended,
or to whom thou hast done wrong, or who would take away what is thine, or against whom

thou preachest the truth, or whose sin thou rebukest, or whom living ill by thy well living
thou offendest. There are indeed even these enemies to us, and they persecute us: but other
enemies we are taught to know, those against whom we fight invisibly, of whom the Apostle
warneth us, saying, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood,”746 that is, against men; not
against those whom ye see, but against those whom ye see not; “against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the world, of this darkness.”…“The whole world lieth in
wickedness;”747 therefore the Apostle explained of what world they were rulers, he said, “of
this darkness.” The rulers of this world, I say, are the rulers of this darkness.…
4. And what follows? “Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my
soul” (ver. 4): for to this end they seek after it, to destroy it. For I would that they would
seek it for good! for in another Psalm he blameth this in men, that there was none who
would seek after his soul: “Refuge failed me: there was none that would seek after my soul.”748
Who is this that saith, “There was none that would seek after my soul”?749 Is it haply He,
of whom so long before it was predicted, “They pierced My Hands and My Feet, they
numbered all My Bones, they stared and looked upon Me, they have parted My Garments
among them, and cast lots for My Vesture”?750 Now all these things were done before their
eyes, and there was none who would seek after His Soul.…
5. …Many have been confounded to their health: many, put to shame, have passed over
from the persecution of Christ to the society of His members with devoted piety; and this
would not have been, had they not been confounded and put to shame. Therefore he wished
well to them.…Let them not go before, but follow; let them not give counsel, but take it. For
Peter would go before the Lord, when the Lord spake of His future Passion: he would to
Him as it were give counsel for His health. The sick man to the Saviour give counsel for His
health! And what said he to the Lord, affirming that His future Passion? “Be it far from
Thee, Lord. Be gracious to Thyself. This shall not be to Thee.” He would go before that the
Lord might follow; and what said He? “Get thee behind Me, Satan.”751 By going before thou
art Satan, by following thou wilt be a disciple. The same then is said to these also, “Let them
be turned back and brought to confusion that think evil against me.” For when they have
begun to follow after, now they will not think evil against me, but desire my good.

6. What of others? For all are not so conquered as to be converted and believe: many
continue in obstinacy, many preserve in heart the spirit of going before, and if they exert it
not, yet they labour with it, and finding opportunity bring it forth. Of such, what followeth?
“Let them be as dust before the wind” (ver. 5). “Not so are the ungodly, not so; but as the
dust which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth.”752 The wind is temptation;
the dust are the ungodly. When temptation cometh, the dust is raised, it neither standeth
nor resisteth. “Let them be as dust before the wind, and let the Angel of the Lord trouble
them.” “Let their way be darkness and slipping” (ver. 6). A horrible way! Darkness alone
who feareth not? A slippery way alone who avoids not? In a dark and slippery way how shalt
thou go? where set foot? These two ills are the great punishments of men: darkness, ignorance;
a slippery way, luxury. “And let the Angel of the Lord persecute them;” that they be not able
to stand. For any one in a dark and slippery way, when he seeth that if he move his foot he
will fall, and there is no light before his feet, haply resolveth to wait until light come; but
here is the Angel of the Lord persecuting them. These things he predicted would come upon
them, not as though he wished them to happen. Although the Prophet in the Spirit of God
so speaketh these things, even as God doth the same, with sure judgment, with a judgment
good, righteous, holy, tranquil; not moved with wrath, not with bitter jealousy, not with
desire of wreaking enmities, but of punishing wickedness with righteousness; nevertheless,
it is a prophecy.
7. But wherefore these so great evils? By what desert? Hear by what desert. “For without
cause have they hid for me the corruption of their trap” (ver. 7). For Him that is our Head,
observe, the Jews did this: they hid the corruption of their trap. For whom hid they their
trap? For Him who saw the hearts of those that hid. But yet was He among them like one
ignorant, as though He were deceived, whereas they were in that deceived, that they thought
Him to be deceived. For therefore was He as though deceived, living among them, because
we among such as they were so to live, as to be without doubt deceived. He saw His betrayer,
and chose him the more to a necessary work. By his evil He wrought a great good: and yet
among the twelve was he chosen, lest even the small number of twelve should be without
one evil. This was an example of patience to us, because it was necessary that we should live
among the evil: it was necessary that we should endure the evil, either knowing them or
knowing them not: an example of patience He gave thee lest thou shouldest fail, when thou
hast begun to live among the evil. And because that School of Christ in the twelve failed
not, how much more ought we to be firm, when in the great Church is fulfilled what was
predicted of the mixture of the evil.…
8. But yet what is to be done? “Without a cause have they hid for me the corruption of
their trap.” What meaneth, “Without a cause”? I have done them no evil, I have hurt them
752 Ps. i. 4.
Psalm XXXV
not at all. “Vainly have they reviled my soul.” What is, “Vainly”? Speaking falsely, proving
nothing. “Let a trap come upon them which they know not of” (ver. 8). A magnificent retri-
bution, nothing more just! They have hidden a trap that I might know not: let a trap come
upon them which they know not of. For I know of their trap. But what trap is coming upon
them? That which they know not of. Let us hear, lest haply he speak of that. “Let a trap come
upon them, which they know not of.” Perhaps that is one which they hid for him, that an-
other which shall come upon themselves. Not so: but what? “The wicked shall be holden
with the cords of his own sins.” 753 Thereby are they deceived, whereby they would deceive.
Thence shall come mischief to them, whence they endeavoured mischief. For it follows,
“And let the net which they have hidden catch themselves, and let them fall into their own
trap.” As if any one should prepare a cup of poison for another, and forgetting should drink
it up himself: or as if one should dig a pit, that his enemy might fall thereinto in the darkness
and himself forgetting what he had dug, should first walk that way, and fall into it.…
9. This then for the wicked that would hurt me: what for me? “But my soul shall rejoice
in the Lord” (ver. 9); as in Him from whom it hath heard, “I am thy salvation;” as not seeking
other riches from without; as not seeking to abound in pleasures and good things of earth;
but loving freely the true Spouse, not from Him wishing to receive aught that may delight,
but Him alone proposing to itself, by whom it may be delighted. For what better than God
will be given unto me? God loveth me: God loveth thee. See He hath proposed to thee, Ask
what thou wilt.754 If the emperor should say to thee, Ask what thou wilt, what commands,755
what dignities,756 wouldest thou burst forth with! What great things wouldest thou propose
to thyself, both to receive and to bestow! When God saith unto thee, Ask what thou wilt,
what wilt thou ask? empty thy mind, exert thy avarice, stretch forward as far as possible,
and enlarge thy desire: it is not any one, but Almighty God that said, Ask what thou wilt. If
of possessions thou art a lover, thou wilt desire the whole earth, that all who are born may
be thy husbandmen, or thy slaves. And what when thou hast possessed the whole earth?
Thou wilt ask the sea, in which yet thou canst not live. In this greediness the fishes will have
the better of thee. But perhaps thou wilt possess the islands. Pass over these also; ask the air
although thou canst not fly; stretch thy desire even unto the heavens, call thine own the sun,
the moon, and the stars, because He who made all said, Ask what thou wilt: yet nothing wilt
thou find more precious, nothing wilt thou find better, than Himself who made all things.
Him seek, who made all things, and in Him and from Him shalt thou have all things which
He made. All things are precious, because all are beautiful; but what more beautiful than

He? Strong are they; but what stronger than He? And nothing would He give thee rather
than Himself. If aught better thou hast found, ask it. If thou ask aught else, thou wilt do
wrong to Him, and harm to thyself, by preferring to Him that which He made, when He
would give to thee Himself who made.…
“But my soul shall be joyful in the Lord; it shall rejoice in His salvation.” The salvation
of God is Christ: “For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.”757
10. “All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto Thee” (ver. 10). Who can speak
anything worthily of these words? I think them only to be pronounced, not to be expounded.
Why seekest thou this or that? What is like unto thy Lord? Him hast thou before thee. “The
unrighteous have declared unto me delights, but not after Thy law, O Lord!”758 Persecutors
have been who have said, Worship Saturn, worship Mercury. I worship not idols (saith he):
“Lord, who is like unto Thee? They have eyes, and see not; ears have they, but they hear
not.”759 “Lord, who is like unto Thee,” who hast made the eye to see, the ear to hear? But I
(saith he) worship not idols, for them a workman made. Worship a tree or mountain; did
a workman make them also? Here too, Lord, who is like unto Thee? Earthly things are shown
unto me; Thou art Creator of the earth. And from these haply they turn to the higher creation,
and say to me, Worship the Moon, worship this Sun, who with his light, as a great lamp in
the Heavens, maketh the day. Here also I plainly say, “Lord, who is like unto Thee?” The
Moon and the Stars Thou hast made, the Sun to rule the day hast Thou kindled, the Heavens
hast Thou framed together. There are many invisible things better. But haply here also it is
said to me, Worship Angels, adore Angels. And here also will I say, “Lord, who is like unto
Thee?” Even the Angels Thou hast created. The Angels are nothing, but by seeing Thee. It
is better with them to possess Thee, than by worshipping them to fall from Thee.
11. O Body of Christ, Holy Church, let all thy bones say, “Lord, who is like unto thee?”
And if the flesh under persecution hath fallen away, let the bones say, “Lord, who is like
unto Thee?” For of the righteous it is said, “The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of
them shall be broken.”760 Of how many righteous have the bones under persecution been
broken? Finally, “The just shall live by faith,”761 and “Christ justifieth the ungodly.”762 But

Psalm XXXV
how justifieth He any except believing and confessing? “For with the heart man believeth
unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”763 Therefore
also that thief, although from His theft led to the judge, and from the judge to the cross, yet
on the very cross was justified: with his heart he believed, with his mouth he confessed. For
neither to a man unrighteous and not already justified, would the Lord have said, “To-day
shalt thou be with Me in Paradise,”764 and yet his bones were broken. For when they came
to take down the bodies, by reason of the approaching Sabbath, the Lord was found already
dead, and His Bones were not broken.765 But of those that yet lived, that they might be taken
down, the legs were broken, that so from this pain having died, they might be buried. Were
then of the one thief, who persisted in his ungodliness on the cross, the bones broken, and
not also of the other who with his heart believed, and with his mouth made confession unto
salvation? Where then is that which was said, “The Lord keepeth all his bones; not one of
them shall be broken;” except that in the Body of the Lord the name of bones is given to all
the righteous, the firm in heart, the strong, yielding to no persecutions, no temptations, so
as to consent unto evil?…
12. “Which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him; yea, the poor and
needy from him that spoileth him.”…Who that deliverest, but He who is Strong in hand?
Even that David shall deliver the poor from him that is too strong for him. For the devil was
too strong for thee, and held thee, because he conquered thee, when thou consentedst unto
him. But what hath the Strong in hand done? “No man entereth into a strong man’s house,
to spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man.”766 By His own Power, most Holy,
most Magnificent, hath He bound the devil by pouring forth the weapon to stop the way
against him, that He may deliver the poor and needy, to whom there was no helper.767 For
who is thy helper but the Lord to whom thou sayest, “O Lord, My Strength, and My Redeem-
er.”768 If thou wilt presume of thy own strength, thereby wilt thou fall, whereof thou hast
presumed: if of another’s, he would lord it over thee, not succour thee. He then alone is to
be sought Who hath redeemed them, and made them free, and hath given His Blood to
purchase them, and of His servants hath made them His Brethren.…
13. Let then our Head say, “False witnesses did rise up, they laid to My charge things
that I knew not” (ver. 11). But let us say to our Head, Lord, what knewest Thou not? Didst
Thou indeed know not anything? Didst Thou not know the hearts of them that charged

Thee? Didst Thou not foresee their deceits? Didst Thou not give Thyself into their hands
knowingly? Hadst Thou not come that Thou mightest suffer by them? What then knewest
Thou not? He knew not sin, and thereby He knew not sin, not by not judging, but by not
committing. There are phrases of this kind also in daily use, as when thou sayest of any one,
He knoweth not to stand, that is, he doth not stand; and, He knoweth not to do good, because
he doth not good; and, He knoweth not to do ill, because he doth not ill.…What knew not
Christ so much, as to blaspheme? Thereof was He called in question by His persecutors,
and because He spake truth, He was judged to have spoken blasphemy.769 But by whom?
By them of whom it followeth, “They rewarded Me evil for good, and barrenness to My
Soul” (ver. 12). I gave unto them fruitfulness, they rewarded Me barrenness; I gave life, they
death; I honour, they dishonour; I medicine, they wounds; and in all these which they rewar-
ded Me, was truly barrenness. This barrenness in the tree He cursed, when seeking fruit He
found none.770 Leaves there were, and fruit there was not: words there were, and deeds
there were not. See of words abundance, and of deeds barrenness. “Thou that preachest a
man should not steal, stealest: thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, committest
adultery.”771 Such were they who charged Christ with things that He knew not.
14. “But I, when they troubled me, clothed myself with sackcloth, and humbled my soul
with fasting, and my prayer shall return into mine own bosom” (ver. 13)…Brethren, if for
some little space with pious curiosity we lift the veil, and search with the intent eye of the
heart the inner part of this Scripture, we find that even this the Lord did. Sackcloth, haply
He calleth His mortal flesh. Wherefore Sackcloth? For the likeness of sinful flesh. For the
Apostle saith, “God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that through sin He might
condemn sin in the flesh:”772 that is, He clothed His Own Son with sackcloth, that through
sackcloth773 He might condemn the goats. Not that there was sin, I say not in the Word of
God, but not even in that Holy Soul and Mind of a Man, which the Word and Wisdom of
God had so joined to Himself as to be One Person. Nay, nor even in His very Body was any
sin, but the likeness of sinful flesh there was in the Lord; because death is not but by sin,774
769 Matt. xxvi. 65.

772 Rom. viii. 3.

33.
774 Rom. v. 12.
Psalm XXXV
and surely that Body was mortal. For had It not been mortal, It had not died; had It not
died, It had not risen again; had It not risen again, It had not showed us an example of
eternal life. So then death, which is caused by sin, is called sin; as we say the Greek tongue,
the Latin tongue, meaning not the very member of flesh, but that which is done by the
member of flesh. For the tongue in our members is one among others, as the eyes, nose,
ears, and the rest: but the Greek tongue is Greek words, not that the tongue is words, but
that words are by the tongue.…So then the sin of the Lord is that which was caused by sin;
because He assumed flesh, of the same lump which had deserved death by sin. For to speak
more briefly, Mary who was of Adam died for sin,775 Adam died for sin, and the Flesh of
the Lord which was of Mary died to put away sin. With this sackcloth the Lord clothed
Himself, and therefore was He not known, because He lay hid under sackcloth. “When
they,” saith He, “troubled Me, I clothed Myself with sackcloth:” that is, they raged, I lay hid.
For had He not willed to lie hid neither could He have died, since in one moment of time
one drop only of His Power, if indeed it is to be called a drop, He put forth, when they wished
to seize Him, and at His one question, “Whom seek ye?” they all went back and fell to the
ground.776 Such power could He not have humbled in passion, if He had not lain hid under
sackcloth.
15. Again, if we have understood the sackcloth, how understand we the fasting? Wished
Christ to eat, when He sought fruit on the tree,777 and if He had found, would He have
eaten? Wished Christ to drink, when He said to the woman of Samaria, “Give Me to
drink”?778 when He said on the Cross, “I thirst”?779 For what hungered, for what thirsted
Christ, but our good works? Because in them that crucified and persecuted Him He had
found no good works, He fasted; for they rewarded barrenness to His soul. For what a fast
was His, who found barely one thief, whom on the Cross He might taste! For the Apostles
had fled, and had hidden themselves in the multitude. And even Peter, who even to the
death of his Lord had promised to persevere, had now thrice denied Him, had now wept,
and still lay hid in the multitude, still feared lest He should be known. Lastly, having seen
Him dead, all of them despaired of their own safety and despairing He found them, after
His resurrection, and when He spake with them, found them grieving and mourning, no
longer hoping anything.…In great fasting had the Lord remained, had He not refreshed

them that He might feed on them. For He refreshed them, He comforted them, He confirmed
them, and into His Own Body converted them. In this manner then was our Lord also in
fasting.
16. “And My prayer shall return into Mine Own Bosom.” In the bosom of this verse is
plainly a great depth, and may the Lord grant that it be fathomable by us. For in the “bosom”
a secret is understood. And we ourselves, Brethren, are here well admonished to pray within
our own bosom, where God seeth, where God heareth, where no human eye penetrateth,
where none seeth but He who succoureth; where Susanna prayed, and her voice, though it
was not heard by men, yet by God was heard.780…We read also that in the mount Jesus
prayed alone,781 we read that He passed the night in prayer,782 even at the time of His Pas-
sion.783 What then? “And My prayer shall return into Mine Own Bosom.” I know not what
better to understand concerning the Lord: take meanwhile what now occurs;784 perhaps
something better will occur hereafter, either to me or to some better: “My prayer shall return
into Mine Own Bosom:” this I understand to be said, because in His Own Bosom He had
the Father. “For God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself.”785 In Himself He
had Him to whom He prayed. He was not far from Him, for Himself had said, “I am in the
Father, and the Father in Me.”786 But because prayer rather belongeth to very Man (for ac-
cording as Christ is the Word, He prayeth not, but heareth prayer; and seeketh not to be
succoured for Himself, but with the Father succoureth all): what is, “My prayer shall return
into Mine Own Bosom,” but in Me My Manhood invoketh in Me My Godhead.
17. “As a Neighbour, as our Brother, so I pleased Him: as one mourning and sorrowful,
so I humbled myself” (ver. 14). Now looketh He back to His Own Body: let us now look to
this. When we rejoice in prayer, when our mind is calmed, not by the world’s prosperity,
but by the light of Truth: (who perceiveth this light, knoweth what I say, and he seeth and
acknowledgeth what is said, “As a Neighbour, as our Brother, so I pleased Him”): even then
our soul pleaseth God, not placed afar off, for, “In Him,” saith one, “we live and move and
have our being,” 787 but as a Brother, as a Neighbour, as a Friend. But if it be not such that
it can so rejoice, so shine, so approach, so cleave unto Him, and seeth itself far off thence,

then let it do what followeth, “As one mourning and sorrowful, so I humbled Myself. As
our Brother, so I pleased Him,” said He, drawing near; “As one mourning and sorrowful,
so I humbled Myself,” said He, removed and set afar off.…Did not Peter draw near, when
he said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God”? And yet the same man became
afar off by saying, “Be it far from Thee, Lord; this shall not be unto Thee.” Lastly, what said
He, his Neighbour, as it were, to him drawing near? “Blessed art thou, Simon, Barjona.” To
him afar off, as it were, and unlike, what said He? “Get thee behind Me, Satan.”788 To him
drawing near, “Flesh and blood,” saith He, “hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father,
which is in Heaven.” His Light is shed over thee, in His Light thou shinest. But when having
become afar off, he spake against the Lord’s Passion, which should be for our Salvation,
“Thou savourest not,” said He, “the things that be of God, but those that be of men.” One
rightly placing together both of these saith in a certain Psalm, “I said in my ecstasy, I am
cast off from before Thine Eyes.”789 In my ecstasy, would he not have said, had he not drawn
near; for ecstasy is the transporting of the mind. He poured over himself his own soul, and
drew near unto God; and through some cloud and weight of the flesh being again cast down
to earth, and recollecting where he had been, and seeing where he was, he said, “I am cast
off from before Thine Eyes.” This then, “As a Neighbour, as our Brother, so I pleased Him,”
may He grant to be done in us; but when that is not, let even this be done, “As one mourning
and sorrowful, so I humbled myself.”
18. “And against Me they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together”790 (ver. 15),
against Me only: they rejoicing, I sorrowful. But we heard just now in the Gospel, “Blessed
are they that mourn.”791 If they are blessed that mourn, miserable are they that laugh.
“Against Me they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: scourges were gathered together
against Me, and they knew not.”792 Because they laid to My charge things that I knew not,
they also knew not Whom they charged.
19. “They tempted Me, and mocked Me with mocking”793 (ver. 16). That is, they derided
Me, they insulted Me; this of the Head, this of the Body. Consider, Brethren, the glory of
the Church which now is; remember its past dishonours, remember how once were Chris-
tians everywhere put to flight, and wherever found, mocked, beaten, slain, exposed to beasts,
burned, men rejoicing against them. As it was to the Head, so it is also to the Body. For as

it was to the Lord on the Cross, so has it been to His Body in all that persecution which was
made but now: nor even now cease the persecutions of the same. Wherever men find a
Christian, they are wont to insult, to persecute, to deride him, to call him dull, senseless, of
no spirit, of no knowledge. Do they what they will, Christ is in Heaven: do they what they
will, He hath honoured His punishment, already hath He fixed His Cross in the foreheads
of all; the ungodly is permitted to insult, to rage he is not permitted; but yet from that which
the tongue uttereth, is understood what he beareth in his heart: “They gnashed upon Me
with their teeth.”
20. “Lord, when wilt Thou look on? Rescue My Soul from their deceits, My Darling
from the lions” (ver. 17). For to us the time is slow; and in our person is this said, “When
wilt Thou look on?” that is, when shall we see vengeance upon those who insult us? When
shall the Judge, overcome by weariness, hear the widow?794 But our Judge, not from weari-
ness, but from love, delayeth our salvation; from reason, not from need; not that He could
not even now succour us, but that the number of us all may be filled up even to the end.
And yet out of our desire, what do we say? “Lord, when wilt Thou look on? Rescue My Soul
from their deceits, My Darling from the lions:” that is, My Church from raging powers.
21. Lastly, wouldest thou know what is that Darling? Read the words following: “I will
confess unto Thee, O Lord, in the great Congregation; in a weighty795 people will I praise
Thee” (ver. 18). Truly saith He, “I will confess unto Thee:” for confession is made in all the
multitude, but not in all is God praised: the whole multitude heareth our confession,796 but
not in all the multitude is the praise of God. For in all the whole multitude, that is, in the
Church which is spread abroad in the whole world, is chaff, and wheat: the chaff flieth, the
wheat remaineth; therefore, “in a weighty people will I praise Thee.” In a weighty people,
which the wind of temptation carries not away, in such is God praised. For in the chaff He
is ever blasphemed.…
22. “Let not them that are Mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over Me:” for they rejoice
over Me because of My chaff. “Who hate Me without a cause;” that is, whom I never hurt;
“winking with their eyes” (ver. 19): that is, pretending hypocrites, “For they spake indeed
peace to Me” (ver. 20). What is, “winking with their eyes”? Declaring by their looks, what
they carry not in their heart. And who are these “winking with their eyes”? “For they spake
indeed peace to Me; and with wrath devised craftily.” “Yea they opened their mouth wide
against Me” (ver. 21). First winking with their eyes, those lions sought to ravish and devour;
first fawning they spake peace, and then with wrath devised craftily. What peace spake they?

Psalm XXXV
“Master, we know that Thou acceptest not man’s person, and teachest the way of God in
truth. Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?” They spake indeed peace unto Me.
What then? Didst not Thou know them, and deceived they Thee, winking with their eyes?
Truly He knew them; therefore said He, “Why tempt ye Me, ye hypocrites?”797 Afterward,
“they opened their mouth wide against Me,” crying, “Crucify Him, Crucify Him!798 and
said, Aha, Aha, our eyes have seen it.” This, when they insulted Him, “Aha, Aha, Prophesy
unto us, Thou Christ.”799 As their peace was pretended when they tempted Him concerning
the money, so now insulting was their praise. “They said, Aha, Aha, our eyes have seen it”
(ver. 21): that is, Thy deeds, Thy miracles. This Man is the Christ. “If He be the Christ, let
Him come down from the Cross, and we will believe Him. He saved others, Himself He
cannot save.”800 “Our eyes have seen it.” This is all whereof He boasted Himself, when “He
called Himself the Son of God.”801 But the Lord was hanging patient upon the Cross: His
power had He not lost, but He showed His patience. For what great thing was it for Him to
come down from the Cross, who could afterward rise again from the sepulchre? But He
seems to have yielded to His insulters; and this, beloved, that having risen again He should
show Himself to His own, and not to them, and this is a great mystery; for His resurrection
signified the New Life, but the New Life is known to His friends, not to His enemies.
23. “This Thou hast seen, O Lord; keep not silence” (ver. 22). What is, “keep not silence”?
Judge Thou. For of judgment is it said in a certain place,802 “I have kept silence; shall I keep
silence for ever?” And of the delaying of judgment it is said to the sinner, “These things hast
thou done, and I kept silence;” “Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thy-
self.”803 How keepeth He silence, who speaketh by the Prophets, who speaketh with His
own mouth in the Gospel, who speaketh by the Evangelists, who speaketh by us, when we
speak the truth? What then? He keepeth silence from judgment, not from precept, not from
doctrine. But this His judgment the Prophet in a manner invoketh, and predicteth: “Thou
hast seen, O Lord: keep not silence;” that is, Thou wilt not keep silence, needs must that
Thou wilt judge. “O Lord, be not far from Me.” Until Thy judgment come, be not far from
Me, as Thou hast promised, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”
24. “Arise, Lord, and attend to My judgment” (ver. 23). To what judgment? That Thou
art in tribulation; that Thou art tormented with labours and pains? Do not even many wicked

men suffer the same? To what judgment? Therefore art Thou righteous, because Thou suf-
ferest these things? No: but what? “To My judgment.” What followeth? “Attend to My
judgment; even to My cause, My God, and My Lord.” Not to My punishment, but to My
cause: not to that which the robber hath in common with Me, but to that whereof is said,
“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake.”804 For this cause is distin-
guished. For punishment is equal to good and bad. Therefore Martyrs, not the punishment,
but the cause maketh, for if punishment made Martyrs, all the mines would be full of Martyrs,
every chain would drag Martyrs, all that are executed with the sword would be crowned.
Therefore let the cause be distinguished; let none say, because I suffer, I am righteous. Because
He who first suffered, suffered for righteousness’ sake, therefore He added a great exception,
“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake.” For many having a good
cause do persecution, and many having a bad cause suffer persecution. For if persecution
could not be done rightly, it had not been said in a certain Psalm, “Whoso privily slandereth
his neighbour, him did I persecute.”805…Let none then say, I suffer persecution: let him
not sift the punishment, but prove the cause: lest if he prove not the cause, he be numbered
with the ungodly. Therefore how watchfully, how excellently hath This Man recommended
Himself, “O Lord, attend to My judgment,” not to My punishments; “even to My cause, My
God, and My Lord.”
25. “Judge me, O Lord, according to My righteousness” (ver. 24); that is, attend to My
cause. Not according to My punishment, but “according to My righteousness, O Lord, My
God,” that is, according to this judge Thou Me. “And let them not rejoice over Me;” that is,
Mine enemies.
26. “Let them not say in their heart, Aha, aha, so would we have it” (ver. 25); that is, We
have done what we could,806 we have slain him, we have taken him away. “Let them not
say:” show them that they have done nothing. “Let them not say, We have swallowed him
up.” Whence say those Martyrs, “If the Lord had not been on our side, then they had swal-
lowed us up quick.”807 What is, “had swallowed us up”? Had passed into their own body.
For that thou swallowest up, which thou passest into thy own body. The world would
swallow thee up; swallow thou the world, pass it into thy own body: kill and eat. As it was
said to Peter, “Kill and eat;”808 do thou kill in them what they are, make them what thou
art. But if they on the other hand persuade thee to ungodliness, thou art swallowed up by
them. Not when they persecute thee art thou swallowed up by them, but when they persuade

thee to be what they are. “Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.” Do thou swallow
up the body of Pagans. Why the body of Pagans? It would swallow thee up. Do thou to it,
what it would to thee. Therefore perhaps that calf, being ground to powder, was cast into
the water and given to the children of Israel to drink,809 that so the body of ungodliness
might be swallowed up by Israel. “Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together
that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour” (ver. 26); so that
we may swallow up them ashamed and brought to confusion. “Who speak evil against me:”
let them be ashamed, let them be brought to confusion.
27. What sayest thou now, the Head with the Members? “Let them shout for joy and be
glad that favour My righteous cause:” who cleave to My Body. Yea, let them say “continually,
Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of His servant” (ver. 27).
“And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness, and of Thy praise all the day long” (ver.
28). And whose tongue endureth to speak the praise of God all the day long? See now I have
made a discourse something longer; ye are wearied. Who endureth to praise God all the day
long? I will suggest a remedy, whereby thou mayest praise God all the day long if thou wilt.
Whatever thou dost, do well, and thou hast praised God. When thou singest an hymn, thou
praisest God, but what doth thy tongue, unless thy heart also praise Him? Hast thou ceased
from singing hymns, and departed, that thou mayest refresh thyself? Be not drunken, and
thou hast praised God. Dost thou go away to sleep? Rise not to do evil, and thou hast praised
God. Dost thou transact business? Do no wrong, and thou hast praised God. Dost thou till
thy field? Raise not strife, and thou hast praised God. In the innocency of thy works prepare
thyself to praise God all the day long.

Psalm XXXV
Psalm XXXVI.810
1. …“The ungodly hath said in himself that he will sin: there is no fear of God before
his eyes” (ver. 1). Not of one man, but of a race of ungodly men he speaketh, who fight
against their own selves, by not understanding, that so they may live well; not because they
cannot, but because they will not. For it is one thing, when one endeavours to understand
some thing, and through infirmity of flesh cannot; as saith the Scripture811 in a certain place,
“For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down
the mind that museth upon many things;” but another when the human heart acts mischiev-
ously against itself, so that what it could understand, if it had but good will thereto, it under-
standeth not, not because it is difficult, but because the will is contrary. But so it is when
men love their own sins, and hate God’s Commandments. For the Word of God is thy ad-
versary, if thou be a friend to thy ungodliness; but if thou art an adversary to thy ungodliness,
the Word of God is thy friend, as well as the adversary of thy ungodliness.…
2. “For he hath wrought deceitfully in His sight” (ver. 2). In whose sight? In His, whose
fear was not before the eyes of him that did work deceitfully. “To find out his iniquity, and
hate it.” He wrought so as not to find it. For there are men who as it were endeavour to seek
out their iniquity, and fear to find it; because if they should find it, it is said to them, Depart
from it: this thou didst before thou knewest; thou didst iniquity being in ignorance; God
giveth pardon: now thou hast discovered it, forsake it, that to thy ignorance pardon may
easily be given; and that with a clear face thou mayest say to God, “Remember not the sins
of my youth, and of my ignorance.”812 Thus he seeketh it, thus he feareth lest he find it; for
he seeketh it deceitfully. When saith a man, I knew not that it was sin? When he hath seen
that it is sin, and ceaseth to do the sin, which he did only because he was ignorant: such an
one in truth would know his sin, to find it out, and hate it. But now many “work deceitfully
to find out their iniquity:” they work not from their heart to find it out and hate it. But be-
cause in the very search after iniquity, there is deceit, in the finding it there will be defence
of it. For when one hath found his iniquity, lo now it is manifest to him that it is iniquity.
Do it not, thou sayest. And he who wrought deceitfully to find it out, now he hath found,
hateth it not; for what saith he? How many do this! Who is there that doth it not? And will
God destroy them all? Or at least he saith this: if God would not these things to be done,
would men live who commit the same? Seest thou that thou didst work deceitfully to find
out thy iniquity? For if not deceitfully but sincerely thou hadst wrought, thou wouldest now

Psalm XXXVI
have found it out, and hated it; now thou hast found it out, and thou defendest it; therefore
thou didst work deceitfully, when thou soughtest it.
3. “The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he would not understand, that he
might do good” (ver. 3). Ye see that he attributeth that to the will: for there are men who
would understand and cannot, and there are men who would not understand, and therefore
understand not. “He would not understand, that he might do good.”
4. “He hath meditated iniquity on his bed.” What said He, “On his bed?” (ver. 4). “The
ungodly hath said in himself, that he will sin:” what above he said, in himself, that here he
said, “On his bed.” Our bed is our heart: there we suffer the tossing of an evil conscience;
and there we rest when our conscience is good. Whoso loveth the bed of his heart, let him
do some good therein. There is our bed, where the Lord Jesus Christ commands us to pray.
“Enter into thy chamber, and shut thy door.”813 What is, “Shut thy door?” Expect not from
God such things as are without, but such as are within; “and thy Father which seeth in secret,
shall reward thee openly.” Who is he that shutteth not the door? He who asketh much from
God such things, and in such wise directeth all his prayers, that he may receive the goods
that are of this world. Thy door is open, the multitude seeth when thou prayest. What is it
to shut thy door? To ask that of God, which God alone knoweth how He giveth. What is
that for which thou prayest, when thou hast shut the door? What “eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard, or hath entered into the heart of man.”814 And haply it hath not entered into thy
very bed, that is, into thy heart. But God knoweth what He will give: but when shall it be?
When the Lord shall be revealed, when the Judge shall appear.…
5. “He hath set himself in every way that is not good.” What is, “he hath set himself”?
He hath sinned perseveringly. Whence also of a certain pious and good man it is said, “He
hath not stood in the way of sinners.”815 As this “hath not stood,” so that “hath set himself.”
“But wickedness hath he not hated.” There is the end, there the fruit: if a man cannot but
have wickedness, let him at least hate it. For when thou hatest it, it scarcely occurs to thee
to do any wickedness. For sin is in our mortal body, but what saith the Apostle? “Let not
sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.”816 When beginneth
it not to be therein? When that shall be fulfilled in us which he saith, “When this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality.”817 Before
this come to pass, there is a delighting in sin in the body, but greater is the delighting and
the pleasure in the Word of Wisdom, in the Commandment of God. Overcome sin and the

lust thereof. Sin and iniquity do thou hate, that thou mayest join thyself to God, who hateth
it as well as thou. Now being joined in mind unto the Law of God, in mind thou servest the
Law of God. And if in the flesh thou therefore servest818 the law of sin,819 because there are
in thee certain carnal delightings, then will there be none when thou shalt no longer fight.
It is one thing not to fight, and to be in true and lasting peace; another to fight and overcome;
another to fight and to be overcome; another not to fight at all, but to be carried away.…
6. “Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth even unto the clouds”
(ver. 5). I know not what Mercy of Him he meaneth, which is in the heavens. For the Mercy
of the Lord is also in the earth. Thou hast it written, “The earth is full of the Mercy of the
Lord.”820 Of what Mercy then speaketh He, when He saith, “Thy Mercy, O Lord, is in the
heavens”? The gifts of God are partly temporal and earthly, partly eternal and heavenly.
Whoso for this worshippeth God, that he may receive those temporal and earthly goods,
which are open to all, is still as it were like the brutes: he enjoyeth indeed the Mercy of God,
but not that which is excepted, which shall not be given, save only to the righteous, to the
holy, to the good. What are the gifts which abound to all? “He maketh His sun to rise on
the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”821 Who hath not
this Mercy of God, first that he hath being, that he is distinguished from the brutes, that he
is a rational animal, so as to understand God; secondly, that he enjoys this light, this air,
rain, fruits, diversity of seasons, and all the earthly comforts, health of body, the affection
of friends, the safety of his family? All these are good, and they are God’s gifts.…
7. But this man rightly understood what mercy he should pray for from God. “Thy
Mercy, O Lord, is in the Heavens; and Thy Truth reacheth even to the clouds.” That is, the
Mercy which Thou givest to Thy Saints, is Heavenly, not earthly; is Eternal, not temporal.
And how couldest Thou declare it unto men? Because “Thy Truth reacheth even unto the
clouds.” For who could know the Heavenly Mercy of God, unless God should declare it
unto men? How did He declare it? By sending His truth even unto the clouds. What are the
clouds? The Preachers of the Word of God.…Truth reached even to the clouds: therefore
unto us could be declared the Mercy of God, which is in Heaven and not in earth. And truly,
Brethren, the clouds are the Preachers of the Word of Truth. When God threateneth through
His Preachers, He thunders through the clouds. When God worketh miracles through His
Preachers, He lightneth through the clouds, He terrifieth through the clouds, and watereth
818 i.e., “art subject to it,” not “obeyest it.” He is not here speaking of actual wilful sin, but of motions toward
sin to which the man does not consent. [Concupiscence, art. ix. Angl. XXXIX. Articles.—C.]

by the rain. Those Preachers, then, by whom is preached the Gospel of God, are the clouds
of God. Let us then hope for Mercy, but for that which is in the Heavens.
8. “Thy Righteousness is like the mountains of God: Thy Judgments are a great deep”
(ver. 6). Who are the mountains of God? Those who are called clouds, the same are also the
mountains of God. The great Preachers are the mountains of God. And as when the sun
riseth, he first clothes the mountains with light, and thence the light descends to the lowest
parts of the earth: so our Lord Jesus Christ, when He came, first irradiated the height of the
Apostles, first enlightened the mountains, and so His Light descended to the valley of the
world. And therefore saith He in a certain Psalm, “I lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains,
from whence cometh my help.”822 But think not that the mountains themselves will give
thee help: for they receive what they may give, give not of their own. And if thou remain in
the mountains, thy hope will not be strong: but in Him who enlighteneth the mountains,
ought to be thy hope and presumption. Thy help indeed will come to thee through the
mountains, because the Scriptures are administered to thee through the mountains, through
the great Preachers of the Truth: but fix not thy hope in them. Hear what He saith next fol-
lowing: “I lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains, from whence cometh my help.” What
then? Do the mountains give thee help? No; hear what follows, “My help cometh from the
Lord, which made Heaven and earth.”823 Through the mountains cometh help, but not
from the mountains. From whom then? “From the Lord, which made Heaven and earth.”…
9. “Thy Judgments are like the great abyss.” The abyss he calleth the depth of sin,
whither every one cometh by despising God; as in a certain place it is said, “God gave them
over to their own hearts’ lusts, to do the things which are not convenient.”824…Because
then they were proud and ungrateful, they were held worthy to be delivered up to the lusts
of their own hearts, and became a great abyss, so that they not only sinned, but also worked
craftily, lest they should understand their iniquity, and hate it. That is the depth of wicked-
ness, to be unwilling to find it out and to hate it. But how one cometh to that depth, see;
“Thy Judgments are the great abyss.” As the mountains are by the Righteousness of God,
825 who through His Grace become great: so also through His Judgments come they unto
the depth, who sink lowest. By this then let the mountains delight thee, by this turn away
from the abyss, and turn thyself unto that, of which it is said, “My help cometh from the
Lord.” But whereby? “I have lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains.” What meaneth this?
I will speak plainly.826 In the Church of God thou findest an abyss, thou findest also

mountains; thou findest there but few good, because the mountains are few, the abyss broad;
that is, thou findest many living ill after the wrath of God, because they have so worked that
they are delivered up to the lusts of their own heart; so now they defend their sins and confess
them not; but say, Why? What have I done? Such an one did this, and such an one did that.
Now will they even defend what the Divine Word reproves. This is the abyss. Therefore in
a certain place827 saith the Scripture (hear this abyss), “The sinner when he cometh unto
the depth of sin despiseth.” See, “Thy Judgments are like the great abyss.” But yet not art
thou a mountain; not yet art thou in the abyss; fly from the abyss, tend towards the moun-
tains; but yet remain not on the mountains. “For thy help cometh from the Lord, which
made Heaven and earth.”
10. Because he said, Thy Mercy is in the Heavens, that it may be known to be also on
earth, he said, “O Lord, Thou savest man and beast,828 as Thy Mercy is multiplied, O God”
(ver. 7). Great is Thy Mercy, and manifold is Thy Mercy, O God; and that showest Thou
both to man and beast. For from whom is the saving of men? From God. Is not the saving
of beasts also from God? For He who made man, made also beasts; He who made both,
saveth both; but the saving of beasts is temporal. But there are who as a great thing ask this
of God, which He hath given to beasts. “Thy Mercy, O God, is multiplied,” so that not only
unto men, but unto beasts also is given the same saving which is given to men, a carnal and
temporal saving.
11. Have not men then somewhat reserved with God, which beasts deserve not, and
whereunto beasts arrive not? They have evidently. And where is that which they have. “The
children of men put their trust under the shadow of Thy wings.” Attend, my Beloved, to
this most pleasant sentence; “Thou savest man and beast.” First, he spake of “man and beast,”
then of “the children of men;” as though “men” were one, “the children of men” other.
Sometimes in Scripture children of men is said generally of all men, sometimes in some
proper manner, with some proper signification, so that not all men are understood; chiefly
when there is a distinction. For not without reason is it here put; “O Lord, Thou savest man
and beast: but the children of men;” as though setting aside the first, he keepeth separate
the children of men. Separate from whom? Not only from beasts, but also from men, who
seek from God the saving of beasts, and desire this as a great thing. Who then are the children
of men? Those who put their trust under the shadow of His wings. For those men together
with beasts rejoice in possession, but the children of men rejoice in hope: those follow after
present goods with beasts, these hope for future goods with Angels.…

12. “They shall be satiated829 with the fulness of Thy House” (ver. 8). He promiseth us
some great thing. He would speak it, and He speaketh it not. Can He not, or do not we receive
it? I dare, my Brethren, to say, even of holy tongues and hearts, by which Truth is declared
to us, that it can neither be spoken, which they declared, nor even thought of. For it is a
great thing, and ineffable; and even they saw through a glass darkly, as saith the Apostle,
“For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face.”830 Lo, they who saw through
a glass darkly, thus burst forth. What then shall we be, when we shall see face to face? That
with which they travailed in heart, and could not with their tongue bring forth, that men
might receive it. For what necessity was there that he should say, “They shall be satiated
with the fulness of Thy House”? He sought a word whereby to express from human things
what he would say; and because he saw that men drowning themselves in drunkenness receive
indeed wine without measure, but lose their senses, he saw what to say; for when shall have
been received that ineffable joy, then shall be lost in a manner the human soul, it shall become
Divine, and be satiated with the fulness of God’s House. Wherefore also in another Psalm
it is said, “Thy cup inebriating, how excellent is it!”831 With this cup were the Martyrs satiated
when going to their passion, they knew not their own. What so inebriated as not to know
a wife weeping, not children, not parents? They knew them not, they thought not that they
were before their eyes. Wonder not: they were inebriated. Wherewith were they so? Lo, they
had received a cup wherewith they were satiated. Wherefore he also gives thanks to God,
saying, “What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits towards me? I will take the
cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord.”832 Therefore, Brethren of men, let
us be children and let us trust under the shadow of His wings and be satiated with the fulness
of His House. As I could, I have spoken; and as far as I can I see; and how far I see, I cannot
speak.833 “And of the torrent of Thy Pleasure shalt Thou give them to drink.” A torrent we
call water coming with a flood. There will be a flood of God’s Mercy to overflow and inebriate
those who now put their trust under the shadow of His wings. What is that Pleasure? As it
were a torrent inebriating the thirsty. Let him then who thirsts now, lay up hope: whoso
thirsts now, let him have hope; when inebriated, he shall have possession: before he have

Psalm XXXVI
possession, let him thirst in hope. “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after right-
eousness, for they shall be filled.”834
13. With what fountain then wilt thou be overflowed, and whence runneth such a torrent
of His Pleasure? “For with Thee,” saith he, “is the fountain of Life.” What is the fountain of
Life, but Christ? He came to thee in the flesh, that He might bedew thy thirsty lips: He will
satisfy thee trusting, who bedewed thee thirsting. “For with Thee is the fountain of Life; in
Thy Light shall we see light” (ver. 9). Here a fountain is one thing, light another: there not
so. For that which is the Fountain, the same is also Light: and whatever thou wilt thou callest
It, for It is not what thou callest It: for thou canst not find a fit name: for It remaineth not
in one name. If thou shouldest say, that It is Light only, it would be said to thee, Then without
cause am I told to hunger and thirst, for who is there that eateth light? It is said to me plainly,
directly, “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”835 If It is Light, my eyes must
I prepare. Prepare also lips; for That which is Light is also a Fountain: a Fountain, because
It satisfieth the thirsty: Light, because It enlighteneth the blind. Here sometimes, light is in
one place, a fountain in another. For sometimes fountains run even in darkness; and
sometimes in the desert thou sufferest the sun, findest no fountain: here then can these two
be separated: there thou shalt not be wearied, for there is a Fountain; there thou shalt not
be darkened, for there is Light.
14. “Show forth Thy Mercy unto them that know Thee; Thy Righteousness to them that
are of a right heart” (ver. 10). As I have said, Those are of a right heart who follow in this
life the Will of God. The will of God is sometimes that thou shouldest be whole, sometimes
that thou shouldest be sick. If when thou art whole God’s Will be sweet, and when thou art
sick God’s Will be bitter; thou art not of a right heart. Wherefore? Because thou wilt not
make right thy will according to God’s Will, but wilt bend God’s Will to thine. That is right,
but thou art crooked: thy will must be made right to That, not That made crooked to thee;
and thou wilt have a right heart. It is well with thee in this world; be God blessed, who
comforteth thee: it goeth hardly with thee in this world; be God blessed, because He836
chasteneth and proveth thee; and so wilt thou be of a right heart, saying, “I will bless the
Lord at all times: His Praise shall be ever in my mouth.”837
15. “Let not the foot of pride come against me” (ver. 11). But now he said, The children
of men shall put their trust under the shadow of Thy wings: they shall be satiated with the
fulness of Thy House. When one hath begun to be plentifully overflowed with that Fountain,
let him take heed lest he grow proud. For the same was not wanting to Adam, the first man:
834 Matt. v. 6.

836 Al. “Who.”
837 Ps. xxxiv. 1.
Psalm XXXVI
but the foot of pride came against him, and the hand of the sinner removed him, that is, the
proud hand of the devil. As he who seduced him, said of himself, “I will sit in the sides of
the north;”838 so he persuaded him, by saying, “Taste, and ye shall be as gods.”839 By pride
then have we so fallen as to arrive at this mortality. And because pride had wounded us,
humility maketh us whole. God came humbly, that from such great wound of pride He
might heal man. He came, for “The Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us.”840 He was
taken by the Jews; He was reviled of them. Ye heard when the Gospel was read, what they
said, and to Whom they said, “Thou hast a devil:”841 and He said not, Ye have a devil, for
ye are still in your sins, and the devil possesseth your hearts. He said not this, which if He
had said, He had said truly: but it was not meet that He should say it, lest He should seem
not to preach Truth, but to retort evil speaking. He let go what He heard as though He heard
it not. For a Physician was He, and to cure the madman had He come. As a Physician careth
not what he may hear from the madman; but how the madman may recover and become
sane; nor even if he receive a blow from the madman, careth he; but while he to him giveth
new wounds, he cureth his old fever: so also the Lord came to the sick man, to the madman
came He, that whatever He might hear, whatever He might suffer, He should despise; by
this very thing teaching us humility, that being taught by humility, we might be healed from
pride: from which he here prayeth to be delivered, saying, “Let not the foot of pride come
against me; neither let the hand of the sinner remove me.” For if the foot of pride come, the
hand of the sinner removeth. What is the hand of the sinner? The working of him that ad-
viseth ill. Hast thou become proud? Quickly he corrupteth thee who adviseth ill. Humbly
fix thyself in God, and care not much what is said to thee. Hence is that which is elsewhere
spoken, “From my secret sins cleanse Thou me; and from others’ sins also keep Thy ser-
vant.”842 What is, “From my secret sins”? “Let not the foot of pride come against me.” What
is, “From other men’s sins also keep Thy servant”? “Let not the hand of the wicked remove
me.” Keep that which is within, and thou shalt not fear from without.
16. But wherefore so greatly fearest thou this? Because it is said, “Thereby have fallen
all that work iniquity” (ver. 12); so that they have come into that abyss of which it is said,
“Thy judgments are like the great abyss:” so that they have come even to that deep wherein
sinners who despise have fallen. “Have fallen.” Whereby did they first fall? By the foot of
pride. Hear the foot of pride. “When they knew God, they glorified Him not as God.”
Therefore came against them the foot of pride, whereby they came into the depth. “God

gave them over to their own hearts’ lusts, to do those things which are not convenient.”843
The root of sin, and the head of sin feared he who said, “Let not the foot of pride come
against me.” Wherefore said he, “the foot”? Because by walking proudly man deserted God,
and departed from Him. His foot, called he his affection. “Let not the foot of pride come
against me: let not the hand of the wicked remove me:” that is, let not the works of the
wicked remove me from Thee, that I should wish to imitate them. But wherefore said he
this against pride, “Thereby have fallen all that work iniquity”? Because those who now are
ungodly, have fallen by pride. Therefore when the Lord would caution His Church, He said,
“It shall watch thy head, and thou shalt watch844 his heel.”845 The serpent watcheth when
the foot of pride may come against thee, when thou mayest fall, that he may cast thee down.
But watch thou his head: the beginning of all sin is pride.846 “Thereby have fallen all that
work iniquity: they are driven out, and are not able to stand.” He first, who in the Truth
stood not, then, through him, they whom God sent out of Paradise. Whence he, the humble,
who said that he was not worthy to unloose His shoe’s latchet, is not driven out, but standeth
and heareth Him, and rejoiceth greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice;847 not because
of his own, lest the foot of pride come against him, and he be driven out, and be not able to
stand.…

Psalm XXXVI
Psalm XXXVII.848
On the first part of the psalm.
1. With terror do they hear of the coming of the last day, who will not be secure by living
well: and who fain would live ill, long. But it was for useful purposes that God willed that
day to remain unknown; that the heart may be ever ready to expect that of which it knows
it is to come, but knows not when it is to come. Seeing, however, that our Lord Jesus Christ
was sent to us to be our “Master,”849 He said, that “of the day not even the Son of Man
knew,”850 because it was not part of His office as our Master that through Him it should
become known to us. For indeed the Father knoweth nothing that the Son knoweth not;
since that is the Very Knowledge of the Father Itself, which is His Wisdom; now His Son,
His Word, is “His Wisdom.” But because it was not for our good to know that, which however
was known to Him who came indeed to teach us, though not to teach us that which it was
not good for us to know, He not only, as a Master, taught us something, but also, as a Master,
left something untaught. For, as a Master, He knew how both to teach us what was good
for us, and not to teach us what was injurious. Now thus, according to a certain form of
speech, the Son851 is said not to know what He does not teach: that is, in the same way that
we are daily in the habit of speaking, He is said not to know what He causes us not to
know.852…
2. This it is that disturbs you who are a Christian; that you see men of bad lives
prospering, and surrounded with abundance of things like these; you see them sound in
health, distinguished with proud honours; you see their family unvisited by misfortune; the
happiness of their relatives, the obsequious attendance of their dependants, their most
commanding influence, their life uninterrupted by any sad event; you see their characters
most profligate, their external resources most affluent; and your heart says that there is no
Divine judgment; that all things are carried to and fro by accidents, and blown about in
disorderly and irregular motions. For if God, thou sayest, regarded human affairs, would
his iniquity flourish, and my innocence suffer? Every sickness of the soul hath in Scripture

noticed that in the life of St. Fulgentius, c. 3, we are told that, “having some time before resolved with himself
to renounce the world, he was so roused and moved by St. Augustin’s exposition of this Psalm that he determined
to make his vow public, and earnestly desired to adopt the religious habit.”—Ben.

its proper remedy. Let him then whose sickness is of that kind that he says in his heart things
like these, let him drink this Psalm by way of potion.…
3. “Be not envious because of evil-doers, neither be envious against the workers of
iniquity” (ver. 1). “For they shall soon wither like the grass, and shall fade like the herbs of
the meadow” (ver. 2). That which to thee seemeth long, is “soon” in the sight of God. Con-
form853 thou thyself to God; and it will be “soon” to thee. That which he here calls “grass,”
that we understand by the “herbs of the meadow.” They are some worthless things, occupying
the surface only of the ground, they have no depth of root. In the winter then they are green;
but when the summer sun shall begin to scorch, they will wither away. For now it is the
season of winter. Thy glory doth not as yet appear. But if thy love hath but a deep root, like
that of many trees during winter, the frost passes away, the summer (that is, the Day of
Judgment) will come; then will the greenness of the grass wither away. Then will the glory
of the trees appear. “For ye” (saith the Apostle) “are dead,”854 even as trees seem to be in
winter, as it were dead, as it were withered. What is our hope then, if we are dead? The root
is within; where our root is, there is our life also, for there our love is fixed. “And your life
is hid with Christ in God.”855 When shall he wither who is thus rooted? But when will our
spring be? When our summer? When will the honour of foliage clothe us around, and the
fulness of fruit make us rich? When shall this come to pass? Hear what follows: “When
Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.” And what
then shall we do now? “Be not envious because of the evil-doers, neither be envious against
the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon wither like the grass, and fade like the herb of
the meadow.”
4. What shouldest thou do then? “Trust in the Lord” (ver. 3). For they too trust, but not
“in the Lord.” Their hope is perishable. Their hope is short-lived, frail, fleeting, transitory,
baseless. “Trust thou in the Lord.” “Behold,” thou sayest, “I do trust; what am I to do?”
“And do good.” Do not do that evil which thou beholdest in those men, who are pros-
perous in wickedness. “Do good, and dwell in the land.” Lest haply thou shouldest be doing
good without “dwelling in the land.” For it is the Church that is the Lord’s land. It is her
whom He, the Father, the tiller of it, waters and cultivates. For there are many that, as it
were, do good works, but yet, in that they do not “dwell in the land,” they do not belong to
the husbandman. Therefore do thou thy good, not outside of the land, but do thou “dwell
in the land.” And what shall I have?
“And thou shalt be fed in its riches.” What are the riches of that land? Her riches are
her Lord! Her riches are her God! He it is to whom it is said, “The Lord is the portion of
853 Subjunge.
854 Col. iii. 3.
855 Col. iii. 3.
Part 1
mine inheritance, and of my cup.”856 In a late discourse we suggested to you, dearly beloved,
that God is our possession,857 and that we are at the same time God’s possession. Hear how
that He is Himself the riches of that land.
“Delight thyself in the Lord” (ver. 4). As if thou hadst put the question, and hadst said
“Show me the riches of that land, in which thou biddest me dwell,” he says, “Delight thyself
in the Lord.”
5. “And He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.” Understand in their proper signi-
fication,858 “the desires of thine heart.” Distinguish the “desires of thine heart” from the
desires of thy flesh; distinguish as much as thou canst. It is not without a meaning that it is
said in a certain Psalm, “God is” (the strength) “of mine heart.” For there it says in what
follows: “And God is my portion for ever.” For instance: One labours under bodily blindness.
He asks that he may receive his sight. Let him ask it; for God does that too, and gives those
blessings also. But these things are asked for even by the wicked. This is a desire of the flesh.
One is sick, and prays to be made sound. From the point of death he is restored to health.
That too is a desire of the flesh, as are all of such a kind. What is “the desire of the heart”?
As the desire of the flesh is to wish to have one’s eyesight restored, to enable him, that is, to
see that light, which can be seen by such eyes; so “the desire of the heart” relates to a different
sort of light. For, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Delight thou thyself
in the Lord; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.”
6. “Behold” (you say), “I do long after it, I do ask for it, I do desire it. Shall I then accom-
plish it?” No. Who shall then? “Reveal thy way unto the Lord: trust also in Him, and He
shall bring it to pass” (ver. 5). Mention to Him what thou sufferest, mention to Him what
thou dost desire. For what is it that thou sufferest? “The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and
the spirit against the flesh.” 859 What is it then that thou dost desire? “Wretched man that
I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”860 And because it is He “Himself”
that “will bring it to pass,” when thou shalt have “revealed thy ways unto Him;” hear what
follows: “The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” What is it then that He is to
bring to pass, since it is said, “Reveal thy way unto Him, and He will bring it to pass”? What
will He bring to pass?
“And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light” (ver. 6). For now, “thy right-
eousness” is hid. Now it is a thing of faith; not yet of sight. You believe something that you
may do it. You do not yet see that in which you believe. But when thou shalt begin to see

Part 1
that, which thou didst believe before, “thy righteousness will be brought forth to the light,”
because it is thy faith that was861 thy righteousness. For “the just lives by faith.”
7. “And He shall bring forth thy judgment as the noon-day.” That is to say, “as the clear
light.” It was too little to say, “as the light.” For we call it “light” already, even when it but
dawns: we call it light even while the sun is rising. But never is the light brighter than at
mid-day. Therefore He will not only “bring forth thy righteousness as the light,” but “thy
judgment shall be as the noon-day.” For now dost thou make thy “judgment” to follow
Christ. This is thy purpose: this is thy choice: this is thy “judgment.”…
8. “What should I do then?” Hear what thou shouldest do. “Submit thee to the Lord,
and entreat Him” (ver. 7). Be this thy life, to obey His commandments. For this is to submit
thee to Him; and to entreat Him until He give thee what He hath promised. Let good works
“continue;”862 let prayer “continue.” For “men ought always to pray, and not to faint.”863
Wherein dost thou show that thou art “submitted to Him”? In doing what He hath com-
manded. But haply thou dost not receive thy wages as yet, because as yet thou art not able.
For He is already able to give them; but thou art not already able to receive them. Exercise
thou thyself in works. Labour in the vineyard; at the close of the day crave thy wages.
“Faithful is He” who brought thee into the vineyard. “Submit thee to the Lord, and entreat
Him.”
9. “See! I do so; I do ‘submit to the Lord, and I do entreat.’ But what do you think? That
neighbour of mine is a wicked man, living a bad life, and prosperous! His thefts, adulteries,
robberies, are known to me. Lifted up above every one, proud, and raised on high by
wickedness, he deigns not to notice me. In these circumstances, how shall I hold out with
patience?” This is a sickness; drink, by way of remedy. “Fret not thyself because of him who
prospereth in his way.” He prospereth, but it is “in his way:” thou sufferest, but it is in God’s
way! His portion is prosperity on his way, misery on arriving at its end: yours, toil on the
road, happiness in its termination. “The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; and the
way of the ungodly shall perish.”864 Thou walkest those ways which “the Lord knoweth,”
and if thou dost suffer toil in them, they do not deceive thee. The “way of the ungodly” is
but a transitory happiness; at the end of the way the happiness is at an end also. Why? Because
that way is “the broad road;” its termination leads to the pit of hell. Now, thy way is narrow;
and “few there be” that enter in through it:865 but into how ample a field it comes at the
861 Al. “shall be.”

last, thou oughtest to consider. “Fret not thyself at him who prospereth in his way; because
of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.”
“Cease from anger, and forsake wrath” (ver. 8). Wherefore art thou wroth? Wherefore
is it that, through that passion and indignation, thou dost blaspheme, or almost blaspheme?
Against “the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass, cease from anger, and forsake wrath.”
Knowest thou not whither that wrath tempts thee on? Thou art on the point of saying unto
God, that He is unjust. It tends to that. “Look! why is that man prosperous, and this man
in adversity?” Consider what thought it begets: stifle the wicked notion. “Cease from anger,
and forsake wrath:” so that now returning to thy senses, thou mayest say, “Mine eye is dis-
turbed because of wrath.”866 What eye is that, but the eye of faith? To the eye of thy faith I
appeal.867 Thou didst believe in Christ: why didst thou believe? What did He promise thee?
If it was the happiness of this world that Christ promised thee, then murmur against Christ;
yes! murmur against Him, when thou seest the wicked flourishing. What of happiness did
He promise? What, save in the Resurrection of the Dead? But what in this life? That which
was His portion. His portion, I say! Dost thou, servant and disciple, disdain what thy Lord,
what thy Master bore?…
“For evil-doers shall be cut off” (ver. 9). “But I see their prosperity.” Believe Him who
saith, “they shall be cut off;” Him who seeth better than thou, since His eye anger cannot
cloud. “For evil-doers shall be cut off. But those that wait upon the Lord,”—not upon any
one that can deceive them; but verily on Him who is the Truth itself,—“But those that wait
upon the Lord, they shall inherit the land.” What “land,” but that Jerusalem, with the love
of which whosoever is inflamed, shall come to peace at the last.
10. “But how long is the sinner to flourish? How long shall I have to endure?” Thou art
impatient;868 that which seems long to thee, will soon come to pass. It is infirmity makes
that seem long, which is really short, as is found in the case of the longings of sick men.
Nothing seems so long as the mixing of the potion for him when athirst. For all that his at-
tendants are making all speed, lest haply the patient be angry; “When will it be done? (he
cries). When will it be drest? When will it be served?” Those who are waiting upon you are
making haste, but your infirmity fancies that long which is being done with expedition.
Behold ye, therefore, our Physician complying with the infirmity of the patient, saying,
“How long shall I have to endure? How long will it be?”
“Yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be” (ver. 10). Is it certainly among sinners,
and because of the sinner, that thou murmurest? “A little while, and he shall not be.” Lest
haply because I said, “They that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the land,” thou
866 Ps. vi. 7.
867 Interrogo.
868 Festinas.
Part 1
shouldest think that waiting to be of very long duration. Wait “a little while,” thou shalt re-
ceive without end what thou waitest for. A little while, a moderate space. Review the years
from Adam’s time up to this day; run through the Scriptures. It is almost yesterday that he
fell from Paradise! So many ages have been measured out, and unrolled.869 Where now are
the past ages? Even so, however, shall the few which remain, pass away also. Hadst thou
been living throughout all that time, since Adam was banished from Paradise up to this
present day, thou wouldest certainly see that the life, which had thus flown away, had not
been of long duration. But how long is the duration of each individual’s life? Add any
number of years you please: prolong old age to its longest duration: what is it? Is it not but
a morning breeze? Be it so, however, that the Day of Judgment is far off, when the reward
of the righteous and of the unrighteous is to come: your last day at all events cannot be far
off. Make thyself ready against this! For such as thou shall have departed from this life, shalt
thou be restored to the other. At the close of that short life, you will not yet be, where the
Saints shall be, to whom it shall be said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father: inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the beginning of the world.”870 You will not yet be there? Who does
not know that? But you may already be there, where that beggar, once “covered with sores,”
was seen at a distance, at rest, by that proud and unfruitful “rich man” in the midst of his
torments.871 Surely hid in that rest thou waitest in security for the Day of Judgment, when
thou art to receive again a body, to be changed so as to be made equal to an Angel. How
long then is that for which we are impatient, and are saying, “When will it come? Will it
tarry long?” This our sons will say hereafter, and our sons’ sons will say too; and, though
each one of these in succession will say this same thing, that “little while” that is yet to be,
passes away, as all that is already past hath passed away already! O thou sick one! “Yet a
little while, and the sinner shall not be. Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and
thou shalt not find him.”…
11. “But the meek shall inherit the land”872 (ver. 11). That land is the one of which we
have often spoken, the holy Jerusalem, which is to be released from these her pilgrimages,
and to live for ever with God, and on God. Therefore, “They shall inherit the land.” What

On the Second Part of the Psalm.873
1. Then follow these words: “The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon
him with his teeth” (ver. 12): “But the Lord shall laugh at him” (ver. 13). At whom? Surely
at the sinner, “gnashing upon” the other “with his teeth.” But wherefore shall the Lord “laugh
at him”? “For He foreseeth that his day is coming.” He seems indeed full of wrath, while,
ignorant of the morrow that is in store for him, he is threatening the just. But the Lord be-
holds and “foresees his day.” “What day?” That in which “He will render to every man ac-
cording to his works.” For he is “treasuring up unto himself wrath against the day of wrath,
and revelation of the just judgment of God.”874 But it is the Lord that foresees it; thou dost
not foresee it. It hath been revealed to thee by Him who foresees it. Thou didst not know of
the “day of the unrighteous,” in which he is to suffer punishment. But He who knows it hath
revealed it to thee. It is a main part of knowledge to join thyself to Him who hath knowledge.
He hath the eyes of knowledge: have thou the eyes of a believing mind. That which God
“sees,” be thou willing to believe. For the day of the unjust, which God foresees, will come.
What day is that? The day for all vengeance! For it is necessary that vengeance should be
taken upon the ungodly, that vengeance be taken upon the unjust, whether he turn, or
whether he turn not. For if he shall turn from his ways, that very thing, that his “injustice
is come to an end,” is the infliction of vengeance.…
2. “The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the
poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright heart” (ver. 14). “Their weapon shall enter
into their own heart” (ver. 15). It is an easy thing for his weapon, that is, his sword, to reach
thy body, even as the sword of the persecutors reached the body of the Martyrs, but when
the body had been smitten, “the heart” remained unhurt; but his heart who “drew out the
sword against” the body of the just did not clearly remain unhurt. This is attested by this
very Psalm. It saith, Their weapon, that is, “Their sword shall,” not go into their body, but,
“their weapon shall go into their own heart.” They would fain have slain him in the body.
Let them die the death of the soul. For those whose bodies they sought to kill, the Lord hath
freed from anxiety, saying, “Fear not them who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul.”875…
3. “And their bows shall be broken.” What is meant by, “And their bows shall be broken”?
Their plots shall be frustrated. For above He had said, “The wicked have drawn out the
sword and bent their bows.” By the “drawing out of the sword” he would have understood
open hostility; but by the“ bending of the bow,” secret conspiracies. See! His sword destroys
himself, and his laying of snares is frustrated. What is meant by frustrated? That it does no
mischief to the righteous. How then, for instance (you ask), did it do no mischief to the
873 Preached at another time.

Part 2
man, whom it thus stripped of his goods, whom it reduced to straitened circumstances by
taking away his possessions? He has still cause to sing, “A little that a righteous man hath,
is better than great riches of the ungodly” (ver. 16).
4. …“For the arms of the wicked shall be broken” (ver. 17). Now by “their arms” is
meant their power. What will he do in hell? Will it be what the rich man had to do, he who
was wont “to fare sumptuously” in the upper world, and in hell “was tormented”?876
Therefore their arms shall be broken; “but the Lord upholdeth the righteous.” How does
He “uphold” them? What saith He unto them? Even what is said in another Psalm, “Wait
on the Lord, be of good courage; and let thine heart be strengthened. Wait, I say, on the
Lord.”877 What is meant by this, “Wait on the Lord”? Thou sufferest but for a time; thou
shalt rest for ever: thy trouble is short; thy happiness is to be everlasting. It is but for “a little
while” thou art to sorrow; thy joy shall have no end. But in the midst of trouble does thy
“foot” begin to “slip”? The example even of Christ’s sufferings is set before thee. Consider
what He endured for thee, in whom no cause was found why He should endure it? How
great soever be thy sufferings, thou wilt not come to those insults, those scourgings, to that
robe of shame, to that crown of thorns, and last of all to that Cross, which He endured; be-
cause that is now removed from the number of human punishments.878 For though under
the ancients criminals were crucified, in the present day no one is crucified. It was honoured,
and it came to an end. It came to an end as a punishment; it is continued in glory. It hath
removed from the place of execution to the foreheads of Emperors. He who hath invested
His very sufferings with such honour, what doth He reserve for His faithful servants?…
5. But observe whether that was fulfilled in his case which the Psalm now speaks of.
“The Lord strengtheneth the righteous.—Not only so” (saith that same Paul, whilst suffering
many evils), “but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience,
and patience experience; and experience hope; but hope maketh not ashamed, because the
love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.” 879
Justly is it said by him, now righteous, now “strengthened.” As therefore those who persecuted
him did no harm to him, when now “strengthened,” so neither did he himself do any harm
to those whom he persecuted. “But the Lord,” he saith, “strengtheneth the righteous.”…
6. Therefore “the Lord does strengthen the righteous.” In what way does He strengthen
them? “The Lord knoweth the ways880 of the spotless ones” (ver. 18). When they suffer ills,

they are believed to be walking ill ways by those who are ignorant, by those who have not
knowledge to discern “the ways of the spotless ones.” He who “knoweth those ways,” knoweth
by what way to lead His own, “them that are gentle,” in the right way. Whence in another
Psalm he said, “The meek shall He guide in judgment; them that are gentle will He teach
His way.”881 How, think you, was that beggar, who lay covered with sores before the rich
man’s door,882 spurned by the passers by! How did they, probably, close their nostrils and
spit at him! The Lord, however, knew how to reserve883 Paradise for him. How did they,
on the other hand, desire for themselves the life of him who was “clad in purple and fine
linen, and fared sumptuously every day!”884 But the Lord, who foresaw that man’s “day
coming,” knew the torments, the torments without end, that were in store for him. Therefore
“The Lord knoweth the ways of the upright.”
7. “And their inheritance shall be for ever” (ver. 18). This we hold by faith. Doth the
Lord too know it by faith? The Lord knoweth those things with as clear a manifestation, as
we cannot speak of even when we shall be made equal to the Angels. For the things that
shall be manifest to us, shall not be equally manifest to us as they are now to Him, who is
incapable of change. Yet even of us ourselves what is said? “Beloved, now are we the sons
of God: and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear,
we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.”885 There is therefore surely some
blissful vision reserved for us; and if it can be now in some measure conceived, “darkly and
through a glass,”886 yet cannot we in any way express in language the ravishing beauty of
that bliss, which God reserves for them that fear Him, which He consummates in those that
hope in Him. It is for that destination that our hearts are being disciplined in all the troubles
and trials of this life. Wonder not that it is in trouble that thou art disciplined for it. It is for
something glorious that thou art being disciplined. Whence comes that speech of the now
strengthened righteous man: “The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us”?887 What is that promised glory to be,
but to be made equal to the Angels and to see God? How great a benefit doth he bestow on
the blind man, who makes his eyes sound so as to be able to see the light of this life.…What
reward then shall we give unto that Physician who restores soundness to our inward eyes,
to enable them to see a certain eternal Light, which is Himself?…

8. “They shall not be ashamed in the evil time” (ver. 19). In the day of trouble, in the
day of distress, they shall not be “ashamed,” as he is ashamed whose hope deceives him.
Who is the man that is “ashamed”? He who saith, “I have not found that which I was in
hopes of.” Nor undeservedly either; for thou didst hope it from thyself or from man, thy
friend. But “cursed is he that putteth his trust in man.”888 Thou art ashamed, because thy
hope hath deceived thee; thy hope that was set on a lie. For “every man is a liar.”889 But if
thou dost place thy hopes on thy God, thou art not made “ashamed.” For He in whom thou
hast put thy trust, cannot be deceived.890 Whence also the man whom we mentioned just
above, the now “strengthened” righteous man, when fallen on an evil time, on the day of
tribulation, what saith he to show that he was not “ashamed”? “We glory in tribulation;
knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope;
but hope maketh not ashamed.” Whence is it that hope “maketh not ashamed”? Because it
is placed on God. Therefore follows immediately, “Because the love of God is spread in our
hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us.”891 The Holy Spirit hath been given to us
already: how should He deceive us, of whom we possess such an “earnest” already? “They
shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.”…
9. “For the wicked shall perish. But the enemies of the Lord, when they shall begin to
glory, and to be lifted up, immediately shall consume away utterly, even as the smoke” (ver.
20). Recognise from the comparison itself the thing which he intimates. Smoke, breaking
forth from the place where fire has been, rises up on high, and by the very act of rising up,
it swells into a large volume: but the larger that volume is, the more unsubstantial does it
become; for from that very largeness of volume, which has no foundation or consistency,
but is merely loose, shifting and evanescent, it passes into air, and dissolves; so that you
perceive its very largeness to have been fatal to it. For the higher it ascends, the farther it is
extended, the wider the circumference which it spreads itself over, the thinner, and the more
rare and wasting and evanescent does it become. “But the enemies of the Lord, when they
shall begin to glory, and to be lifted up, immediately shall consume away utterly even as the
smoke.” Of such as these was it said, “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these
also resist the Truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.”892 But how is
it that they resist the Truth, except by the vain inflation of their swelling pride, while they
raise themselves up on high, as if great and righteous persons, though on the point of passing
away into empty air? But what saith he of them? As if speaking of smoke, he says, “They

Part 2
shall proceed no farther, for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, even as theirs also
was.”…
10. “The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again” (ver. 20). He receiveth, and will not
repay. What is it he will not repay? Thanksgiving. For what is it that God would have of
thee, what doth He require of thee, except that He may do thee good? And how great are
the benefits which the sinner hath received, and which he will not repay! He hath received
the gift of being; he hath received the gift of being a man; and of a being highly distinguished
above the brutes; he hath received the form of a body, and the distinction of the senses in
the body, eyes for seeing, ears for hearing, the nostrils for smelling, the palate for tasting,
the hands for touching, and the feet for walking; and even the very health and soundness
of the body. But up to this point we have these things in common even with the brute; he
hath received yet more than this; a mind capable of understanding, capable of Truth, capable
of distinguishing right from wrong; capable of seeking after, of longing for, its Creator, of
praising Him, and fixing itself upon Him. All this the wicked man hath received as well as
others; but by not living well, he fails to repay that which he owes. Thus it is, “the wicked
borroweth, and payeth not again:” he will not requite Him from whom he hath received;
he will not return thanks; nay, he will even render evil for good, blasphemies, murmuring
against God, indignation. Thus it is that he “borroweth, and payeth not again; but the
righteous showeth mercy, and lendeth” (ver. 21). The one therefore hath nothing; the other
hath. See, on the one side, destitution: see, on the other, wealth. The one receiveth and
“payeth not again:” the “other showeth mercy, and lendeth:” and he hath more than enough.
What if he is poor? Even so he is rich; do you but look at his riches with the eyes of Religion.
For thou lookest at the empty chest; but dost not look at the conscience, that is full of God.…
11. “For such as shall bless Him893 shall inherit the land” (ver. 23), that is,894 they shall
possess that righteous One: the only One who both is truly righteous, and maketh righteous:
who both was poor in this world, and brought great riches to it, wherewith to make those
rich whom He found poor. For it is He who hath enriched the hearts of the poor with the
Holy Spirit; and having emptied out their souls by confession of sins, hath filled them with
the richness of righteousness: He who was able to enrich the fisherman, who, by forsaking
his nets, spurned what he possessed already, but sought to draw up what he possessed not.
For “God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are
mighty.”895 And it was not by an orator that He gained to Himself the fisherman; but by
the fisherman that He gained to Himself the orator; by the fisherman that He gained the
Senator; by the fisherman that He gained the Emperor. For “such as shall bless Him shall

Part 2
inherit the land;” they shall be fellow-heirs with Him, in that “land of the living,” of which
it is said in another Psalm, “Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.”896…
12. Observe what follows: “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he
delighteth in His way” (ver. 23). That man may himself “delight in the Lord’s way,” his steps
are ordered by the Lord Himself. For if the Lord did not order the steps of man, so crooked
are they naturally, that they would always be going through crooked paths, and by pursuing
crooked ways, would be unable to return again. He however came, and called us, and re-
deemed us, and shed His blood; He hath given this ransom; He hath done this good, and
suffered these evils. Consider Him in what He hath done, He is God! Consider Him in what
He hath suffered, He is Man! Who is that God-Man? Hadst not thou, O man, forsaken God,
God would not have been made Man for thee! For that was too little for thee to requite, or
for Him to bestow, that He had made thee man; unless He Himself should become Man for
thee also. For it is He Himself that hath “ordered our steps;” that we should “delight in His
way.”…
13. Now if man were to be through the whole of his life in toil, and in sufferings, in pain,
in tortures, in prison, in scourgings, in hunger, and in thirst, every day and every hour
through the whole length of life, to the period of old age, yet the whole life of man is but a
few days. That labour being over, there is to come the Eternal Kingdom; there is to come
happiness without end; there is to come equality with the Angels; there is to come Christ’s
inheritance, and Christ, our “joint Heir,”897 is to come. How great is the labour, for which
thou receivest so great a recompense? The Veterans who serve in the wars, and move in the
midst of wounds for so many years, enter upon the military service from their youth, and
quit it in old age: and to obtain a few days of repose in their old age, when age itself begins
to weigh down those whom the wars do not break down, how great hardships do they endure;
what marches, what frosts, what burning suns; what privations, what wounds, and what
dangers! And while suffering all these things, they fix their thoughts on nothing but those
few days of repose in old age, at which they know not whether they will ever arrive. Thus it
is, the “steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in His way.” This is
the point with which I commenced. If thou dost “delight in the way” of Christ, and art truly
a Christian (for he is a Christian indeed who does not despise the way of Christ, but “de-
lighteth in” following Christ’s “way” through His sufferings), do not thou go by any other
way than that by which He Himself hath also gone. It appears painful, but it is the very way
of safety; another perhaps is delightful, but it is full of robbers. “And he delighteth in His
way.”
896 Ps. cxlii. 5.
897 Rom. viii. 17.
Part 2
14. “Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholdeth his hand”
(ver. 24). See what it is “to delight in” Christ’s “way.” Should it happen that he suffers some
tribulation; some forfeiture of honour, some affliction, some loss, some contumely, or all
those other accidents incident to mankind frequently in this life, he sets the Lord before
him, what kind of trials He endured! and, “though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down,
for the Lord upholdeth his hand,” because He has suffered before him. For what shouldest
thou fear, O man, whose steps are ordered so, that thou shouldest “delight in the way of the
Lord”? What shouldest thou fear? Pain? Christ was scourged. Shouldest thou fear contume-
lies? He was reproached with, “Thou hast a devil,”898 who was Himself casting out the
devils. Haply thou fearest faction, and the conspiracy of the wicked. Conspiracy was made
against Him. Thou canst not make clear the purity of thy conscience in some accusation,
and sufferest wrong and violence, because false witnesses are listened to against thee. False
witness was borne against Him first, not only before His death, but also after His resurrec-
tion.…

On the Third Part of the Psalm.899
1. “I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor
his seed begging bread” (ver. 25).
If it is spoken but in the person of one single individual, how long is the whole life of
one man? And what is there wonderful in the circumstance, that a single man, fixed in some
one part of the earth, should not, throughout the whole space of his life, being so short as
man’s life is, have ever seen “the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread,” although
he may have advanced from youth to age. It is not anything worthy of marvel; for it might
have happened, that before his lifetime there should have been some “righteous man seeking
bread;” it might have happened, that there had been some one in some other part of the
earth not where he himself was. Hear too another thing, which makes an impression upon
us. Any single one among you (look you) who has now grown old, may perhaps, when,
looking back upon the past course of his life, he turns over in his thoughts the persons whom
he has known, not find any instance of a righteous man begging bread, or of his seed begging
bread, suggest itself to him; but nevertheless he turns to the inspired Scriptures, and finds
that righteous Abraham was straitened, and suffered hunger in his own country, and left
that land for another; he finds too that the son of the very same man, Isaac, removed to
other countries in search of bread, for the same cause of hunger. And how will it be true to
say, “I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread”? And if he finds
this true in the duration of his own life, he finds it is otherwise in the inspired writings,
which are more trustworthy than human life is.
2. What are we to do then? Let us be seconded by your pious attention, so that we may
discern the purpose of God in these verses of the Psalm, what it is He would have us under-
stand by them. For there is a fear, lest any unstable person, not capable of understanding
the Scriptures spiritually, should appeal to human instances, and should observe the virtuous
servants of God to be sometimes in some necessity, and in want, so as to be compelled to
beg bread: should particularly call to mind the Apostle Paul, who says, “In hunger and thirst;
in cold and nakedness;”900 and should stumble thereat, saying to himself, “Is that certainly
true901 which I have been singing? Is that certainly true, which I have been sounding forth
in so devout a voice, standing in church? ‘I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his
seed begging bread.’” Lest he should say in his heart, “Scripture deceives us;” and all his
limbs should be paralyzed to good works: and when those limbs within him, those limbs of
the inner man, shall have been paralyzed (which is the more fearful paralysis), he should
henceforth leave off from good works, and say to himself, “Wherefore do I do good works?
899 On another day.

Part 3
Wherefore do I break my bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked, and take home to mine
house him who hath no shelter,902 putting faith in that which is written? ‘I have never seen
the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread;’ whereas I see so many persons who live
virtuously, yet for the most part suffering from hunger. But if perhaps I am in error in
thinking the man who is living well, and the man who is living ill, to be both of them living
well, and if God knows him to be otherwise; that is, knows him, whom I think just, to be
unjust, what am I to make of Abraham’s case, who is commended by Scripture itself as a
righteous person? What am I to make of the Apostle Paul, who says, ‘Be ye followers of me,
even as I also am of Christ.’903 What? that I should myself be in evils such as he endured,
‘In hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness’?”904
3. Whilst therefore he thus thinks, and whilst his limbs are paralyzed to the power of
good works, can we, my brethren, as it were, lift up the sick of the palsy; and, as it were, “lay
open the roof” of this Scripture, and let him down before the Lord.905 For you observe that
it is obscure. If obscure therefore, it is covered. And I behold a certain patient paralytic in
mind, and I see this roof, and am convinced that Christ is concealed beneath the roof. Let
me, as far as I am able, do that which was praised in those who opened the roof, and let
down the sick of the palsy before Christ; that He might say unto him, “Son, be of good cheer,
thy sins be forgiven thee.” 906 For it was so that He made the inner man whole of his palsy,
by loosing his sins, by binding fast his faith.…
4. But who is “the righteous” man, who “hath never been seen forsaken, nor his seed
begging bread”? If you understand what is meant by “bread,” you understand who is meant
by him. For the “bread” is the Word of God, which never departs from the righteous man’s
mouth.…See now if “holy meditation doth ‘keep thee’” in the rumination of this bread, then
“hast thou never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.”
5. “He is always merciful, and lendeth” (ver. 26). “Fœneratur” is used in Latin indeed,
both for him who lendeth, and for him who borroweth. But in this passage the meaning is
more plain, if we express it by “fœnerat.” What matters it to us, what the grammarians please
to rule? It were better for us to be guilty of a barbarism, so that ye understand, than that in
our propriety of speech ye be left unprovided. Therefore, that “righteous man is all day
merciful, and (fœnerat) lendeth.” Let not the lenders of money on usury, however, rejoice.
For we find it is a particular kind of lender that is spoken of, as it was a particular kind of
bread; that we may, in all passages, “remove the roof,” and find our way to Christ. I would

Part 3
not have you be lenders of money on usury; and I would not have you be such for this
reason, because God would not have you.…Whence does it appear that God would not have
it so? It is said in another place, “He that putteth not out his money to usury.”907 And how
detestable, odious, and execrable a thing it is, I believe that even usurers themselves know.
Again, on the other hand, I myself, nay rather our God Himself bids thee be an usurer, and
says to thee, “Lend unto God.” If thou lendest to man, hast thou hope? and shalt thou not
have hope, if thou lendest to God? If thou hast lent thy money on usury to man, that is, if
thou hast given the loan of thy money to one, from whom thou dost expect to receive
something more than thou hast given, not in money only, but anything, whether it be wheat,
or wine, or oil, or whatever else you please, if you expect to receive more than you have
given, you are an usurer, and in this particular are not deserving of praise, but of censure.
“What then,” you say, “am I to do, that I may ‘lend’ profitably?” Consider what the usurer
does. He undoubtedly desires to give a less sum, and to receive a larger; do thou this also;
give thou a little, receive much. See how thy principal grows, and increases! Give “things
temporal,” receive “things eternal:” give earth, receive heaven! And perhaps thou wouldest
say, “To whom shall I give them?” The self-same Lord, who bade thee not lend on usury,
comes forward as the Person to whom thou shouldest lend on usury! Hear from Scripture
in what way thou mayest “lend unto the Lord.” “He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth unto
the Lord.”908 For the Lord wanteth not aught of thee. But thou hast one who needs somewhat
of thee: thou extendest it to him; he receives it. For the poor hath nothing to return to thee,
and yet he would himself fain requite thee, and finds nothing wherewith to do it: all that
remains in his power is the good-will that desires to pray for thee. Now when the poor man
prays for thee, he, as it were, says unto God, “Lord, I have borrowed this; be Thou surety
for me.” Then, though you have no bond on the poor man to compel his repayment, yet
you have on a sponsible security. See, God from His own Scriptures saith unto thee; “Give
it, and fear not; I repay it. It is to Me thou givest it.” In what way do those who make them-
selves sureties for others, express themselves? What is it that they say? “I repay it: I take it
upon myself. It is to me you are giving it.” Do we then suppose that God also says this, “I
take it on Myself. It is unto me thou givest it”? Assuredly, if Christ be God, of which there
is no doubt, He hath Himself said, “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me meat.”909 And when
they said unto Him, “When saw we Thee hungry?”910 that He might show Himself to be
the Surety for the poor, that He answers for all His members, that He is the Head, they the

members, and that when the members receive, the Head receiveth also; He says, “Inasmuch
as ye have done it to one of the least of these that belong to Me, ye have done it unto Me.”911
Come, thou covetous usurer, consider what thou hast given; consider what thou art to receive.
Hadst thou given a small sum of money, and he to whom thou hadst given it were to give
thee for that small sum a great villa, worth incomparably more money than thou hadst given,
how great thanks wouldest thou render, with how great joy wouldest thou be transported!
Hear what possession He to whom thou hast been lending bestows. “Come, ye blessed of
My Father, receive” 912—What? The same that they have given? God forbid! What you gave
were earthly things, which, if you had not given them, would have become corrupted on
earth. For what could you have made of them, if you had not given them? That which on
earth would have been lost, has been preserved in heaven. Therefore what we are to receive
is that which hath been preserved. It is thy desert that hath been preserved, thy desert hath
been made thy treasure. For consider what it is that thou art to receive. Receive—“the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” On the other hand, what shall
be their sentence, who would not “lend”? “Go ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
and his angels.”913 And what is the kingdom which we receive called? Consider what follows:
“And these shall go into everlasting burning; but the righteous into life eternal.”914 Make
interest for this; purchase this. Give your money on usury to earn this. You have Christ
throned in heaven, begging on earth. We have discovered in what way the righteous lendeth.
“He is alway merciful, and lendeth.”
6. “And his seed is blessed.” Here too let not any carnal notion suggest itself. We see
many of the sons of the righteous dying of hunger; in what sense then will his seed be blessed?
His seed is that which remains of him afterwards; that wherewith he soweth here, and will
hereafter reap. For the Apostle says, “Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due season
we shall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore time,” he says, “let us do good unto all
men.”915 This is that “seed” of thine which shall “be blessed.” You commit it to the earth,
and gather ever so much more; and dost thou lose it in committing it to Christ? See it ex-
pressly termed “seed” by the Apostle, when he was speaking of alms. For this he saith; “He
which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth in blessings,916 shall
also reap in blessings.”917…

7. Observe therefore what follows, and be not slothful. “Depart from evil, and do good”
(ver. 27). Do not think it to be enough for thee to do, if thou dost not strip the man who is
already clothed. For in not stripping the man who is already clothed, thou hast indeed “de-
parted from evil:” but do not be barren, and wither. So choose not to strip the man who is
clothed already, as to clothe the naked. For this is to “depart from evil, and to do good.”
And you will say, “What advantage am I to derive from it?” He to whom thou lendest has
already assured thee of what He will give thee. He will give thee everlasting life. Give to Him,
and fear not! Hear too what follows: “Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore.”
And think not when thou givest that no one sees thee, or that God forsakes thee, when haply
after thou hast given to the poor, and some loss, or some sorrow for the property thou hast
lost, should follow, and thou shouldest say to thyself, “What hath it profited me to have
done good works? I believe God doth not love the men who do good.” Whence comes that
buzz, that subdued murmur among you, except that those expressions are very common?
Each one of you at this present moment recognises these expressions, either in his own lips,
or on those of his friend. May God destroy them; may He root out the thorns from His field;
may He plant “the good seed,” and “the tree bearing fruit”! For wherefore art thou afflicted,
O man, that thou hast given some things away to the poor, and hast lost certain other things?
Seest thou not that it is what thou hast not given, that thou hast lost? Wherefore dost thou
not attend to the voice of thy God? Where is thy faith? wherefore is it so fast asleep? Wake
it up in thy heart. Consider what the Lord Himself said unto thee, while exhorting thee to
good works of this kind: “Provide yourselves bags which wax not old; a treasure in the
heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth.”918 Call this to mind therefore when
you are lamenting over a loss. Wherefore dost thou lament, thou fool of little mind, or rather
of unsound mind? Wherefore didst thou lose it, except that thou didst not lend it to Me?
Wherefore didst thou lose it? Who has carried it off? Thou wilt answer, “A thief.” Was it
not this, that I forewarned thee of? that thou shouldest not lay it up where the thief could
approach? If then he who has lost anything, grieves, let him grieve for this, that he did not
lay it up there, whence it could not be lost.
8. “For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not His Saints” (ver. 28). When the
Saints suffer affliction, think not that God doth not judge, or doth not judge righteously.
Will He, who warns thee to judge righteously, Himself judge unrighteously? He “loveth
judgment, and forsaketh not His Saints.” But (think) how919 the “life” of the Saints is “hid
with Him,” in such a manner, that who now suffer trouble on earth, like trees in the winter-
time, having no fruit and leaves, when He, like a newly-risen sun, shall have appeared, that

that.”

which before was living in their root, will show itself forth in fruits. He does then “love
judgment, and doth not forsake His Saints.”…
9. “But the unrighteous shall be punished; the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.” Just
as the “seed of the” other “shall be blessed,” so shall the “seed of the wicked be cut off.” For
the “seed” of the wicked is the works of the wicked. For again, on the other hand, we find
the son of the wicked man flourish in the world, and sometimes become righteous, and
flourish in Christ. Be careful therefore how thou takest it; that thou mayest remove the
covering, and make thy way to Christ.920 Do not take the text in a carnal sense; for thou
wilt be deceived. But “the seed of the wicked”—all the works of the wicked—“will be cut
off:” they shall have no fruit. For they are effective indeed for a short time; afterwards they
shall seek for them, and shall not find the reward of that which they have wrought. For it is
the expression of those who lose what they have wrought, that text which says, “What hath
pride profited us, or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us? All those things
are passed away like a shadow.”921 “The seed of the wicked,” then, “shall be cut off.”
10. “The righteous shall inherit the land” (ver. 29). Here again let not covetousness steal
on thee, nor promise thee some great estate; hope not to find there, what you are commanded
to despise in this world. That “land” in the text, is a certain “land of the living,” the kingdom
of the Saints. Whence it is said: “Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.”
922 For if thy life too is the same life as that there spoken of, think what sort of “land” thou
art about to inherit. That is “the land of the living;” this the land of those who are about to
die: to receive again, when dead, those whom it nourished when living. Such then as is that
land, such shall the life itself be also: if the life be for ever, “the land” also is to be thine “for
ever.” And how is “the land” to be thine “for ever”?
“And they shall dwell therein” (it says) “for ever.” It must therefore be another land,
where “they are to dwell therein for ever.” For of this land (of this earth) it is said, “Heaven
and earth shall pass away.”923
11. “The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom” (ver. 30). See here is that “bread.”
Observe with what satisfaction this righteous man feedeth upon it; how he turns wisdom
over and over in his mouth. “And his tongue talketh of judgment.”
“The law of his God is in his heart” (ver. 31). Lest haply thou shouldest think him to
have that on his lips, which he hath not in his heart, lest thou shouldest reckon him among
those of whom it is said, “This people honour Me with their lips, but their heart is far from
Me.”924 And of what use is this to him?

“And none of his steps shall slide.” The “word of God in the heart” frees from the snare;
the “word of God in the heart” delivers from the evil way; “the word of God in the heart”
delivers from “the slippery place.”925 He is with thee, Whose word departeth not from thee.
Now what evil doth he suffer, whom God keepeth? Thou settest a watchman in thy vineyard,
and feelest secure from thieves; and that watchman may sleep, and may himself fall, and
may admit a thief. But “He who keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.”926 “The law
of his God is in his heart, and none of his steps shall slide.” Let him therefore live free from
fear; let him live free from fear even in the midst of the wicked; free from fear even in the
midst of the ungodly. For what evil can the ungodly or unrighteous man do to the righteous?
Lo! see what follows.
“The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him” (ver. 32). For he says,
what it was foretold in the book of Wisdom that he should say, “He is grievous unto us,
even to behold; for his life is not like other men’s.”927 Therefore he “seeks to slay him.”
What? Doth the Lord, who keepeth him, who dwelleth with him, who departeth not from
his lips, from his heart, doth He forsake him? What then becomes of what was said before:
“And He forsaketh not His Saints”?928
12. “The wicked therefore watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. But the Lord
will not leave him in his hands” (ver. 33). Wherefore then did He leave the Martyrs in the
hands of the ungodly? Wherefore did they do unto them “whatsoever they would”?929 Some
they slew with the sword; some they crucified; some they delivered to the beasts; some they
burnt by fire; others they led about in chains, till wasted out by a long protracted decay.
Assuredly “the Lord forsaketh not His Saints.” He will not “leave him in his hands.” Lastly,
wherefore did He leave His own Son in “the hands of the ungodly”? Here also, if thou
wouldest have all the limbs of thy inner man made strong, remove the covering of the roof,
and find thy way to the Lord. Hear what another Scripture, foreseeing our Lord’s future
suffering at the hands of the ungodly, saith. What saith it? “The earth is given into the hands
of the wicked.”930 What is meant by “earth” being “given into the hands of the ungodly”?
The delivering of the flesh into the hands of the persecutors. But God did not leave “His
righteous One”931 there: from the flesh, which was taken captive, He leads forth the soul
unconquered.…

“The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when there shall be judgment
for him” (ver. 33). Some copies have it, “and when He shall judge him, there shall be judg
ment for him.” “For him,” however, means when sentence is passed upon him. For we can
express ourselves so as to say to a person, “Judge for me,” i.e. “hear my cause.” When
therefore God shall begin to hear the cause of His righteous servant, since “we must all” be
presented “before the tribunal of Christ,” and stand before it to receive every one “the things
he hath done in this body,”932 whether good or evil, when therefore he shall have come to
that Judgment, He will not condemn him; though he may seem to be condemned in this
present life by man. Even though the Proconsul may have passed sentence on Cyprian,933
yet the earthly seat of judgment is one thing, the heavenly tribunal is another. From the in-
ferior tribunal he receives sentence of death; from the superior one a crown, “Nor will He
condemn him when there shall be judgment for him.”
13. “Wait on the Lord” (ver. 34). And while I am waiting upon Him, what am I to
do?—“and keep His ways.” And if I keep them, what am I to receive? “And He shall exalt
thee to inherit the land.” “What land”? Once more let not any estate suggest itself to your
mind:—the land of which it is said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” 934 What of those who have troubled
us, in the midst of whom we have groaned, whose scandals we have patiently endured, for
whom, while they were raging against us, we have prayed in vain? What will become of
them? What follows? “When the wicked are cut off, thou shall see it.”…
“I have seen the ungodly lifted up on high, and rising above the cedars of Libanus” (ver.
35). And suppose him to be “lifted up on high;” suppose him to be towering above the “rest;”
what follows?
“I passed by, and, lo, he was not! I sought him, and his place could nowhere be found!”
(ver. 36). Why was he “no more, and his place nowhere to be found”? Because thou hast
“passed by.” But if thou art yet carnally-minded, and that earthly prosperity appears to thee
to be true happiness, thou hast not yet “passed by” him; thou art either his fellow, or thou
art below him; go on, and pass him; and when thou hast made progress, and hast passed by
him, thou observest him by the eye of faith; thou seest his end, thou sayest to thyself, “Lo!
he who so swelled before, is not!” just as if it were some smoke that thou wert passing near
to. For this too was said above in this very Psalm, “They shall consume and fade away as
the smoke.”935…

14. “Keep innocency” (ver. 37); keep it even as thou usedst to keep thy purse, when thou
wert covetous; even as thou usedst to hold fast that purse, that it might not be snatched from
thy grasp by the thief, even so “keep innocency,” lest that be snatched from thy grasp by the
devil. Be that thy sure inheritance, of which the rich and the poor may both be sure. “Keep
innocency.” What doth it profit thee to gain gold, and to lose innocence?
“Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing which is right.” Keep thou thine eyes
“right,” that thou mayest see “the thing which is right;” not perverted, wherewith thou
lookest upon the wicked; not distorted, so that God should appear to thee distorted and
wrong, in that He favours the wicked, and afflicts the faithful with persecutions. Dost thou
not observe how distorted thy vision is? Set right thine eyes, and “behold the thing that is
right.” What “thing that is right”? Take no heed of things present. And what wilt thou see?
“For there is a remainder for the man that maketh peace.”936 What is meant by “there
is a remainder”? When thou art dead, thou shalt not be dead. This is the meaning of “there
is a remainder.” He will still have something remaining to him, even after this life, that is
to say, that “seed,” which “shall be blessed.” Whence our Lord saith, “He that believeth on
Me, though he die, yet shall he live;”937—“seeing there is a remainder for the man that
maketh peace.”
15. “But the transgressors shall be destroyed in the self-same thing”938 (ver. 38). What
is meant by, “in the self-same thing”? It means for ever: or all together in one and the same
destruction.
“The remainder of the wicked shall be cut off.” Now there is “(a remainder) for the man
that maketh peace:” they therefore who are not peace-makers939 are ungodly. For, “Blessed
are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the children of God.”940
16. “But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord, and He is their strength in the time
of trouble” (ver. 39). “And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them; He shall deliver them
from the sinners”941 (ver. 40). At present therefore let the righteous bear with the sinner;
let the wheat bear with the tares; let the grain bear with the chaff: for the time of separation
will come, and the good seed shall be set apart from that which is to be consumed with
fire.942 The one will be consigned to the garner, the other to “everlasting burning;” for it

Psalm XXXVIII.944
A psalm to David himself, on the remembrance of the Sabbath.
1. What doth this recollection of the Sabbath mean? What is this Sabbath? For it is with
groaning that he “calls it to recollection.” You have both heard already when the Psalm was
read, and you will now hear it when we shall go over it, how great is his groaning, his
mourning, his tears, his misery. But happy he who is wretched after this manner! Whence
the Lord also in the Gospel945 called some who mourn blessed. “How should he be blessed
if he is a mourner? How blessed, if he is miserable?” Nay rather, he would be miserable, if
he were not a mourner. Such an one then let us understand here too, calling the Sabbath to
remembrance (viz.), some mourner or other: and would that we were ourselves that “some
one or other”! For there is here some person sorrowing, groaning, mourning, calling the
Sabbath to remembrance. The Sabbath is rest. Doubtless he was in some disquietude, who
with groaning was calling the Sabbath to remembrance.…
2. “O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine indignation; neither chasten me in Thy hot displeas-
ure” (ver. 1). For it will be that some shall be chastened in God’s “hot displeasure,” and re-
buked in His “indignation.” And haply not all who are “rebuked” will be “chastened;” yet
are there some that are to be saved in the chastening.946 So it is to be indeed, because it is
called “chastening,”947 but yet it shall be “so as by fire.” But there are to be some who will
be “rebuked,” and will not be “corrected.” For he will at all events “rebuke”948 those to whom
He will say, “I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat.”949… “Neither chasten me in Thy
hot displeasure;” so that Thou mayest cleanse me in this life, and make me such, that I may
after that stand in no need of the cleansing fire, for those “who are to be saved, yet so as by
fire.”950 Why? Why, but because they “build upon the foundation, wood, stubble, and hay.”
Now they should build on it, “gold, silver, and precious stones;”951 and should have nothing
to fear from either fire: not only that which is to consume the ungodly for ever, but also that
which is to purge those who are to escape through952 the fire. For it is said, “he himself shall
be saved, yet so as by fire.” And because it is said, “he shall be saved,” that fire is thought

lightly of. For all that, though we should be “saved by fire,” yet will that fire be more grievous
than anything that man can suffer in this life whatsoever.953…
3. Now on what ground does this person pray that he may not be “rebuked in indignation,
nor chastened in hot displeasure”? (He speaks) as if he would say unto God, “Since the
things which I already suffer are many in number, I pray Thee let them suffice;” and he begins
to enumerate them, by way of satisfying God; offering what he suffers now, that he may not
have to suffer worse evils hereafter.
4. “For Thine arrows stick fast in me, and Thy hand presseth me sore” (ver. 2). “There
is no soundness in my flesh, from the face of Thine anger” (ver. 3). He has now begun telling
these evils, which he is suffering here: and yet even this already was from the wrath of the
Lord, because it was of the vengeance of the Lord. “Of what vengeance?” That which He
took upon Adam. For think not that punishment was not inflicted upon him, or that God
had said to no purpose, “Thou shalt surely die;”954 or that we suffer anything in this life,
except from that death which we earned by the original sin.…Whence then do His “arrows
stick fast in” him? The very punishment, the very vengeance, and haply the pains both of
mind and of body, which it is necessary for us to suffer here, these he describes by these
self-same “arrows.” For of these arrows holy Job also made mention,955 and said that the
arrows of the Lord stuck fast in him, whilst he was labouring under those pains. We are
used, however, to call God’s words also arrows; but could he grieve that he should be struck
by these? The words of God are arrows, as it were, that inflame love, not pain.…We may
then understand the “arrows sticking fast,” thus: Thy words are fixed fast in my heart; and
by those words themselves is it come to pass, that I “called the Sabbath to remembrance:”
and that very remembrance of the Sabbath, and the non-possession of it at present, prevents
me from rejoicing at present; and causes me to acknowledge that there “is neither health in
my very flesh,” neither ought it to be so called when I compare this sort of soundness to that
soundness which I am to possess in the everlasting rest; where “this corruptible shall put
on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality,” 956 and see that in comparison
with that soundness this present kind is but sickness.
953 [See Augustin’s ideas as to a possible meaning of the text 1 Cor. iii. 11–15 in vol. ii. this series, p. 474. He
there propounds, as a conjecture merely, a purification of some souls in the intermediate state, which he does
not care to reject. It is not his own theory; he says, I do not contradict; possibly it is true.” He thus proves there
was no dogma of any sort of purgatory in his day, and even this theory is entirely inconsistent with the dogma
as expounded in the Trent Catechism.—C.]

Psalm XXXVIII
5. “Neither is there any rest in my bones, from the face of my sin.” It is commonly en-
quired, of what person this is the speech; and some understand it to be Christ’s, on account
of some things which are here said of the Passion of Christ; to which we shall shortly come;
and which we ourselves shall acknowledge to be spoken of His Passion. But how could He
who had no sin, say, “There is no rest in my bones, from the face of my sin.”…For if we
were to say that they are not the words of Christ, those words, “My God, My God, why hast
Thou forsaken Me?”957 will also not be the words of Christ. For there too you have, “My
God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” “The words of mine offences are far from my
health.” Just as here you have, “from the face of my sins,” so there also you have, “the words
of my offences.” And if Christ is, for all that, without “sin,” and without “offences,” we begin
to think those words in the Psalm also not to be His. And it is exceedingly harsh and incon-
sistent that that Psalm should not relate to Christ, where we have His Passion as clearly laid
open as if it were being read to us out of the Gospel. For there we have, “They parted My
garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.”958 Why should I mention that the
first verse of that Psalm was pronounced by the Lord Himself while hanging on the Cross,
with His own mouth, saying, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” What did
He mean to be inferred from it, but that the whole of that Psalm relates to Him, seeing He
Himself, the Head of His Body, pronounced it in His own Person? Now when it goes on to
say, “the words of mine offences,” it is beyond a doubt that they are the words of Christ.
Whence then come “the sins,” but from the Body, which is the Church? Because both the
Head and the Body of Christ are speaking. Why do they speak as if one person only? Because
“they twain,” as He hath said, “shall be one flesh.”959 “This” (says the Apostle) “is a great
mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.”…For why should He not say, “my
sins,” who said, “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me
no drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in. I was sick and in prison, and ye visited
Me not.”960 Assuredly the Lord was not in prison. Why should He not say this, to whom
when it was said, “When saw we Thee a hungred, and athirst, or in prison; and did not
minister unto Thee?” He replied, that He spake thus in the person of His Body. “Inasmuch
as ye did it not unto one of the least of Mine, ye did it not unto Me.”961 Why should He not
say, “from the face of my sins,” who said to Saul, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me,”962
who, however, being in Heaven, now suffered from no persecutors? But just as, in that pas-

sage, the Head spake for the Body, so here too the Head speaks the words of the Body; whilst
you hear at the same time the accents of the Head Itself also. Yet do not either, when you
hear the voice of the Body, separate the Head from it; nor the Body, when you hear the voice
of the Head: because “they are no more twain, but one flesh.”963
6. “There is no soundness in my flesh from the face of thine anger.” But perhaps God
is unjustly angry with thee, O Adam; unjustly angry with thee, O son of man; because now
brought to acknowledge that thy punishment, now that thou art a man that hath been placed
in Christ’s Body, thou hast said, “There is no soundness in my flesh from the face of Thine
anger.” Declare the justice of God’s anger: lest thou shouldest seem to be excusing thyself,
and accusing Him. Go on to tell whence the “anger” of the Lord proceeds. “There is no
soundness in my flesh from the face of Thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones.”
He repeats what he said before, “There is no soundness in my flesh;” for, “There is no rest
in my bones,” is equivalent to this. He does not however repeat “from the face of Thine an-
ger;” but states the cause of the anger of God. “There is no rest in my bones from the face
of my sins.”
7. “For mine iniquities have lifted up my head; and are like a heavy burden too heavy
for me to bear” (ver. 4). Here too he has placed the cause first, and the effect afterwards.
What consequence followed, and from what cause, he has told us. “Mine iniquities have lift
up mine head.” For no one is proud but the unrighteous man, whose head is lifted up. He
is “lifted up,” whose “head is lifted up on high” against God. You heard when the lesson of
the Book of Ecclesiasticus was read: “The beginning of pride is when a man departeth from
God.”964 He who was the first to refuse to listen to the Commandment, “his head iniquity
lifted up” against God. And because his iniquities have lifted up his head, what hath God
done unto him? They are “like a heavy burden, too heavy for me to bear”! It is the part of
levity to lift up the head, just as if he who lifts up his head had nothing to carry. Since
therefore that which admits of being lifted up is light, it receives a weight by which it may
be weighed down. For “his mischief returns upon his own head, and his violent dealing
comes down upon his own pate.”965 “They are like a heavy burden, too heavy for me to
bear.”
8. “My wounds stink and are corrupt” (ver. 5). Now he who has wounds is not perfectly
sound. Add to this, that the wounds “stink and are corrupt.” Wherefore do they “stink”?
Because they are “corrupt:” now in what way this is explained in reference to human life,
who doth not understand? Let a man but have his soul’s sense of smelling sound, he perceives
how foully sins stink. The contrary to which stink of sin, is that savour of which the Apostle
963 Matt. xix. 6.
964 Ecclus. x. 12. [Note “as a Lesson:” part of Divine Service.—C.]
965 Ps. vii. 16.
Psalm XXXVIII
says, “We are the sweet savour of Christ unto God, in every place, unto them which be
saved.”966 But whence is this, except from hope? Whence is this, but from our “calling the
Sabbath to remembrance”? For it is a different thing that we mourn over in this life, from
that which we anticipate in the other. That which we mourn over is stench, that which we
reckon upon is fragrance. Were there not therefore such a perfume as that to invite us, we
should never call the Sabbath to remembrance.967 But since, by the Spirit, we have such a
perfume, as to say to our Betrothed, “Because of the savour of Thy good ointments we will
run after Thee;”968 we turn our senses away from our own unsavourinesses, and turning
ourselves to Him, we gain some little breathing-time. But indeed, unless our evil deeds also
did smell rank in our nostrils, we should never confess with those groans, “My wounds stink
and are corrupt.” And wherefore? “from the face of my foolishness.”969 From the same
cause that he said before, “from the face of my sins;” from that same cause he now says,
“from the face of my foolishness.”
9. “I am troubled, I am bowed down even unto the end” (ver. 6). Wherefore was he
“bowed down”? Because he had been “lifted up.” If thou art “humble, thou shalt be exalted;”
if thou exaltest thyself, thou shalt be “bowed down;” for God will be at no loss to find a
weight wherewith to bow thee down.…Let him groan on these things; that he may receive
the other; let him “call the Sabbath to remembrance,” that he may deserve to arrive at it.
For that which the Jews used to celebrate was but a sign. Of what thing was it the sign? Of
that which he calls to remembrance, who saith, “I am troubled, and am bowed down even
unto the end.” What is meant by even “unto the end”? Even to death.
“I go mourning all the day long.” “All day long,” that is, “without intermission.” By “all
the day long,” he means, “all my life long.” But from what time hath he known it? From the
time that he began to “call the Sabbath to remembrance.” For so long as he “calls to remem-
brance” what he no longer possesses, wouldest thou not have him “go mourning”? “All the
day long have I gone mourning.”
10. “For my soul is filled with illusions, and there is no soundness in my flesh” (ver. 7).
Where there is the whole man, there there is soul and flesh both. The “soul is filled with il-
lusions;” the flesh hath “no soundness.” What does there remain that can give joy? Is it not
meet that one should “go mourning”? “All the day long have I gone mourning.” Let
mourning be our portion, until our soul be divested of its illusions; and our body be clothed
with soundness. For true soundness is no other than immortality. How great however are
the soul’s illusions, were I even to attempt to express, when would the time suffice me? For
966 2 Cor. ii. 15.
967 [Isa. lviii. 13.—C.]
968 Song of Sol. i. 3, 4.
969 Ps. xxxviii. 5.
Psalm XXXVIII
whose soul is not subject to them? There is a brief particular that I will remind you of, to
show how our soul is filled with illusions. The presence of those illusions sometimes scarcely
permits us to pray. We know not how to think of material objects without images, and such
as we do not wish, rush in upon the mind; and we wish to go from this one to that, and to
quit that for another. And sometimes you wish to return to that which you were thinking
of before, and to quit that which you are now thinking of; and a fresh one presents itself to
you; you wish to call up again what you had forgotten; and it does not occur to you; and
another comes instead which you would not have wished for. Where meanwhile was the
one that you had forgotten? For why did it afterwards occur to you, when it had ceased to
be sought after; whereas, while it was being sought for, innumerable others, which were not
desired, presented themselves instead of it? I have stated a fact briefly; I have thrown out a
kind of hint or suggestion to you, brethren, taking up which, you may yourselves suggest
the rest to yourselves, and discover what it is to mourn over the “illusions” of our “soul.”
He hath received therefore the punishment of illusion; he hath forfeited Truth. For just as
illusion is the soul’s punishment, so is Truth its reward. But when we were set in the midst
of these illusions, the Truth Itself came to us, and found us overwhelmed by illusions, took
upon Itself our flesh, or rather took flesh from us; that is, from the human race. He manifested
himself to the eyes of the Flesh, that He might “by faith” heal those to whom He was going
to reveal the Truth hereafter, that Truth might be manifested to the now healed eye. For He
is Himself “the Truth,”970 which He promised unto us at that time, when His Flesh was to
be seen by the eye, that the foundation might be laid of that Faith, of which the Truth was
to be the reward. For it was not Himself that Christ showed forth on earth; but it was His
Flesh that He showed. For had He showed Himself, the Jews would have seen and known
Him; but had they “known Him, they would never have crucified the Lord of Glory.”971
But perhaps His disciples saw Him, when they said unto Him, “Show us the Father, and it
sufficeth us;”972 and He, to show that it was not Himself that had been seen by them, added:
“Have I been so long with you, and have ye not known Me, Philip? He that seeth Me, seeth
the Father also.”973 If then they saw Christ, wherefore did they yet seek for the Father? For
if it were Christ whom they saw, they would have seen the Father also. They did not therefore
yet see Christ, who desired that the Father should be shown unto them. To prove that they
did not yet see Him, hear that, in another place, He promised it by way of reward, saying,
“He who loveth Me, keepeth My commandments; and whoso loveth Me, shall be loved of
My Father; and I will love Him and” (as if it were said to Him, “what wilt Thou give unto
970 John xiv. 6.
971 1 Cor. ii. 10.
972 John xiv. 8.
973 John xiv. 9.
Psalm XXXVIII
him, as Thou lovest him?” He saith), “I will manifest Myself unto him.”974 If then He
promises this by way of a reward unto them that love Him, it is manifest that the vision of
the Truth, promised to us, is of such a nature, that, when we have seen it, we shall no longer
say, “My soul is filled with illusions.”
11. “I am become feeble,975 and am bowed down greatly” (ver. 8). He who calls to mind
the transcendent height of the Sabbath, sees how “greatly” he is himself “bowed down.” For
he who cannot conceive what is that height of rest, sees not where he is at present. Therefore
another Psalm hath said, “I said in my trance, I am cast out of the sight of Thine eyes.”976
For his mind being taken up thither,977 he beheld something sublime; and was not yet entirely
there, where what he beheld was; and a kind of flash, as it were, if one may so speak, of the
Eternal Light having glanced upon him, when he perceived that he was not yet arrived at
this, which he was able after a sort to understand, he saw where he himself was, and how
he was cramped and “bowed down” by human infirmities. And he says, “I said in my trance,
I am cast out of the sight of Thine eyes.” Such is that certain something which I saw in my
trance, that thence I perceive how far off I am, who am not already there. He was already
there who said that he was “caught up into the third Heaven, and there heard unspeakable
words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.”978 But he was recalled to us, in order that,
as requiring to be made perfect, he might first mourn his infirmity, and afterwards be clothed
with might. Yet encouraged for the ministration of his office by having seen somewhat of
those things, he goes on saying, “I heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man
to utter.”979 Now then what use is it for you to ask, either of me or of any one, the “things
which it is not lawful for man to utter.” If it was not lawful for him to utter them, to whom
is it lawful to hear them? Let us however lament and groan in Confession; let us own where
we are; let us “call the Sabbath to remembrance,” and wait with patience for what He has
promised, who hath, in His own Person also, showed forth an example of patience to us. “I
am become feeble, and bowed down greatly.”
12. “I have roared with the groaning of my heart.”980 You observe the servants of God
generally interceding with groaning; and the reason of it is asked, and there is nothing ap-
parent, but the groaning of some servant of God, if indeed it does find its way at all to the
ears of a person placed near him. For there is a secret groaning, which is not heard by man:
974 John xiv. 21.
975 St. Augustin, infirmatus; E.V. “troubled;” Prayer Book, “feeble;” Vulgate, afflictus.
976 Ps. xxxi. 22.

978 2 Cor. xii. 2, 4.
979 2 Cor. xii. 4.
980 Rugiebam a gemitu cordis mei. E.V. “by reason of the disquietness.”
Psalm XXXVIII
yet if the thought of some strong desire has taken so strong hold of the heart, that the wound
of the inner man finds expression in some uttered exclamation, the reason of it is asked;
and a man says to himself, “Perhaps this is the cause of his groaning;” and, “Perhaps this or
that hath befallen him.” Who can determine, but He in whose Eyes and Ears he groaned?
Therefore he says, “I roared with the groaning of mine heart;” because if men ever hear a
man’s groanings, they for the most part hear but the groaning of the flesh; they do not hear
him who groans “with the groaning of his heart.” Some one hath carried off his goods; he
“roareth,” but not “with the groaning of his heart:” another because he has buried his son,
another his wife; another because his vineyard has been injured by a hailstorm; another
because his cask has turned sour; another because some one hath stolen his beast; another
because he has suffered some loss; another because he fears some man who is his enemy:
all these “roar” with the “groaning of the flesh.” The servant of God, however, because he
“roareth” from the recollection of the Sabbath, where the Kingdom of God is, which flesh
and blood shall not possess, says, “I have roared with the groaning of my heart.”
13. And who observed and noticed the cause of his groaning? “All my desire is before
Thee” (ver. 9). For it is not before men who cannot see the heart, but it is before Thee that
all my desire is open! Let your desire be before Him; and “the Father, who seeth in secret,
shall reward thee.”981 For it is thy heart’s desire that is thy prayer; and if thy desire continues
uninterrupted, thy prayer continueth also. For not without a meaning did the Apostle say,
“Pray without ceasing.”982 Are we to be “without ceasing” bending the knee, prostrating
the body, or lifting up our hands, that he says, “Pray without ceasing”? Or if it is in this sense
that we say that we “pray,” this, I believe, we cannot do “without ceasing.” There is another
inward kind of prayer without ceasing, which is the desire of the heart. Whatever else you
are doing, if you do but long for that Sabbath, you do not cease to pray. If you would never
cease to pray, never cease to long after it. The continuance of thy longing is the continuance
of thy prayer. You will be ceasing to speak, if you cease to long for it. Who are those who
have ceased to speak? They of whom it is said, “Because iniquity shall abound, the love of
many shall wax cold.”983 The freezing of charity is the silence of the heart; the burning of
charity is the cry of the heart. If love continues still you are still lifting up your voice; if you
are always lifting up your voice, you are always longing after something; if always longing
for something absent, you are calling “the Sabbath rest to remembrance.” And it is important
you should understand too before whom the “roaring of thine heart” is open. Now then
consider what sort of desires those should be, that are before the eyes of God. Should it be
the desire for the death of our enemy? a thing which men flatter themselves they lawfully
981 Matt. vi. 6.
982 1 Thess. v. 17.
983 Matt. xxiv. 12.
Psalm XXXVIII
wish for? For sometimes we pray for what we ought not. Let us consider what they flatter
themselves they pray for lawfully! For they pray that some person may die, and his inheritance
come to them. But let those too, who pray for the death of their enemies, hear the Lord
saying, “Pray for your enemies.” 984 Let them not pray for this, that their enemies may die;
but rather pray for this, that they may be reclaimed; then will their enemies be dead; for
from the time that they are reclaimed, henceforth they will be enemies no longer. “And all
my desire is before Thee.” What if we suppose that our desire is before Him, and that yet
that very “groaning” is not before Him? How can that be, since our desire itself finds its
expression in “groaning”? Therefore follows, “And my groaning is not hid from Thee.”
From Thee indeed it is not hid; but from many men it is hid. The servant of God
sometimes seems to be saying in humility, “And my groaning is not hid from Thee.”
Sometimes also he seems to smile. Is then that longing dead in his heart? If however there
is the desire within, there is the “groaning” also. It does not always find its way to the ears
of man; but it never ceases to sound in the ears of God.
14. “My heart is troubled” (ver. 10). Wherefore is it troubled? “And my courage hath
failed me.” Generally something comes upon us on a sudden; the “heart is troubled;” the
earth quakes; thunder is sent from Heaven; a formidable attack is made upon us, or a horrible
sound heard. Perhaps a lion is seen on the road; the “heart is troubled.” Perhaps robbers lie
in wait for us; the “heart is troubled:” we are filled with a panic fear; from every quarter
something excites anxiety. Wherefore? Because “my courage hath failed me.” For what
would be feared, did that courage still remain unmoved? Whatever bad tidings were brought,
whatever threatened us, whatever sound was heard, whatever were to fall, whatever appeared
horrible, would inspire no terror. But whence that trouble? “My courage faileth me.”
Wherefore hath my courage failed me? “The light of mine eyes also is gone from me.” Thus
Adam also could not see “the light of his eyes.” For the “light of his eyes” was God Himself,
whom when he had offended, he fled to the shade, and hid himself among the trees of
Paradise.985 He shrunk in alarm from the face of God: and sought the shelter of the trees;
thenceforth among the trees he had no more “the light of his eyes,” at which he had been
wont to rejoice.…
15. “My lovers;” why should I henceforth speak of my enemies? “My lovers and my
neighbours drew nigh, and stood over against me” (ver. 11). Understand this that he saith,
“Stood over against me.” For if they stood over against me, they fell against themselves. “My
lovers and my neighbours drew nigh and stood over against me.”986 Let us now recognise
the words of the Head speaking; now let our Head in His Passion begin to dawn upon us.
984 Matt. v. 44.
985 Gen. iii. 8.
986 E.V. “and my friends stand aloof.”
Psalm XXXVIII
Yet again when the Head begins to speak, do not sever the Body from it. If the Head would
not separate itself from the words of the Body, should the Body dare to separate itself from
the sufferings of the Head? Do thou suffer in Christ’s suffering: for Christ, as it were, sinned
in thy infirmity. For just now He spoke of thy sins, as if speaking in His own Person, and
called them His own.…To those who wished to be near His exaltation, yet thought not of
His humility, He answered and said to them, “Can ye drink of the cup that I shall drink
of?”987 Those sufferings of the Lord then are our sufferings also: and were each individual
to serve God well, to keep faith truly, to render to each their dues, and to conduct himself
honestly among men, I should like to see if he does not suffer even that which Christ here
details in the account of His Passion. “My lovers and my neighbours drew nigh, and stood
over against me.”
16. “And my neighbours stood afar off.” Who were the “neighbours” that drew nigh,
and who were those who stood afar off? The Jews were “neighbours” because “near kinsmen,”
they drew near even when they crucified Him: the Apostles also were His “neighbours;” and
they also “stood afar off,” that they might not have to suffer with Him. This may also be
understood thus: “My friends,” that is, those who feigned themselves “My friends:” for they
feigned themselves His friends, when they said, “We know that Thou teachest the way of
God in truth;”988 when they wished to try Him, whether tribute ought to be paid to Cæsar;
when He convinced them out of their own mouth, they wished to seem to be His friends.
“But He needed not that any should testify of man, for He Himself knew what was in man;”989
so that when they spoke unto Him words of friendship, He answered them, “Why tempt ye
Me, ye hypocrites?”990 “My friends and my neighbours” then “drew near and stood over
against me, and my neighbours stood afar off.” You understand what I said. I called those
neighbours who “drew nigh,” and at the same time “stood afar off.” For they “drew nigh”
in the body, but “stood afar off” in their heart. Who were in the body so near to Him as
those who lifted Him on the Cross? Who in heart so as those who blasphemed Him? Hear
this sort of distance described by the Prophet Isaiah; observe this nearness and distance at
one and the same time. “This people honours Me with their lips:” behold, with their body
they draw near; “but their heart is far from Me.”991 The same persons are at the same time
“near” and “afar off” also: with their lips they are near, in heart afar off. However, because
the Apostles also stood afar off, through fear, we understand it more simply and properly
of them; so that we mean by it, that some drew near, and others stood afar off; since even
987 Matt. xx. 22.
988 Matt. xxii. 16.
989 John ii. 25.
990 Matt. xxii. 18.
991 Isa. xxix. 13.
Psalm XXXVIII
Peter, who had followed more boldly than the rest, was still so far off, that being questioned
and alarmed, he thrice denied the Lord, with whom he had promised to “be ready to die.”
Who afterwards that, from being afar off, he might be made to draw nigh, heard after the
resurrection the question, “Lovest thou Me?” and said, “I love Thee;”992 and by so saying
was brought “nigh,” even as by denying Him, he had become “far off;” till with the threefold
confession of love, he had put away from him his threefold denial. “And my neighbours
stood afar off.”
17. “They also that sought after my soul were preparing violence against me” (ver. 12).
It is now plain who “sought after His soul;” viz. those who had not His soul, in that they
were not in His Body. They who were “seeking after His soul,” were far removed from His
soul; but they were “seeking it” to destroy it. For His soul may be “sought after” in a right
way also. For in another passage 993 He finds fault with some persons, saying, “There is no
man to care for My soul.” He finds fault with some for not seeking after His soul; and again,
with others for seeking after it. Who is he that seeketh after His soul in the right way? He
who imitates His sufferings. Who are they that sought after His soul in the wrong way? Even
those who “prepared violence against Him,” and crucified Him.
18. He goes on: “Those who sought after My faults had spoken vanity.” What is, “sought
after My faults”? They sought after many things, and found them not. Perhaps He may have
meant this: “They sought for criminal charges against me.” For they sought for somewhat
to say against Him, and “they found not.”994 For they were seeking to find evil things to say
of “the Good;” crimes of the Innocent; When would they find such things in Him, who had
no sin? But because they had to seek for sins in Him who had no sin, it remained for them
to invent that which they could not find. Therefore, “those who sought after My faults have
spoken vanity,” i.e., untruth, “and imagined deceit all the day long;” that is, they meditated
treachery without intermission. You know how atrocious false-witness was borne against
the Lord, before He suffered. You know how atrocious false-witness was borne against Him,
even after His resurrection. For those soldiers who watched His sepulchre of whom Isaiah
spake, “I will appoint the wicked for His burial”995 (for they were wicked men, and would
not speak the truth, and being bribed they disseminated a lie), consider what “vanity” they
spake. They also were examined, and they said, “While we slept, His disciples came and
stole Him away.”996 This it is, “to speak vanity.” For if they were sleeping, how could they
know what had been done?

19. He saith then, “But I as a deaf man heard not” (ver. 13). He who replied not to what
He heard, did, as it were, not hear them. “But I as a deaf man heard not. And I was as a
dumb man that openeth not his mouth.” And he repeats the same things again.
“And I became as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs” (ver.
14). As if He had nothing to say unto them, as if He had nothing wherewith to reproach
them. Had He not already reproached them for many things? Had He not said many things,
and also said, “Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,”997 and many things besides? Yet when
He suffered, He said none of these things; not that He had not what to say, but He waited
for them to fulfil all things, and that all the prophecies might be fulfilled of Him, of whom
it had been said, “And as a sheep before her shearer is dumb, so openeth He not His
mouth.”998 It behoved Him to be silent in His Passion, though not hereafter to be silent in
Judgment. For He had come to be judged, then, who was hereafter coming to judge; and
who was for this reason to come with great power to judge, that He had been judged in great
humility.
20. “For in Thee, O Lord, do I hope; Thou wilt hear, O Lord, my God” (ver. 15). As if
it were said to Him, “Wherefore openedst thou not thy mouth? Wherefore didst Thou not
say, ‘Refrain’? Wherefore didst Thou not rebuke the unrighteous, while hanging on the
Cross?” He goes on and says, “For in Thee, O Lord, do I hope; Thou, O Lord my God, wilt
hear.” He warns you what to do, should tribulation haply befall. For you seek to defend
yourself, and perhaps your defence is not listened to by any one. Then are you confounded,
as if you had lost your cause; because you have none to defend or to bear testimony in your
favour. “Keep” but your “innocence” within, where no one can pervert thy cause. False-
witness has prevailed against you before men. Will it then prevail before God, where your
cause has to be pleaded? When God shall be Judge, there shall be no other witness than your
own conscience. In the presence of a just judge, and of your own conscience, fear nothing
but your own cause. If you have not a bad cause, you will have no accuser to dread; no false-
witness to confute, nor witness to the truth to look for. Do but bring into court a good
conscience, that you may say, “For in Thee, O Lord, do I hope; Thou, O Lord my God, wilt
hear.”
21. “For I said, Let not mine enemies ever rejoice over me. And when my feet slip, they
magnify themselves against me” (ver. 16). Again He returns to the infirmity of His Body:
and again the Head takes heed of Its “feet.” The Head is not in such a manner in Heaven,
as to forsake what It has on earth; He evidently sees and observes us. For sometimes, as is
the way of this life, our feet are “turned aside,” and they slip by falling into some sin; there
the tongues of the enemy rise up with the bitterest malignity. From this then we discern
997 Matt. xxiii. 13.
998 Isa. liii. 7.
Psalm XXXVIII
what they really had in view, even while they kept silence. Then they speak with an unsparing
harshness; rejoicing to have discovered what they ought to have grieved for. “And I said,
Lest at any time my adversaries should rejoice over me.” I said this indeed; and yet it was
perhaps for my correction that Thou hast caused them to “magnify themselves against me,
when my feet slipped;” that is to say, when I stumbled, they were elated, and said many
things. For pity, not insult, was due from them to the weak; even as the Apostle speaks:
“Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the
spirit of meekness;” and he combines the reason why: “considering thyself also, lest thou
also be tempted.”999 Not such as these were the persons of whom He speaks: “And when
my feet slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me;” but they were such as those of whom He
says elsewhere: “They that hate me will rejoice if I fall.”
22. “For I am prepared for the scourges” (ver. 17). Quite a magnificent expression; as
if He were saying, “It was even for this that I was born; that I might suffer.” For He was not
to be born,1000 but from Adam, to whom the scourge is due. But sinners are in this life
sometimes not scourged at all, or are scourged less than their deserts: because the wickedness
of their heart is given over as already desperate. Those, however, for whom eternal life is
prepared, must needs be scourged in this life: for that sentence is true: “My son, faint not
under the chastening of the Lord, neither be weary when thou art rebuked of Him.”1001
“For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”1002
Let not mine enemies therefore insult over me; let “them not magnify themselves;” and if
my Father scourgeth me, “I am prepared for the scourge;” because there is an inheritance
in store for me. Thou wilt not submit to the scourge: the inheritance is not bestowed upon
thee. For “every son” must needs be scourged. So true it is that “every son” is scourged, that
He spared not even Him who had no sin. For “I am prepared for the scourges.”
23. “And my sorrow is continually before me.” What “sorrow” is that? Perhaps, a sorrow
for my scourge. And, in good truth, my brethren, in good truth, let me say unto you, men
do mourn for their scourges, not for the causes on account of which they are scourged. Not
such was the person here. Listen, my brethren: If any person suffers any loss, he is more
ready to say, “I did not deserve to suffer it,” than to consider why he suffered it, mourning
the loss of money, not mourning over that of righteousness. If thou hast sinned, mourn for
the loss of thy inward treasure. Thou hast nothing in thy house, but perhaps thou art still
more empty in heart; but if thine heart is full of its Good, even thy God, why dost thou not
say, “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it pleased the Lord was it done. Blessed

Psalm XXXVIII
be the Name of the Lord.”1003 Whence then was it that He was grieving? Was it for the
“scourging” wherewith He was scourged? God forbid. “And my sorrow” (says He) “is con-
tinually before me.” And as if we were to say, “What sorrow? whence comes that sorrow?”
he says: “For I declare mine iniquity; and I will have a care for my sin” (ver. 18). See here
the reason for the sorrow! It is not a sorrow occasioned by the scourge; not one for the
remedy, not for the wound. For the scourge is a remedy against sins. Hear, brethren; We
are Christians, and yet if any one’s son dies, he mourns for him but does not mourn for him
if he sins. It is then, when he sees him sinning, that he ought to make mourning for him, to
lament over him. It is then he should restrain him, and give him a rule to live by; should
impose a discipline upon him: or if he has done so, and the other has not taken heed, then
was the time when he ought to have been mourned over; then he was more fatally dead
whilst living in luxury, than when, by death, he brought his luxury to its close: at that time,
when he was doing such things in thine house, he was not only “dead, but he stank also.”1004
These things were worthy to be lamented, the others were such as might well be endured;
those, I say, were tolerable, these worthy to be mourned over. They were to be mourned
over in the same way that you have heard this person mourn over them: “For I declare mine
iniquity. I will have a care for my sin.” Be not free from anxiety when you have confessed
your sin, as if always able to confess thy sin, and to commit it again. Do thou “declare thine
iniquity in such a manner, as to have a care for thy sin.” What is meant by “having a care
of thy sin”? To have a care of thy wound. If you were to say, “I will have a care of my wound,”
what would be meant by it, but I will do my endeavour to have it healed. For this is “to have
a care for one’s sin,” to be ever struggling, ever endeavouring, ever exerting one’s self,
earnestly and zealously, to heal one’s wound. Behold! thou art from day to day mourning
over thy sins; but perhaps thy tears indeed flow, but thy hands are unemployed. Do alms,
redeem1005 thy sins, let the poor rejoice of thy bounty, that thou also mayest rejoice of the
Grace of God. He is in want; so art thou in want also: he is in want at thy hands; so art thou
also in want at God’s hand. Dost thou despise one who needs thy aid; and shall God not
despise thee when thou needest His? Do thou therefore supply the needs of him who is in
want of thine aid; that God may supply thy needs within.1006 This is the meaning of, “I will
have a care for my sin.” I will do all that ought to be done, to blot out and to heal my sin.
“And I will have a care for my sin.”
24. “But mine enemies live” (ver. 19). They are well off: they rejoice in worldly
prosperity, while I am suffering, and “roaring with the groaning of my heart.” In what way

Psalm XXXVIII
do His enemies “live,” in that He hath said of them already, that they have “spoken vanity”?
Hear in another Psalm also: “Whose sons are as young plants; firmly rooted.” But above He
had said, “Whose mouth speaketh vanity. Their daughters polished after the similitude of
a temple: their garners full bursting forth more and more; their cattle fat, their sheep fruitful,
multiplying in their streets; no hedge falling into ruin; no cry in their streets.”1007 “Mine
enemies” then “live.” This is their life; this life they praise; this they set their hearts upon:
this they hold fast to their own ruin. For what follows? They pronounce “the people that is
in such a case” blessed. But what sayest thou, who “hast a care for thy sin”? What sayest
thou, who “confessest thine iniquity”? He says, “Blessed is the people whose God is the
Lord.”1008
“But mine enemies live, and are strengthened against me, and they that hate me
wrongfully are multiplied.” What is “hate me wrongfully”? They hate me, who wish their
good, whereas were they simply requiting evil for evil, they would not be righteous; were
they not to requite with good the good done to them, they would be ungrateful: they, however,
who “hate wrongfully,” actually return evil for good. Such were the Jews; Christ came unto
them with good things; they requited Him evil for good. Beware, brethren, of this evil; it
soon steals1009 upon us. Let no one of you think himself to be far removed from the danger,
because we said, “Such were the Jews.” Should a brother, wishing your good, rebuke you,
and you hate him, you are like them. And observe, how easily, how soon it is produced; and
avoid an evil so great, a sin so easily committed.
25. “They also that render evil for good, were speaking evil of me, because I have pursued
the thing that is just” (ver. 20). Therefore was it that I was requited evil for good. What is
meant by “pursued after the thing that is just”? Not forsaken it. That you might not always
understand persecutio in a bad sense, He means by persecutus pursued after, thoroughly
followed. “Because I have followed the thing that is just.” Hear also our Head crying with a
lamentable voice in His Passion: “And they cast Me forth, Thy Darling, even as a dead man
in abomination.”1010 Was it not enough that He was “dead”? wherefore “in abomination”
also? Because He was crucified. For this death of the Cross was a great abomination in their
eyes, as they did not perceive that it was spoken in prophecy, “Cursed is every one that
hangeth on a tree.”1011 For He did not Himself bring death; but He found it here, propagated
from the curse of the first man; and this same death of ours, which had originated in sin,
He had taken upon Himself, and hung on the Tree. Lest therefore some persons should

Psalm XXXVIII
think (as some of the Heretics think), that our Lord Jesus Christ had only a false body of
flesh; and that the death by which He made satisfaction on the Cross was not a real death,
the Prophet notices this, and says, “Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.” He shows
then that the Son of God died a true death, the death which was due to mortal flesh: lest if
He were not “accursed,” you should think that He had not truly died. But since that death
was not an illusion, but had descended from that original stock, which had been derived
from the curse, when He said, “Ye shall surely die:”1012 and since a true death assuredly
extended even to Him, that a true life might extend itself to us, the curse of death also did
extend to Him, that the blessing of life might extend even unto us. “And they cast Me forth,
Thy Darling, even as a dead man in abomination.”
26. “Forsake me not, O Lord; O my God, depart not from me” (ver. 21). Let us speak in
Him, let us speak through Him (for He Himself intercedeth for us), and let us say, “Forsake
me not, O Lord my God.” And yet He had said, “My God! My God! why hast Thou forsaken
Me?”1013 and He now says, “O My God, depart not from Me.” If He does not forsake the
body, did He forsake the Head? Whose words then are these but the First Man’s? To show
then that He carried about Him a true body of flesh derived from him, He says, “My God,
My God why hast Thou forsaken Me?” God had not forsaken Him. If He does not forsake
Thee, who believest in Him, could the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, One God, forsake
Christ? But He had transferred to Himself the person of the First Man. We know by the
words of an Apostle, that “our old man is crucified with Him.”1014 We should not, however,
be divested of our old nature, had He not been crucified “in weakness.” For it was to this
end that He came that we may be renewed in Him, because it is by aspiration after Him,
and by following the example of His suffering, that we are renewed. Therefore that was the
cry of infirmity; that cry, I mean, in which it was said, “Why hast Thou forsaken Me?” Thence
was it said in that passage above, “the words of mine offences.” As if He were saying, These
words are transferred to My Person from that of the sinner.
27. “Depart not from me. Make haste to help me, Lord of my salvation” (ver. 22). This
is that very “salvation,” Brethren, concerning which, as the Apostle Peter saith, “Prophets
have enquired diligently,”1015 and though they have enquired diligently, yet have not found
it. But they searched into it, and foretold of it; while we have come and have found what
they sought for. And see, we ourselves too have not as yet received it; and after us shall
others also be born, and shall find, what they also shall not receive, and shall pass away, that
we may, all of us together, receive the “penny of salvation in the end of the day,” with the

Prophets, the Patriarchs, and the Apostles. For you know that the hired servants, or labourers,
were taken into the vineyard at different times; yet did they all receive their wages on an
equal footing.1016 Apostles, then, and Prophets, and Martyrs, and ourselves also, and those
who will follow us to the end of the world, it is in the End itself that we are to receive ever-
lasting salvation; that beholding the face of God, and contemplating His Glory, we may
praise Him for ever, free from imperfection, free from any punishment of iniquity, free from
every perversion of sin: praising Him; and no longer longing after Him, but now clinging
to Him for whom we used to long to the very end, and in whom we did rejoice, in hope. For
we shall be in that City, where God is our Bliss, God is our Light, God is our Bread, God is
our Life; whatever good thing of ours there is, at being absent from which we now grieve,
we shall find in Him. In Him will be that “rest,” which when we “call to remembrance” now,
we cannot choose but grieve. For that is the “Sabbath” which we “call to remembrance;” in
the recollection of which, so great things have been said already; and so great things ought
to be said by us also, and ought never to cease being said by us, not with our lips indeed,
but in our heart: for therefore do our lips cease to speak, that we may cry out with our
hearts.1017

Psalm XXXVIII
Psalm XXXIX.1018
1. The title of this Psalm, which we have just chanted and proposed to discuss, is, “On
the end, for Idithun, a Psalm for David himself.” Here then we must look for, and must attend
to, the words of a certain person who is called Idithun; and if each one of ourselves may be
Idithun, in that which he sings he recognises himself, and hears himself speak. For thou
mayest see who was called Idithun, according to the ancient descent of man; let us, however,
understand what this name is translated, and seek to comprehend the Truth in the translation
of the word. According therefore to what we have been able to discover by enquiry in those
names which have been translated from the Hebrew tongue into the Latin, by those who
study the sacred writings, Idithun being translated is “over-leaping them.” Who then is this
person “over-leaping them”? or who those whom he hath “over-leaped”?…For there are
some persons, yet clinging to the earth, yet bowed down to the ground, yet setting their
hearts on what is below, yet placing their hopes in things that pass away, whom he who is
called “over-leaping them” hath “over-leaped.”
2. You know that some of the Psalms are entitled, “Songs of Degrees;” and in the Greek
it is obvious enough what the word ‡ναβαθμῶν means. For ‡ναβαθμοὶ are degrees (or steps)
of them that ascend, not of them that descend. The Latin, not being able to express it strictly,
expresses it by the general term; and in that it called them “steps,” left it undetermined,
whether they were “steps” of persons ascending or descending. But because there is no
“speech or language where their voices are not heard among them,”1019 the earlier language
explains the one which comes after it: and what was ambiguous in one is made certain in
another. Just then as there the singer is some one who is “ascending,” so here is it some one
who is “over-leaping.”…Let this Idithun come still to us, let him “over-leap” those whose
delight is in things below, and take delight in these things, and let him rejoice in the Word
of the Lord; in the delight of the law of the Most High.…
3. “I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue” (ver. 1).…For it is
not without reason that the tongue is set in a moist place, but because it is so prone to
slip.1020 Perceiving therefore how hard it was for a man to be under the necessity of speaking,
and not to say something that he will wish unsaid, and filled with disgust at these sins, he
seeks to avoid the like. To this difficulty is he exposed who is seeking to “leap beyond.”…Al-
though I have “leaped beyond” the pleasures of earth, although the fleeting1021 passions for
things temporal ensnare me not, though now I despise these things below, and am rising
up to better things than these, yet in these very better things the satisfaction of knowledge

Psalm XXXIX
in the sight of God is enough for me. Of what use is it for me to speak what is to be laid hold
of, and to give a handle to cavillers? Therefore, “I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I
sin not with my tongue. I keep my mouth with a bridle.” Wherefore is this? Is it on account
of the religious, the thoughtful, the faithful, the holy ones? God forbid! These persons hear
in such a manner, as to praise what they approve; but as for what they disapprove, perhaps,
among much that they praise they rather excuse than cavil at it; on account of what persons
then dost thou “take heed to thy ways,” and place a guard on thy lips “that thou mayest not
sin with thy tongue”? Hear: it is, “While the wicked standeth over against me.” It is not “by
me” that he takes up his station, but “against me.” Why?…Even the Lord Himself says, “I
have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.”1022 And the Apostle,
“I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.”1023 Yet not as to persons
to be despaired of, but as to those who still required to be nourished. For he goes on to say,
“As babes in Christ, I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not
able.” Well, tell it unto us even now. “Neither yet now are ye able.”1024 Be not therefore
impatient to hear that which as yet thou art not capable of; but grow that thou mayest be
“able to bear it.” It is thus we address the little one, who yet requires to be fed with kindly
milk1025 in the bosom of Mother Church, and to be rendered meet for the “strong meat”
of the Lord’s Table. But what can I say even of that kind to the sinner, who “taketh his stand
against me,” who either thinks or pretends himself capable of what he “cannot bear;” so that
when I say anything unto him, and he has failed to comprehend it, he should not suppose
that it was not he that had failed to comprehend, but I who had broken down. Therefore
because of this sinner, who “taketh up his stand against me, I keep my mouth as it were with
a bridle.”
4. “I became deaf, and was humbled, I held my peace from good” (ver. 2). For this person,
who is “leaping beyond,” suffers some difficulty in a certain stage to which he hath already
attained; and he desires to advance beyond, even from thence, to avoid this difficulty. I was
afraid of committing a sin; so that I spoke not; that I imposed on myself the necessity of si-
lence: for I had spoken thus, “I will take heed to my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue.”
Whilst I was too much afraid of saying anything wrong, I kept silence from all that is good.
For whence could I say good things, except that I heard them? “It is Thou that shalt make
me to hear of joy and gladness.”1026 And the “friend of the bridegroom standeth and heareth
Him, and rejoiceth on account of the bridegroom’s voice,”1027 not his own. That he may

speak true things, he hears what he is to say. For it is he that “speaketh a lie,” that “speaketh
of his own.”1028…When therefore I had “put a bridle,” as it were, “on my lips;” and con-
strained myself to silence, because I saw that everywhere speech was dangerous, then, says
he, that came to pass upon me, which I did not wish, “I became deaf, and was humbled;”
not humbled myself, but was humbled; “and I held my peace even from good.” Whilst afraid
of saying any evil, I began to refrain from speaking what is good: and I condemned my de-
termination; for “I was holding my peace even from what is good.”
“And my sorrow was stirred up again” (ver. 2). Inasmuch as I had found in silence a
kind of respite from a certain “sorrow,” that had been inflicted upon me by those who cavilled
at my words, and found fault with me: and that sorrow that was caused by the cavillers, had
ceased indeed; but when “I held my peace even from good, my sorrow was stirred up again.”
I began to be more grieved at having refrained from saying what I ought to have said, than
I had before been grieved by having said what I ought not. “And my sorrow was stirred up
again.”1029
5. “And while I was musing, the fire burned” (ver. 3).…I reflected on the words of my
Lord, “Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have put My money to the ex-
changers, and I at My coming should receive it again with usury.”1030 And that which follows
may God avert from those who are His stewards! Bind him hand and foot, and let him be
cast into outer darkness;1031 the servant, who was not a waster of his master’s goods, so as
to destroy them, but was slothful in laying them out to improve them. What ought they to
expect, who have wasted them in luxury, if they are condemned who through slothfulness
have kept them? “As I was musing, the fire burned.” And as he was in this state of wavering
suspense, between speaking and holding his peace, between those who are prepared to
cavil and those who are anxious to be instructed,…in this state of suspense, he prays for a
better place, a place different from this his present stewardship, in which man is in such
difficulty and in such danger, and sighing after a certain “end,” when he was not to be subject
to these things, when the Lord is to say to the faithful dispenser, “Enter thou into the joy of
thy Lord,”1032 he says, “Then spake I with my tongue.” In this fluctuation, in the midst of
these dangers and these difficulties, because, that in consequence of the abundance of offences
“the love of many is waxing cold,”1033 although the law of the Lord inspires delight, in this
fluctuation then, (I say), “then spake I with my tongue.” To whom? not to the hearer whom

I would fain instruct; but to Him who heareth and taketh heed also, by whom I would fain
be instructed myself. “I spake with my tongue” to Him, from whom I inwardly hear whatever
I hear that is good or true.—What saidst thou?
“Lord, make me to know mine end” (ver. 4). For some things I have passed by already;
and I have arrived at a certain point, and that to which I have arrived is better than that
from which I have advanced to this; but yet there remains a point, which has to be left behind.
For we are not to remain here, where there are trials, offences, where we have to bear with
persons who listen to us and cavil at us. “Make me to know mine end;” the end, from which
I am still removed, not the course which is already before me.
6. The “end” he speaks of, is that which the Apostle fixed his eye upon, in his course;
and made confession of his own infirmity, perceiving in himself a different state of things
from that which he looked for elsewhere. For he says, “Not that I have already attained, or
am already perfect. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended.”1034 And that you
might not say, “If the Apostle hath not apprehended, have I apprehended? If the Apostle is
not perfect, am I perfect?”…
7. “And the number of my days, what it is.” I ask of “the number of my days, what it
is.” I can speak of “number” without number, and understand “number without number,”
in the same sense as “years without years” may be spoken of. For where there are years,
there is a sort of “number” at all events, also. But yet, “Thou art the same, and Thy years
shall not fail.”1035 “Make me to know the number of my days;” but “to know what it is.”
What then? that number in which thou art, think you that it “is” not? Assuredly, if I weigh
the matter well, it has no being; if I linger behind, it has a sort of being; if I rise above it, it
has none. If, shaking off the trammels of these things, I contemplate things above, if I compare
things that pass away with those that endure, I see what has a true being, and what rather
seems to be, than really is. Should I say that these days of mine “are;” and shall I rashly apply
this word so full of meaning to this course of things passing away? To such a degree have I
my own self almost ceased to “be, failing” as I am in my weakness, that He escaped from
my memory, who said, “I AM HE THAT IS.”1036 Hath then any number of days any exist-
ence? In truth it hath, and it is “number without end.”…Everything is swept on by a series
of moments, fleeting by, one after the other; there is a torrent of existences ever flowing on
and on; a “torrent,”1037 of which He “drank in the way,” who hath now “lift up His Head.”
These days then have no true being; they are gone almost before they arrive; and when they
are come, they cannot continue; they press upon one another, they follow the one the other,

1035 Ps. cii. 27.
1036 Exod. iii. 14.

Psalm XXXIX
and cannot check themselves in their course. Of the past nothing is called back again; what
is yet to be, is expected as something to pass away again: it is not as yet possessed, whilst as
yet it is not arrived; it cannot be kept when once it has arrived. He asks then concerning
“the number of his days, which is;” not that which is “not:” and (which confounds me by a
still greater and more perplexing difficulty) at once “is,” and “is not.” We can neither say
that “is,” which does not continue; nor that it “is not,” when it has come and is passing. It
is that absolute “IS,” that true “IS,” that “IS” in the true sense of the word, that I long for;
that “IS;” which “is” in that “Jerusalem” which is “the Bride” of my Lord;1038 where there
will not be death, there will not be failing; there will be a day that passeth not away, but
continueth: which has neither a yesterday to precede it, nor a to-morrow pressing close
upon it.1039 This “number of my days, which is,” this (I say), “make Thou me to know.”
8. “That I may know what is wanting to me.” For while I am struggling here, “this” is
wanting unto me: and so long as it is wanting unto me, I do not call myself perfect. So long
as I have not received it, I say, “not that I have already attained, either am already perfect;
but I am pressing towards the prize of God’s high calling.”1040 This let me receive as the
prize of my running the race! There will be a certain resting-place, to terminate my course;
and in that resting-place there will be a Country, and no pilgrimage, no dissension, no
temptation. Make me then to know “this number of my days, which is, that I may know
what is wanting unto me;” because I am not there yet; lest I should be made proud of what
I already am, that “I may be found in Him, not having mine own righteousness.” 1041…
9. “Behold, thou hast made my days old”1042 (ver. 5). For these days are “waxing old.”
I long for new days “that never shall wax old,” that I may say, “Old things have passed away;
behold, things are become new.”1043 Already new in hope; then in reality. For though, in
hope and in faith, made new already, how much do we even now do after our old nature!
For we are not so completely “clothed upon” with Christ, as not to bear about with us any-
thing derived from Adam. Observe that Adam is “waxing old” within us, and Christ is being
“renewed” in us. “Though our outward man is perishing, yet is our inward man being re-
newed day by day.”1044 Therefore, while we fix our thoughts on sin, on mortality, on time,
that is hastening by, on sorrow, and toil, and labour, on stages of life following each other
in succession, and continuing not, passing on insensibly from infancy even to old age; whilst,

Psalm XXXIX
I say, we fix our eyes on these things, let us see here “the old man,” the “day that is waxing
old;” the Song that is out of date; the Old Testament;1045 when however we turn to the inner
man, to those things that are to be renewed in place of these which are to be changed, let us
find the “new man,” the “new day,” the “new song,” the “New Testament;” and that “new-
ness,” let us so love, as to have no fears of its “waxing old.”…This man, therefore, who is
hasting forward to those things which are new, and “reaching forward to those things which
are before,” says, “Lord, make me to know mine end, and the number of my days, which
really is, that I may know what is wanting unto me.” See he still drags with him Adam; and
even so he is hasting unto Christ. “Behold,” saith he, “thou hast made my days old.” It is
those days that are derived from Adam, those days, I say, that thou hast made old. They are
waxing old day by day: and so waxing old, as to be at some day or other consumed also.
“And my substance is as nothing before Thee.”1046 “Before Thee, O Lord, my substance is
as nothing.” “Before Thee;” who seest this; and I too, when I see it, see it only when “before
Thee.”
When “before men” I see it not. For what shall I say? What words shall I use to show,
that which I now am is nothing in comparison of That which truly “IS”? But it is within that
it is said;1047 it is within that it is felt, so far as it is felt. “Before Thee, O Lord,” where Thine
eyes are; and not where the eyes of men are. And where Thine eyes are, what is the state of
things? “That which I am is as nothing.”
10. “But, verily, every man living is altogether vanity.” “But, verily.” For what was he
saying above? Behold, I have already “leaped beyond” all mortal things, and despised things
below, have trampled under foot the things of earth, have soared upwards to the delights of
the law of the Lord, I have been afloat in the dispensation of the Lord,1048 have yearned for
that “End” which Itself is to know no end, have yearned for the number of my days that
truly “is,” because the number of days like these hath no real being. Behold, I am already
such a one as this; I have already overleaped so much; I am longing for those things which
abide. “But verily,” in the state in which I am here, so long as I am here, so long as I am in
this world, so long as I bear mortal flesh, so long as the life of man on earth is a trial, so long
as I sigh among causes of offence, as long as while I “stand” I am in “fear lest I fall,”1049 as

long as both my good and my ill hangs in uncertainty, “every man living is altogether van-

11. “Albeit man walketh in the Image”1050 (ver. 6). In what “Image,” save that of Him
who said, “Let Us make man in Our Image, after Our Likeness.”1051 “Albeit man walks in
the Image.” For the reason he says “albeit,” is, that this is some great thing. And this “albeit”
is followed by “nevertheless,” that the “albeit” which you have already heard, should relate
to what is beyond the sun; but this “nevertheless,” which is to follow, to what is “under the
sun,” and that the one should relate to the Truth, the other to “vanity.” “Albeit,” then, “that
man walketh in the Image, nevertheless he is disquieted in vain.” Hear the cause of his
“disquieting,” and see if it be not a vain one; that thou mayest trample it under foot, that
thou mayest “leap beyond it,” and mayest dwell on high, where that “vanity” is not. What
“vanity” is that? “He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not for whom he may be gathering
them together.” O infatuated vanity! “Blessed is the man that maketh the Lord his trust, and
hath not respected vanities, nor lying deceits.”1052 To you indeed, O covetous man, to you
I seem to be out of my senses, these words appear to you to be “old wives’ tales.” For you,
a man of great judgment, and of great prudence, to be sure, are daily devising methods of
acquiring money, by traffic, by agriculture, by eloquence perhaps, by making yourself learned
in the law, by warfare, perhaps you even add that of usury. Like a shrewd man as you are,
you leave nothing untried, whereby you may pile coin on coin; and may store it up1053 more
carefully in a place of secrecy. You plunder others; you guard against the plunderer; you are
afraid lest you should yourself suffer the wrong, that you yourself do; and even what you
do suffer, does not correct you.…Examine your own heart, and that prudence of yours,
which leads you to deride me, to think me out of my senses for saying these things: and tell
me now, “You are heaping up treasures; for whom are you gathering them together?” I see
what you would tell me; as if what you would say had not occurred to the person described
here; you will say, I am keeping them for my children? This is the voice of parental affection;
the excuse of injustice. “I am keeping them” (you say) “for my children.” So then you are
keeping them for your children, are you? Did not Idithun then know this? Assuredly he did;

as Martial, Et cujus laxas arca flagellat opes, and the Jurisconsults flagellare annonam, for “to shut up.”—Ben.
Flagellare annonam, however, seems rather to mean to “drive up the prices,” and perhaps arca flagellat may be
the lid striking the heaped contents, thus affording no parallel. However, it may be to “keep it from peeping
out.” Oxf. mss. cartigetur.
Psalm XXXIX
but he reckoned it one of the things of the “old days,” that have waxed old, and therefore
he despised it: because he was hastening on to the new “days.”…
12. For He, “by whom all things were made,”1054 hath built “mansions” for all of us:
thither He would have that which we have go before us; that we may not lose it1055 on earth.
When, however, you have kept them on earth, tell me for whom you are to “gather them
together”? You have children: add one more to their number; and give something to Christ
also. “He is disquieted in vain.”
13. “And now” (ver. 7). “And now,” saith this Idithun,—looking back on a certain “vain”
show, and looking up to a certain Truth, standing midway where he has something beyond
him, and something also behind him, having below him the place from which he took his
spring, having above him that toward which he has stretched forth;—“And now,” when I
have “over-leaped” some things, when I have trampled many things under foot, when I am
no longer captivated by things temporal; even now, I am not perfect, “I have not yet appre-
hended.”1056 “For it is by hope that we are saved; but hope that is seen is not hope; for what
a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with
patience wait for it.”1057 Therefore he says: “And now what wait I for? Is it not for the
Lord?”1058 He is my expectation, who hath given me all those things, that I might despise
them. He will give unto me Himself also, even He who is above all, and “by whom all things
were made,”1059 and by whom I was made amongst all; even He, the Lord, is my Expectation!
You see Idithun, brethren, you see in what way he waiteth for Him! Let no man therefore
call himself perfect here; he deceives and imposes upon himself; he is beguiling himself, he
cannot have perfection here, and what avails it that he should lose humility?…
“And my substance is ever before Thee.” Already advancing, already tending towards
Him, and to some extent already beginning to “be,” still (he says1060) “my substance is ever
before Thee.” Now that other substance is also before men. You have gold, silver, slaves,
estates, trees, cattle, servants. These things are visible even to men. There is a certain “sub-
stance that is ever before Thee.”
14. “Deliver me from all my transgressions” (ver. 8). I have “over-leaped” a great deal

“beat my breast,” and say, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”1062 Thou
therefore art “my expectation!” my “End.” For “Christ is the end of the Law unto righteous-
ness, unto every man that believeth.”1063 From all mine offences: not only from those, that
I may not relapse into those which I have already “over-leaped;” but from all, without excep-
tion, of those on account of which I now beat my breast, and say, “Forgive us our debts.”
“Deliver me from all mine offences:” me being thus minded, and holding fast what the
Apostle said, “As many of us as be perfect, let us be thus minded.”1064 For at the time that
he said that he was not “already perfect,” he then immediately goes on and says, “As many
of us as be perfect, let us be thus minded.”…Art thou then, O Apostle, not perfect, and are
we perfect? But hath it escaped you, that he did just now call himself “perfect”? For he does
not say, “As many of you as are perfect, be ye thus minded;” but “As many of us as be perfect,
let us be thus minded;” after having said a little before, “Not that I have already attained;
either am already perfect.” In no other way then can you be perfect in this life, than by
knowing that you cannot be perfect in this life. This then will be your perfection, so to have
“over-leaped” some things, as to have still some point to which you are hastening on: so as
to have something remaining, to which you will have to leap on, when everything else has
been passed by. It is such faith as this that is secure; for whoever thinks that he has already
attained, is “exalting himself,” so as to be “abased” hereafter.1065…
15. “Thou hast made me the reproach of the foolish.” Thou hast so willed it, that I should
live among those, and preach the Truth among those, who love vanity; and I cannot but be
a laughing-stock to them. “For we have been made a spectacle unto this world, and unto
angels, and unto men:”1066 to angels who praise, to men who censure, us; or rather to angels,
some of whom praise, some of whom are censuring us: and to men also, some of whom are
praising, and some censuring us.…Both the one and the other are arms to us: the one “on
the right hand,” the other “on the left:” arms however they are both of them; both of these
kinds of arms, both those “on the right hand,” and those “on the left;” both those who praise,
and those who censure; both those who pay us honour, and those who heap dishonour upon
us; with both these kinds I contend against the devil; with both of these I smite him; I defeat
him with prosperity, if I be not corrupted by it; by adversity, if I am not broken in spirit by
it.

should I tell what is going on within me? “For I will hear what the Lord God will speak in
me;1068 for He will speak peace unto His people.”1069 But “There is no peace,” saith the
Lord, “to the wicked.”1070 “I was dumb, and opened not my mouth; because it is Thou that
madest me.” Was this the reason that thou openedst not thy mouth, “because God made
thee”? That is strange; for did not God make thy mouth, that thou shouldest speak? “He
that planted the ear, doth He not hear? He that formed the eye, doth He not see?”1071 God
hath given thee a mouth to speak with; and dost thou say, “I was dumb, and opened not my
mouth, because Thou madest me”? Or does the clause, “Because Thou madest me,” belong
to the verse that follows? “Remove Thy stroke away from me” (ver. 10). Because it is “Thou
that hast made me,” let it not be Thy pleasure to destroy me utterly; scourge, so that I may
be made better, not so that I faint; beat me, so that I may be1072 beaten out to a greater
length and breadth, not so that I may be ground to powder. “By the heaviness of Thy hand
I fainted in corrections.” That is, I “fainted” while Thou wast correcting me. And what is
meant by “correcting” me? except what follows.
17. “Thou with rebukes hast chastened man for iniquity; Thou hast made my life to
consume away like a spider” (ver. 11). There is much that is discerned by this Idithun; by
every one who discerns as he does; who overleaps as he does. For he says, that he has fainted
in God’s corrections; and would fain have the stroke removed away from him, “because it
is He who made him.” Let Him renew me, who also made me; let Him who created me,
create me anew. But yet, Brethren, do we suppose that there was no cause for his fainting,
so that he wishes to be “renewed,” to be “created anew”? It is “for iniquity,” saith he, “that
Thou hast chastened man.” All this, my having fainted, my being weak, my “crying out of
the deep,” all of this is because of “iniquity;” and in this Thou hast not condemned, but hast
“chastened” me. “Thou hast chastened man for sin.” Hear this more plainly from another
Psalm: “It is good for me that Thou hast afflicted me, that I might learn Thy righteous-
ness.”1073 I have been “afflicted,” and at the same time “it is good for me;” it is at once a
punishment, and an act of favour. What hath He in store for us after punishment is over,
who inflicts punishment itself by way of favour? For He it is of whom it was said, “I was
brought low, and He made me whole:” and, “It is good for me that Thou hast afflicted me,
that I might learn Thy righteousness.”1074 “Thou chastenest man for iniquity.” And that

Psalm XXXIX
which is written, “Thou formest my grief in teaching me,”1075 could only be said unto God
by one who was “leaping beyond” his fellows; “Thou formest my grief in teaching me;” Thou
makest, that is to say, a lesson for me out of my sorrow. It is Thou that formest that very
grief itself; Thou dost not leave it unformed, but formest it; and that grief, that has been in-
flicted by Thee, when formed, will be a lesson unto me, that I may be set free by Thee. For
the word finges is used in the sense of “forming,” as it were moulding, my grief; not in the
sense of “feigning” it; in the same way that fingit is applied to the artist, in the same sense
that figulus is derived from fingere. Thou therefore “hast chastened man for iniquity.” I see
myself in afflictions; I see myself under punishment; and I see no unrighteousness in Thee.
If I therefore am under punishment, and if there is no unrighteousness with Thee, it remains
that Thou must have been “chastening man for iniquity.”
18. And by what means hast Thou “chastened” him? Tell us, O Idithun, the manner of
thy chastening; tell us in what way thou hast been “chastened.” “And Thou hast made my
life consume like a spider.” This is the chastening! What consumes away sooner than the
spider? I speak of the creature itself; though what can be more liable to “consume away”
than the spider’s webs? Observe too how liable to decay is the creature itself. Do but set your
finger lightly upon it, and it is a ruin: there is nothing at all more easily destroyed. To such
a state hast Thou brought my life, by chastening me “because of iniquity.” When chastening
makes us weak, there is a kind of strength that would be a fault.…It was by a kind of strength
that man offended, so as to require to be corrected by weakness: for it was by a certain
“pride” that he offended; so as to require to be chastened by humility. All proud persons
call themselves strong men. Therefore have many “come from the East and the West,” and
have attained “to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of Heav-
en.”1076 Wherefore was it that they so attained? Because they would not be strong. What is
meant by “would not be strong”? They were afraid to presume of their own merits. They
did not “go about to establish their own righteousness,” that they might “submit themselves
to the righteousness of God.”1077…Behold! you are mortal; and you bear about you a body
of flesh that is corrupting away: “And ye shall fall like one of the princes. Ye shall die like
men,”1078 and shall fall like the devil.1079 What good does the remedial discipline of mor-
tality do you? The devil is proud, as not having a mortal body, as being an angel. But as for
you, who have received a mortal body, and to whom even this does no good, so as to humble
you by so great weakness, you shall “fall like one of the princes.” This then is the first grace

of God’s gift, to bring us to the confession of our infirmity, that whatever good we can do,
whatever ability we have, we may be that in Him; that “He that glorieth, may glory in the
Lord.”1080 “When I am weak,” saith he, “then am I strong.”1081
19. “But surely every man living disquieteth himself in vain.” He returns to what he
mentioned a little before. Although he be improving here, yet for all that, “every man living
disquieteth himself in vain;” forasmuch as he lives in a state of uncertainty. For who has
any assurance even of his own goodness? “He is disquieted in vain.” Let him “cast upon the
Lord the burden”1082 of his care; let him cast upon Him whatever causes him anxiety. “Let
Him sustain thee;” let Him keep thee. For on this earth what is there that is certain, except
death? Consider the whole sum of all the good or the ill of this life, either those belonging
to righteousness, or those belonging to unrighteousness; what is there that is certain here,
except death? Have you been advancing in goodness? You know what you are to-day; what
you will be to-morrow, you know not! Are you a sinner? you know what you are to-day;
what you will be to-morrow, you know not! You hope for wealth; it is uncertain whether it
will fall to your lot. You hope to have a wife; it is uncertain whether you will obtain one, or
what sort of one you will obtain. You hope for sons: it is uncertain whether they will be born
to you. Are they born? it is uncertain whether they will live: if they live, it is uncertain
whether they will grow up in virtue, or whether they will fall away. Whichever way you turn,
all is uncertain, death alone is certain. Art thou poor? It is uncertain whether thou wilt grow
rich. Art thou unlearned? It is uncertain whether thou wilt become learned. Art thou in
feeble health, it is uncertain whether thou wilt regain thy strength. Art thou born? It is certain
that thou wilt die: and in this certainty of death itself, the day of thy death is uncertain.
Amidst these uncertainties, where death alone is certain, while even of that the hour is un-
certain, and while it alone is studiously guarded against, though at the same time it is in no
way to be escaped, “every man living disquieteth himself in vain.”…
20. “Hear my prayer, O Lord” (ver. 12). Whereof shall I rejoice? Whereof should I groan?
I rejoice on account of what is past, I groan longing for these which are not yet come. “Hear
my prayer, and give ear unto my cry. Hold not Thy peace at my tears.” For do I now no
longer weep, because I have already “passed by,” have “left behind” so great things as these?
“Do I not weep much the more?” For, “He that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.”1083
The more I long for what is not here, do I not so much the more groan for it until it comes?
do I not so much the more weep until it comes?…

Psalm XXXIX
21. “For I am a sojourner with Thee.” But with whom am I a “sojourner”? When I was
with the devil, I was a “sojourner;” but then I had a bad host and entertainer; now, however,
I am with Thee; but I am a “sojourner” still. What is meant by a sojourner? I am a “sojourner”
in the place from which I am to remove; not in the place where I am to dwell for ever. The
place where I am to abide for ever, should be rather called my home. In the place from which
I am to remove I am a “sojourner;” but yet it is with my God that I am a sojourner, with
whom I am hereafter to abide, when I have reached my home. But what home is that to
which you are to remove from this estate of a sojourner? Recognise that home, of which the
Apostle speaks, “We have an habitation of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in
the Heavens.”1084 If this house is eternal in the Heavens, when we have come to it, we shall
not be sojourners any more. For how should you be a sojourner in an eternal home? But
here, where the Master of the house is some day to say to you, “Remove,” while you yourself
know not when He will say it, be thou in readiness. And by longing for your eternal home,
you will be keeping yourself in readiness for it. And be not angry with Him, because He
gives thee notice to remove, when He Himself pleases. For He made no covenant with thee,
nor did He bind Himself by any engagement; nor didst thou enter upon the tenancy of this
house on a certain stipulation for a definite term: thou art to quit, when it is its Master’s
pleasure. For therefore is it that you now dwell there free of charge. “For I am a sojourner
with Thee, and a stranger.” Therefore it is there is my country: it is there is my home. “I am
a sojourner with Thee, and a stranger.” Here too is understood “with Thee.” For many are
strangers with the devil: but they who have already believed and are faithful, are, it is true,
“strangers” as yet, because they have not yet come to that country and to that home: but
still they are strangers with God. For so long as we are in the body, we are strangers from
the Lord, and we desire, whether we are strangers, or abiding here, “we may be accepted
with Him.”1085 I am a “sojourner with Thee; and a stranger, as all my fathers were.” If then
I am as all my fathers were, shall I say that I will not remove, when they have removed? Am
I to lodge here on other terms, than those on which they lodged here also?…
22. “Grant me some remission, that I may be refreshed before I go hence” (ver. 13).
Consider well, Idithun, consider what knots those are which thou wouldest have “loosed”
unto thee, that thou mightest be “refreshed before thou goest hence.” For thou hast certain
fever-heats from which thou wouldest fain be refreshed, and thou sayest, “that I may be re-
freshed,” and “grant me a remission.” What should He remit, or loosen unto thee, save that
difficulty under which, and in consequence of which, thou sayest, “Forgive us our debts.
Grant me a remission before I go hence, and be no more.” Set me free from my sins, “before
1084 2 Cor. v. 1.
1085 2 Cor. v. 9.
Psalm XXXIX
I go hence,” that I may not go hence with my sins. Remit them unto me, that I may be set
at rest in my conscience, that it may be disburthened of its feverish anxiety, the anxiety with
which “I am sorry for my sin. Grant me a remission, that I may be refreshed” (before
everything else), “before I go hence, and be no more.” For if thou grantest me not a “remis-
sion, that I may be refreshed,” I shall “go and be no more.” “Before I go” thither, where if I
go, I shall thenceforth “be no more. Grant me a remission, that I may be refreshed.” A
question has suggested itself, how he will be no more.…What is meant then by “shall be no
more,” unless Idithun is alluding to what is true “being,” and what is not true “being.” For
he was beholding with the mind, with which he could do so, with the “mind’s eye,” by which
he was able to behold it, that end, which he had desired to have shown unto him, saying,
“Lord, make me to know mine end.” He was beholding “the number of his days, which truly
is;” and he observed that all that is below, in comparison of that true being, has no true being.
For those things are permanent; these are subject to change; mortal, and frail, and the
eternal suffering, though full of corruption, is for this very reason not to be ended, that it
may ever be being ended without end. He alluded therefore to that realm of bliss, to the
happy country, to the happy home, where the Saints are partakers of eternal Life, and of
Truth unchangeable; and he feared to “go” where that is not, where there is no true being;
longing to be there, where “Being” in the highest sense is! It is on account of this contrast
then, while standing midway between them, he says, “Grant me a remission, that I may be
refreshed before I go hence and be no more.” For if Thou “grantest me not a remission” of
my sins, I shall go from Thee unto all eternity! And from whom shall I go to all eternity?
From Him who said, I Am HE that Am: from Him who said, “Say unto the children of Israel,
I Am hath sent me unto you.”1086 He then who goes from Him, in the contrary direction,
goes to non-existence.…
1086 Ex. iii. 14.
Psalm XXXIX
Psalm XL.1087
1. Of all those things which our Lord Jesus Christ has foretold, we know part to have
been already accomplished, part we hope will be accomplished hereafter. All of them,
however, will be fulfilled, because He is “the Truth” who speaks them, and requires of us to
be as “faithful,” as He Himself speaks them faithfully.…
2. Let us say then what this Psalm says. “I waited patiently for the Lord” (ver. 1). I waited
patiently for the promise of no mere mortal who can both deceive and be himself deceived:
I waited for the consolation of no mere mortal, who may be consumed by sorrow of his
own, before he gives me comfort. Should a brother mortal attempt to comfort me, when he
himself is in sorrow likewise? Let us mourn in company; let us weep together, let us “wait
patiently” together, let us join our prayers together also. Whom did I wait for but for the
Lord? The Lord, who though He puts off the fulfilment of His promises, yet never recalls
them? He will make it good; assuredly He will make it good, because He has made many of
His promises good already: and of God’s truth we ought to have no fears, even if as yet He
had made none of them good. Lo! let us henceforth think thus, “He has promised us
everything; He has not as yet given us possession of anything; He is a sponsible Promiser;
a faithful Paymaster: do you but show yourself a dutiful exactor of what is promised; and if
you be “weak,” if you be one of the little ones, claim the promise of His mercy. Do you not
see tender1088 lambs striking their dams’ teats with their heads, in order that they may get
their fill of milk?…“And He took heed unto me, and heard my cry.” He took heed to it, and
He heard it. See thou hast not waited in vain. His eyes are over thee. His ears turned towards
thee. For, “the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open unto their
cry.”1089 What then? Did He not see thee, when thou usedst to do evil and to blaspheme
Him? What then becomes of what is said in that very Psalm, “The face of the Lord is upon
them that do evil”?1090 But for what end? “that He may cut off the remembrance of them
from the earth.” Therefore, even when thou wert wicked, He “took heed of thee;” but He
“took no heed to thee.”1091 So then to him who “waited patiently for the Lord,” it was not
enough to say, “He took heed of me, He says, “He took heed to me;” that is, He took heed
by comforting me, that He might do me good. What was it that He took heed to? “and He
heard my cry.”
3. And what hath He accomplished for thee? What hath He done for thee? “He brought
me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and estab-

lished my goings” (ver. 2). He hath given us great blessings already: and still He is our
debtor; but let him who hath this part of the debt repaid already, believe that the rest will
be also, seeing that he ought to have believed even before he received anything. Our Lord
has employed facts themselves to persuade us, that He is a faithful promiser, a liberal giver.
What then has He already done? “He has brought me out of a horrible pit.” What horrible
pit is that? It is the depth of iniquity, from the lusts of the flesh, for this is meant by “the
miry clay.”1092 Whence hath He brought thee out? Out of a certain deep, out of which thou
criedst out in another Psalm, “Out of the deep have I called unto Thee, O Lord.”1093 And
those who are already “crying out of the deep,” are not absolutely in the lowest deep: the
very act of crying is already lifting them up. There are some deeper in the deep, who do not
even perceive themselves to be in the deep. Such are those who are proud despisers, not pious
entreaters for pardon; not tearful criers for mercy: but such as Scripture thus describes. “The
sinner1094 when he comes into the depth of evil despiseth.”1095 For he is deeper in the deep,
who is not satisfied with being a sinner, unless instead of confessing he even defends his
sins. But he who has already “cried out of the deep,” hath already lifted up his head in order
that he might “cry out of the deep,” has been heard already, and has been “brought out of
the horrible pit, and out of the mire and clay.” He already has faith, which he had not before;
he has hope, which he was before without; he now walks in Christ, who before used to go
astray in the devil. For on that account it is that he says, “He hath set my feet upon a rock,
and established my goings.” Now “that Rock was Christ.”1096 Supposing that we are “upon
the rock,” and that our “goings are ordered,” still it is necessary that we continue to walk;
that we advance to something farther. For what did the Apostle Paul say when now upon
the Rock, when his “goings had now been established”? “Not as though I had already attained,
either were already perfect: Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended.”1097 What
then has been done for thee, if thou hast not apprehended? On what account dost thou return
thanks, saying, “But I have obtained mercy”?1098 Because his goings are now established,
because he now walks on the Rock?…Therefore, when he was saying, “I press forward toward
the prize of my high calling,” because “his feet were now set on the Rock,” and “his goings
were ordered,” because he was now walking on the right way, he had something to return
1092 Or thus, “What horrible pit is that? It is the depth of iniquity. From the lusts of the flesh, for this is
meant by the ‘miry clay.’”

thanks for; something to ask for still; returning thanks for what he had received already,
while he was claiming that which still remained due. For what things already received was
he giving thanks? For the remission of sins, for the illumination of faith; for the strong
support of hope, for the fire of charity. But in what respects had he still a claim of debt on
the Lord? “Henceforth,” he says, “there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.” There
is therefore something due me still. What is it that is due? “A crown of righteousness, which
the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.” He was at first a loving Father to
“bring him forth from the horrible pit;” to forgive his sins, to rescue him from “the mire
and clay;” hereafter he will be a “righteous Judge,” requiting to him walking rightly, what
He promised; to him (I say), unto whom He had at the first granted that power to walk
rightly. He then as a “righteous Judge” will repay; but whom will he repay? “He that endureth
unto the end, the same shall be saved.”1099
4. “And He hath put a new song in my mouth.” What new song is this? “Even a hymn
unto our God” (ver. 3). Perhaps you used to sing hymns to strange gods; old hymns, because
they were uttered by the “old man,” not by the “new man;” let the “new man” be formed,
and let him sing a “new song;” being himself made “new,” let him love those “new” things
by which he is himself made new. For what is more Ancient than God, who is before all
things, and is without end and without beginning? He becomes “new” to thee, when thou
returnest to Him; because it was by departing from Him, that thou hadst become old; and
hadst said, “I have waxed old because of all mine enemies.”1100 We therefore utter “a hymn
unto our God;” and the hymn itself sets us free. “For I will call upon the Lord to praise Him,
and I will be safe from all mine enemies.” For a hymn is a song of praise. Call on God to
“praise” Him, not to find fault with Him.…
5. If haply any one asks, what person is speaking in this Psalm? I would say briefly, “It
is Christ.” But as ye know, brethren, and as we must say frequently, Christ sometimes speaks
in His own Person, in the Person of our Head. For He Himself is “the Saviour of the
Body.”1101 He is our Head; the Son of God, who was born of the Virgin, suffered for us,
“rose again for our justification,” sitteth “at the right hand of God,” to “make intercession
for us:”1102 who is also to recompense to the evil and to the good, in the judgment, all the
evil and the good that they have done. He deigned to be come our Head; to become “the
Head of the Body,” by taking of us that flesh in which He should die for us; that flesh which
He also raised up again for our sakes, that in that flesh He might place before us an instance
1099 Matt. x. 22.
1100 Ps. vi. 7.

1102 Rom. viii. 34.
Psalm XL
of the resurrection; that we might learn to hope for that of which we heretofore despaired,
and might henceforth have our feet upon the rock, and might walk in Christ. He then
sometimes speaks in the name of our Head; sometimes also He speaks of us who are His
members. For both when He said, “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me meat,”1103 He spoke
on behalf of His members, not of Himself: and when He said, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou Me?”1104 the Head was crying on behalf of its members: and yet He did not say, “Why
dost thou persecute My members?” but, “Why persecutest thou Me?” If He suffers in us,
then shall we also be crowned in Him. Such is the love of Christ. What is there can be
compared to this? This is the thing on account of which “He hath put a hymn in our mouth,”
and this He speaks on behalf of His members.
6. “The just shall see, and shall fear, and shall trust in the Lord.” “The just shall see.”
Who are the just? The faithful; because it is “by faith that the just shall live.”1105 For there
is in the Church this order, some go before, others follow; and those who go before make
themselves “an example” to those who follow; and those who follow imitate those who go
before. But do those then follow no one, who exhibit themselves as an ensample to them
that come after? If they follow no one at all, they will fall into error. These persons then
must themselves also follow some one, that is, Christ Himself.…“The just,” therefore, “shall
see, and shall fear.” They see a narrow way on the one hand; on the other side, “a broad
road:” on this side they see few, on the other many. But thou art a just man; count them not,
but weigh them; bring “a just balance,” not a “deceitful” one: because thou art called just.
“The just shall see, and fear,” applies to thee. Count not therefore the multitudes of men
that are filling the “broad ways,” that are to fill the circus tomorrow; celebrating with shouts
the City’s Anniversary, 1106 while they defile the City itself by evil living. Look not at them;
they are many in number; and who can count them? But there are a few travelling along the
narrow road. Bring forth the balance, I say. Weigh them; see what a quantity of chaff you
lift up on the one side, against a few grains of corn on the other. Let this be done by “the
just,” the “believers,” who are to follow. And what shall they who precede do? Let them not
be proud, let them not “exalt themselves;” let them not deceive those who follow them. How
may they deceive those who follow them? By promising them salvation in themselves. What
then ought those who follow to do? “The just shall see, and fear: and shall trust in the Lord;”
not in those who go before them. But indeed they fix their eyes on those who go before
them, and follow and imitate them; but they do so, because they consider from Whom they
have received the grace to go before them; and because they trust in Him. 1107 Although

therefore they make these their models, they place their trust in Him from whom the others
have received the grace whereby they are such as they are. “The just shall see it, and fear,
and shall trust in the Lord.” Just as in another Psalm, “I lift up mine eyes unto the hills,”1108
we understand by hills, all distinguished and great spiritual persons in the Church; great in
solidity, not by swollen inflation. By these it is that all Scripture hath been dispensed unto
us; they are the Prophets, they are the Evangelists; they are sound Doctors: to these “I lift
up mine eyes, from whence shall come my help.” And lest you should think of mere human
help, he goes on to say, “My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. The
just shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.”…
7. “Blessed is that man that maketh the name of the Lord his trust, and hath not respected
vanities or lying madnesses” (ver. 4). Behold the way by which thou wouldest fain have
gone. Behold the “multitude that fill the Broad way.”1109 It is not without reason “that” road
leads to the amphitheatre. It is not without reason it leads to Death. The “broad way” leads
unto death,1110 its breadth delights for time: its end is straitness to all eternity. Aye; but the
multitudes murmur; the multitudes are rejoicing together; the multitudes are hastening
along; the multitudes are flocking together! Do not thou imitate them; do not turn aside
after them: they are “vanities, and lying madnesses.” Let the Lord thy God be thy hope. Hope
for nothing else from the Lord thy God; but let the Lord thy God Himself be thine hope.
For many persons hope to obtain from God’s hands riches, and many perishable and
transitory honours; and, in short, anything else they hope to obtain at God’s hands, except
only God Himself. But do thou seek after thy God Himself: nay, indeed, despising all things
else, make thy way unto Him! Forget other things, remember Him. Leave other things behind,
and “press forward”1111 unto Him. Surely it is He Himself, who set thee right, when turned
away from the right path; who, now that thou art set in the right path, guides thee aright,
who guides thee to thy destination. Let Him then be thy hope, who both guides thee, and
guides thee to thy destination. Whither does worldly covetousness lead thee? And to what
point does it conduct thee at the last? Thou didst at first desire a farm; then thou wouldest
possess an estate; thou wouldest shut out thy neighbours; having shut them out, thou didst
set thy heart on the possessions of other neighbours; and didst extend thy covetous desires
till thou hadst reached the shore: arriving at the shore, thou covetest the islands: having
made the earth thine own, thou wouldest haply seize upon heaven. Leave thou all thy loves.
He who made heaven and earth is more beautiful than all.

Psalm XL
8. “Blessed is the man that maketh the name of the Lord his hope, and who hath not
regarded vanities and lying madnesses.” For whence is it that “madness” is called “lying”?
Insanity is a lying thing, even as it is sanity that sees the Truth. For what thou seest as good
things,1112 thou art deceived; thou art not in thy sound senses: a violent fever has driven
thee to frenzy: that which thou art in love with is not a reality. Thou applaudest the charioteer;
thou cheerest the charioteer; thou art madly in love with the charioteer. It is “vanity;” it is
“a lying madness.” “It is ‘not’” (he cries). “Nothing can be better; nothing more delightful.”
What can I do for one in a state of high fever? Pray ye for such persons, if you have any
feelings of compassion in you. For the physician himself also in a desperate case generally
turns to those in the house, who stand around weeping; who are hanging on his lips to hear
his opinion of the patient who is sick and in danger. The physician stands in a state of doubt:
he sees not any good to promise; he fears to pronounce evil, lest he should excite alarm. He
devises a thoroughly modest sentence: “The good God can do all things. Pray ye for him.”
Which then of these madmen shall I check? Which of them will listen to me? Which of them
would not call us miserable? Because they suppose us to have lost great and various pleasures,
of which they are madly fond, in that we are not as madly in love with them as they are: and
they do not see that they are “lying” pleasures.…“And hath not respected vanities, and lying
madnesses.” “Such a one has won,” he cries; “he harnessed such and such a horse,” he pro-
claims aloud. He would fain be a kind of diviner; he aspires to the honours of divination by
abandoning the fountain of Divinity; and he frequently pronounces an opinion, and is fre-
quently mistaken. Why is this? Even because they are “lying madnesses.” But why is it that
what they say sometimes comes true? That they may lead astray the foolish ones; that by
loving the semblance of truth there, they may fall into the snare of falsehood: let them be
left behind, let them be “given over,” let them be “cut off.” If they were members of us, they
must be mortified. “Mortify,” he says, “your members which are upon the earth.”1113 Let
our God be our hope. He who made all things, is better than all! He who made what is
beautiful, is more beautiful than all that is such. He who made whatever is mighty, is Himself
mightier. He who made whatever is great, is Himself greater. He will be unto you everything
that you love. Learn in the creature to love the Creator; and in the work Him who made it.
Let not that which has been made by Him detain thine affections, so that thou shouldest
lose Him by whom thou thyself wert made also. “Blessed,” then, “is the man that maketh
the Name of the Lord his trust, and hath not respected vanities and lying madnesses.”…
9. We will give him other sights in exchange for such sights as these. And what sights
shall we present to the Christian, whom we would fain divert from those sights? I thank the
Lord our God; He in the following verse of the Psalm hath shown us what sights we ought
1112 mss. want putas; with it, the sense is, “What you see, you think to be good things.”
1113 Col. iii. 5.
Psalm XL
to present and offer to spectators who would fain have sights to see? Let us now suppose
him to be weaned from the circus, the theatre, the amphitheatre; let him be looking after,
let him by all means be looking after, some sight to see; we do not leave him without a
spectacle. What then shall we give in exchange for those? Hear what follows.
“Many, O Lord my God, are the wonderful works which Thou hast made” (ver. 5). He
used to gaze at the “wonderful works” of man; let him now contemplate the wonderful works
of God. “Many are the wonderful works” that God “has made.” Why are they become vile
in his eyes? He praises the charioteer guiding four horses; running all of them without fault
and without stumbling. Perhaps the Lord has not made such “wonderful works” in things
spiritual. Let him control lust,1114 let him control cowardice,1115 let him control injustice,
let him control imprudence, I mean, the passions which falling into excess produce those
vices; let him control these and bring them into subjection, and let him hold the reins, and
not suffer himself to be carried away; let him guide them the way he himself would have
them go; let him not be forced away whither he would not. He used to applaud the charioteer,
he himself shall be applauded for his own charioteering; he used to call out that the charioteer
should be invested with a dress of honour; he shall himself be clothed with immortality.
These are the spectacles, these the sights that God exhibits to us. He cries out of heaven,
“My eyes are upon you. Strive, and ‘I will’ assist you; triumph, and I will crown you.”
“And in Thy thought there is none that is like unto Thee.” Now then look at the actor!
For the man hath by dint of great pains learnt to walk upon a rope; and hanging there he
holds thee hanging in suspense. Turn to Him who exhibits spectacles far more wonderful.
This man hath learned to walk upon the rope; but hath he caused another to walk on the
sea? Forget now thy theatre; behold our Peter; not a walker on the rope, but, so to speak, a
walker on the sea. 1116 And do thou also walk on other waters (though not on those on
which Peter walked, to symbolize a certain truth), for this world is a sea. It hath a deleterious
bitterness; it hath the waves of tribulations, the tempests of temptations; it hath men in it
who, like fish, delight in their own ruin, and prey upon each other; walk thou here, set thou
thy foot on this. Thou wouldest see sights; be thyself a “spectacle.” That thy spirit may not
sink, look on Him who goes before thee, and says, “We have been made a spectacle unto
this world, and unto angels, and unto men.”1117 Tread thou on the waters; suffer not thyself
to be drowned in the sea. Thou wilt not go there, thou wilt not “tread it under foot,” unless
it be His bidding, who was Himself the first to walk upon the sea. For it was thus that Peter
spoke. “If Thou art, bid me come unto Thee on the waters.”1118 And because “He was,” He

heard him when praying; He granted his wish to him when expressing his desire; He raised
him up when sinking. These are the “wonderful works” that the “Lord hath made.” Look
on them; let faith be the eye of him who would behold them. And do thou also likewise; for
although the winds alarm thee, though the waves rage against thee, and though human
frailty may have inspired thee with some doubt of thy salvation, thou hast it in thy power
to “cry out,” thou mayest say “Lord, I perish.”1119 He who bids thee walk there, suffers thee
not to perish. For in that thou now walkest “on the Rock,” thou fearest not even on the sea!
If thou art without “the Rock,” thou must sink in the sea; for the Rock on which thou must
walk is such an one as is not sunk in the sea,
10. Observe then the “wonderful works” of God. “I have declared, and have spoken;
they are multiplied beyond number.” There is “a number,” there are some over and above
the number. There is a fixed number that belongs to that heavenly Jerusalem. For “the Lord
knoweth them that are His;”1120 the Christians that fear Him, the Christians that believe,
the Christians that keep the commandments, that walk in God’s ways, that keep themselves
from sins; that if they fall confess: they belong to “the number.” But are they the only ones?
There are also some “beyond the number.” For even if they be but a few (a few in comparison
of the numbers of the larger majority), with how great numbers are our Churches filled,
crowded up to the very walls; to what a degree do they annoy each other by the pressure,
and almost choke each other by their overflowing numbers. Again, out of these very same
persons, when there is a public spectacle,1121 there are numbers flocking to the amphitheatre;
these are over and above “the number.” But it is for this reason that we say this, that they
may be in “the number.” Not being present, they do not hear this from us; but when ye have
gone from hence, let them hear it from you. “I have declared,” he says, “and have spoken.”
It is Christ who speaks. “He hath declared it,” in His own Person, as our Head. He hath
Himself declared it by His members. He Himself hath sent those who should “declare” it;
He Himself hath sent the Apostles. “Their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words
unto the ends of the world.”1122 How great the number of believers that are gathered together;
how great the multitudes that flock together; many of them truly converted, many but in
appearance: and those who are truly converted are the minority; those who are so but in
appearance are the majority: because “they are multiplied beyond the number.”
11. …These are the “wonderful works” of God; these are the “thoughts” of God, to which
“no man’s thoughts are like;” that the lover of sight-seeing may be weaned from curiosity:1123

and with us may seek after those more excellent, those more profitable things, in which,
when he shall have attained unto them, he will rejoice.…
12. “Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire” (ver. 6), saith the Psalm to God. For
the men of old time, when as yet the true Sacrifice, which is known to the faithful, was
foreshown in figures, used to celebrate rites that were figures of the reality that was to be
hereafter; many of them understanding their meaning; but more of them in ignorance of
it. For the Prophets and the holy Patriarchs understood what they were celebrating; but the
rest of the “stiff-necked people” were so carnal, that what was done by them was but to
symbolize the things that were to come afterwards; and it came to pass,1124 when that first
sacrifice was abolished; when the burnt-offerings of “rams, of goats, and of calves,” and of
other victims, had been abolished, “God did not desire them.” Why did God not desire
them? And why did He at the first desire them? Because all those things were, as it were,
the words of a person making a promise; and the expressions conveying a promise, when
the thing that they promise is come, are no longer uttered.…Those sacrifices then, as being
but expressions of a promise, have been abrogated. What is that which has been given as its
fulfilment? That “Body;” which ye know; which ye do not all of you know; which, of you
who do know it, I pray God all may not know it unto condemnation. Observe the time when
it was said; for the person is Christ our Lord, speaking at one time for His members, at an-
other in His own person. “Sacrifice and offering,” said He, “Thou didst not desire.” What
then? Are we left at this present time without a sacrifice? God forbid!
“But a Body hast Thou perfected for me.”1125 It was for this reason that Thou didst not
desire the others; that Thou mightest “perfect” this; before Thou “perfectedst” this, Thou
didst desire the others. The fulfilment of the promise has done away with the words that
express the promise. For if they still hold out a promise, that which was promised is not yet
fulfilled. This was promised by certain signs; the signs that convey the promise are done
away; because the Substance that was promised is come. We are in this “Body.” We are
partakers of this “Body.” We know that which we ourselves receive; and ye who know it not
yet, will know it bye and bye; and when ye come to know it, I pray ye may not receive it
unto condemnation.1126 “For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation unto himself.”1127 “A Body” hath been “perfected” for us; let us be made perfect
in the Body.
13. “Burnt-offerings also for sin hast Thou not required.” “Then said I, Lo, I come!”
(ver. 7). It is time that what “was promised should come;” because the signs, by means of

which they were promised, have been put away. And indeed, Brethren, observe these put
away; those fulfilled. Let the Jewish nation at this time show me their priest, if they can!
Where are their sacrifices? They are brought to an end; 1128 they are put away now. Should
we at that time have rejected them?1129 We do reject them now; because, if you chose to
celebrate them now, it were unseasonable;1130 unfitting at the time; incongruous. You are
still making promises; I have already received! There has remained to them a certain thing
for them to celebrate; that they might not remain altogether without a sign.…In such a case
then are they; like Cain with his mark. The sacrifices, however, which used to be performed
there, have been put away; and that which remained unto them for a sign like that of Cain,
hath by this time been fulfilled; and they know it not. They slay the Lamb; they eat the un-
leavened bread. “Christ has been sacrificed for us, as our Passover.”1131 Lo, in the sacrifice
of Christ, I recognise the Lamb that was slain! What of the unleavened bread? “Therefore,”
says he, “let us keep the feast; not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of wickedness”
(he shows what is meant by “old;” it is “stale” flour; it is sour), “but in the unleavened bread
of sincerity and truth.”1132 They have continued in the shade; they cannot abide the Sun of
Glory. We are already in the light of day. We have “the Body” of Christ, we have the Blood
of Christ. If we have a new life, let us “sing a new song, even a hymn unto our God.”1133
“Burnt offerings for sin Thou didst not desire. Then said I, Lo, I come!”
14. “In the head1134 of the Book it is written of me, that I should fulfil Thy will: O my
God, I am willing, and Thy Law is within my heart” (ver. 8). Behold! He turns His regards
to His members. Behold! He hath Himself “fulfilled the will” of the Father. But in what
“beginning1135 of a Book” is it written of Him? Perhaps in the beginning of this Book of
Psalms. For why should we seek far for it, or examine into other books for it? Behold! It is
written in the beginning of this Book of Psalms! “His will is in the Law of the Lord;”1136
that is, “‘O my God, I am willing,’ and ‘Thy Law is within my heart;’” that is the same as,
“And in His Law doth he meditate day and night.”
15. “I have well declared Thy righteousness in the great congregation” (ver. 9). He now
addresses His members. He is exhorting them to do what He has already done. He has “de-

clared;” let us declare also. He has suffered; let us “suffer with Him.” He has been glorified;
we shall be “glorified with Him.”1137 “I have declared Thy righteousness in the great con-
gregation.” How great an one is that? In all the world. How great is it? Even among all nations.
Why among all nations? Because He is “the Seed of Abraham, in whom all nations shall be
blessed.”1138 Why among all nations? “Because their sound hath gone forth into all lands.”1139
“Lo! I will not refrain my lips, O Lord, and that Thou knowest.” My lips speak; I will not
“refrain” them from speaking. My lips indeed sound audibly in the ears of men; but “Thou
knowest” mine heart. “I will not refrain my lips, O Lord; that Thou knowest.” It is one thing
that man heareth; another that God “knoweth.” That the “declaring” of it should not be
confined to the lips alone, and that it might not be said of us, “Whatsoever things they say
unto you, do; but do not after their works;”1140 or lest it should be said to the people,
“praising God with their lips, but not with their heart,” “This people honoureth Me with
their lips, but their heart is far from Me;”1141 do thou make audible confession with thy lips;
draw nigh with thine heart also.1142 “For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”1143 In case like unto which that
thief was found, who, hanging on the Cross with the Lord, did on the Cross acknowledge
the Lord. Others had refused to acknowledge Him while working miracles; this man acknow-
ledged Him when hanging on the Cross. That thief had every other member pierced through;
his hands were fastened by the nails; his feet were pierced also; his whole body was fastened
to the tree; the body was not disengaged in its other members; the heart and the tongue were
disengaged;1144 “with the heart” he “believed; with the tongue” he made “confession.” “Re-
member me, O Lord,” he said, “when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.” He hoped for the
coming of his salvation at a time far remote; he was content to receive it after a long delay;
his hope rested on an object far remote. The day, however, was not postponed! The answer
was, “This day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.”1145 Paradise hath happy trees! This day

16. “I have not hid my1146 righteousness within my heart” (ver. 10). What is meant by
“my righteousness”? My faith. For, “the just shall live by faith.”1147 As suppose the persecutor
under threat of punishment, as they were once allowed to do, puts you to the question,
“What art thou? Pagan or Christian?” “A Christian.” That is his “righteousness.” He believeth;
he “lives by faith.” He doth not “hide his righteousness within his heart.” He has not said
in his heart, “I do indeed believe in Christ; but I will not tell what I believe to this persecutor,
who is raging against me, and threatening me. My God knoweth that inwardly, within my
heart, I do believe. He knoweth that I renounce Him not.” Lo! you say that you have this
inwardly within your heart! What have you upon your lips? “I am not a Christian.” Your
lips bear witness against your heart. “I have not hid my righteousness within my heart.”…
17. “I have declared Thy Truth and Thy Salvation.” I have declared Thy Christ. This is
the meaning of, “I have declared Thy Truth and Thy Salvation.” How is “Thy Truth” Christ?
“I am the Truth.”1148 How is Christ “His Salvation”? Simeon recognised the infant in His
Mother’s hands in the Temple, and said, “For mine eyes have seen Thy Salvation.”1149 The
old man recognised the little child; the old man having himself “become a little child”1150
in that infant, having been renewed by faith. For he had received an oracle from God; and
it said this, “The Lord had said unto him, that he was not to depart out of this life, until he
had seen the “Salvation of God.” This “Salvation of God” it is a good thing to have shown
unto men; but let them cry, “Show us Thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us Thy Salvation.”…
18. “I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy Truth from the great congregation.” Let
us be there; let us also be numbered among the members of this Body: let us not keep back
“the mercy” of the Lord, and “the Truth” of the Lord. Wouldest thou hear what “the mercy
of the Lord” is? Depart from thy sins; He will forgive thy sins. Wouldest thou hear what
“the truth” of the Lord is? Hold fast righteousness. Thy righteousness shall receive a crown.
For mercy is announced to you now; “Truth” is to be shown unto thee hereafter. For God
is not merciful in such a way as not to be just, nor just in such a way as not to be merciful.
Does that mercy seem to thee an inconsiderable one? He will not impute unto thee all thy
former sins: thou hast lived ill up to this present day; thou art still living; this day live well;
then thou wilt not “conceal” this “mercy.” If this is meant by “mercy,” what is meant by
“truth”?…

Psalm XL
19. “Remove not Thou Thy mercies far from me, O Lord” (ver. 11). He is turning his
attention to the wounded members. Because I have not “concealed Thy mercy and Thy
Truth from the great congregation,” from the Unity of the Universal Church, look Thou
on Thy afflicted members, look on those who are guilty of sins of omission, and on those
who are guilty of sins of commission: and withhold not Thou Thy mercies. “Thy mercy and
Thy Truth have continually preserved me.” I should not dare to turn from my evil way, were
I not assured of remission; I could not endure so as to persevere, if I were not assured of the
fulfilment of Thy promise.…
“Innumerable evils have compassed me about” (ver. 12). Who can number sins? Who
can count his own sins, and those of others? A burden under which he was groaning, who
said, “Cleanse Thou me from my secret faults; and from the faults of others, spare Thou
Thy servant, O Lord.”1151 Our own are too little; those “of others” are added to the burden.
I fear for myself; I fear for a virtuous brother, I have to bear with a wicked brother; and under
such burthen what shall we be, if God’s mercy were to fail? “But Thou, Lord, remove not
afar off.” Be Thou near unto us! To whom is the Lord near? “Even” unto them that “are of
a broken heart.”1152 He is far from the proud: He is near to the humble. “For though the
Lord is high, yet hath He respect unto the lowly.”1153 But let not those that are proud think
themselves to be unobserved: for the things that are high, He “beholdeth afar off.” He “beheld
afar off” the Pharisee, who boasted himself; He was near at hand to succour the Publican,
who made confession.1154 The one extolled his own merits, and concealed his wounds; the
other boasted not of his merits, but laid bare his wounds. He came to the Physician; he knew
that he was sick, and that he required to be made whole; he “dared not lift up his eyes to
Heaven: he smote upon his breast.” He spared not himself, that God might spare him; he
acknowledged himself guilty, that God might “ignore” the charge against him. He punished
himself, that God might free him from punishment.…
20. “Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I could not see.” There is a
something for us “to see;” what prevents us so that we see it not? Is it not iniquity? From
beholding this light1155 your eye is prevented perhaps by some humour penetrating into it;
perhaps by smoke, or dust, or by something else that has been thrown into it: and you have
not been able to raise your wounded eye to contemplate this light of day. What then? Will
you be able to lift up your wounded heart unto God? Must it not be first healed, in order
that thou mayest see? Do you not show your pride, when you say, “First let me see, and then

Psalm XL
I will believe”? Who is there who says this? For who that would fain see, says, “Let me see,
and then I will believe”? I am about to manifest the Light unto thee; or rather the Light Itself
would fain manifest Itself to thee! To whom? It cannot manifest Itself to the blind. He does
not see. Whence is it that he seeth not? It is that the eye is clogged by the multitude of sins.…
21. “They are more than the hairs of my head.” He subjects the number of the “hairs of
his head” to calculation. Who is there can calculate the number of the hairs of his head?
Much less can he tell the number of his sins, which exceed the number of the hairs of his
head. They seem to be minute; but they are many in number. You have guarded against
great ones; you do not now commit adultery, or murder; you do not plunder the property
of others; you do not blaspheme; and do not bear false witness; those are the weightier kind
of sins. You have guarded against great sins, what are you doing about your smaller ones?
You have cast off the weight; beware lest the sand overwhelm you. “And my heart hath
forsaken me.” What wonder if thine heart is forsaken by thy God, when it is even “forsaken”
by itself? What is meant by “faileth me,” “forsaketh me”? Is not capable of knowing itself.
He means this: “My heart hath forsaken me.” I would fain see God with mine heart, and
cannot from the multitude of my sins: that is not enough; mine heart does not even know
itself. For no one thoroughly knows himself: let no one presume upon his own state. Was
Peter able to comprehend with his own heart the state of his own heart, who said, “I will be
with Thee even unto death”?1156 There was a false presumption in the heart; there was
lurking in that heart at the same time a real fear: and the heart was not able to comprehend
the state of the heart. Its state was unknown to the sick heart itself: it was manifest to the
physician. That which was foretold of him was fulfilled. God knew that in him which he
knew not in himself: because his heart had forsaken him, his heart was unknown to his
heart.
22. “Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me” (ver. 13). As if he were saying, “‘If Thou wilt,
Thou canst make me clean.’1157 Be pleased to deliver me. O Lord, look upon me to help
me.” Look,1158 that is, on the penitent members, members that lie in pain, members that
are writhing under the instruments of the surgeon; but still in hope.
23. “Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy
it” (ver. 14). For in a certain passage he makes an accusation, and says, “I looked upon my
right hand, and beheld; and there was no man who sought after my soul;”1159 that is, there
was no man to imitate Mine example. Christ in His Passion is the Speaker. “I looked on my
right hand,” that is, not on the ungodly Jews, but on Mine own right hand, the
1156 Luke xxii. 33.
1157 Matt. viii. 2.

1159 Ps. cxlii. 4.
Psalm XL
Apostles,—“and there was no man who sought after My soul.” So thoroughly was there no
man to “seek after My soul,” that he who had presumed on his own strength, “denied My
soul.” But because a man’s soul is sought after in two ways, either in order that you may
enjoy his society; or that you may persecute him; therefore he here speaks of others, whom
he would have “confounded and ashamed,” who are “seeking after his soul.” But lest you
should understand it in the same way as when he complains of some who did not “seek after
his soul,” He adds, “to destroy it;” that is, they seek after my soul in order to my death.…
24. “Let them be turned backward1160 and put to shame that wish me evil.” “Turned
backwards.” Let us not take this in a bad sense. He wishes them well; and it is His voice,
who said from the Cross, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”1161
Wherefore then doth he say to them, that they should return “backwards”? Because they
who before were proud, so that they fell, are now become humble, so that they may rise
again. For when they are before, they are wishing to take precedence of their Lord; to be
better than He; but if they go behind Him, they acknowledge Him to be better than they;
they acknowledge that He ought to go before; that He should precede,1162 they follow.
Thence He thus rebukes Peter giving Him evil counsel. For the Lord, when about to suffer
for our salvation, also foretold what was to happen concerning that Passion itself; and Peter
says, “Be it far from Thee,”1163 “God forbid it!” “This shall not be!” He would fain have gone
before his Lord; would have given counsel to his Master! But the Lord, that He might make
him not go before Him, but follow after Him, says, “Get thee behind, Satan!” It is for this
reason He said “Satan,” because thou art seeking to go before Him, whom thou oughtest to
follow; but if thou art behind, if thou follow Him, thou wilt henceforth not be “Satan.” What
then? “Upon this Rock I will build My Church.” 1164…
25. “Let them speedily bear away their own confusion, that say unto me, Well done!
Well done!”1165 (ver. 15). They praise you without reason. “A great man! A good man! A
man of education and of learning; but why a Christian?” They praise those things in you
which you should wish not to be praised; they find fault with that at which you rejoice. But
if perhaps you say, “What is it you praise in me, O man? That I am a virtuous man? A just
man? If you think this, Christ made me this; praise Him.” But the other says, “Be it far from
you. Do yourself no wrong! You yourself made yourself such.” “Let them be confounded
who say unto me, Well done! Well done!” And what follows?

“Let all those that seek Thee, O Lord, rejoice and be glad” (ver. 16). Those who “seek”
not me, but “Thee;” who say not to me, “Well done! Well done!” but see me “glory in Thee,”
if I have anything whereof to glory; for “he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.”1166 “Let
all those who seek Thee, Lord, rejoice and be glad.”
“And say continually, the Lord be magnified.” For even if the sinner becometh righteous,
thou shouldest give the glory to “Him who justifieth the ungodly.”1167 Whether therefore
it be a sinner, let Him be praised who calls him to forgiveness; or one already walking in the
way of righteousness, let Him be praised who calls him to receive the crown! Let the Name
of the Lord be magnified continually by “such as love Thy salvation.”
“But I” (ver. 17). I for whom they were seeking evil, I whose “life they were seeking, that
they might take it away.” But turn thee to another description of persons. But I to whom
they said, “Well done! Well done!” “I am poor and needy.” There is nothing in me that may
be praised as mine own. Let Him rend my sackcloth in sunder, and cover me with His robe.
For, “Now I live, not I myself; but Christ liveth in me.” 1168 If it is Christ that “liveth in thee,”
and all that thou hast is Christ’s, and all that thou art to have hereafter is Christ’s also; what
art thou in thyself? “I am poor and needy.” Now I am not rich, because I am not proud. He
was rich who said, “Lord, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are;”1169 but the publican
was poor, who said, “Lord, be merciful to me a sinner!” The one was belching from his fulness;
the other from want was crying piteously, “I am poor and needy!” And what wouldest thou
do, O poor and needy man? Beg at God’s door; “Knock, and it shall be opened unto
thee.”1170—“As for me, I am poor and needy. Yet the Lord careth for me.”—“Cast thy care
upon the Lord, and He shall bring it to pass.”1171 What canst thou effect for thyself by taking
care what canst thou provide for thyself? Let Him who made thee “care for thee.” He who
cared for thee before thou wert, how shall He fail to have a care of thee, now that thou art
what He would have thee be? For now thou art a believer, now thou art walking in the “way
of righteousness.” Shall not He have a care for thee, who “maketh His sun rise on the good
and on the evil, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust”? 1172…
“Thou art my Help, and my Deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God” (ver. 17). He is
calling upon God, imploring Him, fearing lest he should fall away: “Make no tarrying.”
What is meant by “make no tarrying”? We lately read concerning the days of tribulation:

1172 Matt. v. 45.
Psalm XL
“Unless those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.”1173 The members
of Christ—the Body of Christ extended everywhere—are asking of God, as one single person,
one single poor man, and beggar! For He too was poor, who “though He was rich, yet became
poor, that ye through His poverty might be made rich.”1174 It is He that maketh rich those
who are the true poor;1175 and maketh poor those who are falsely rich. He crieth unto Him;
“From the end of the earth I cried unto Thee, when my heart was in heaviness.” There will
come days of tribulations, and of greater tribulations; they will come even as the Scripture
speaks: and as days advance, so are tribulations increased also. Let no one promise himself
what the Gospel doth not promise.…

Psalm XL
Psalm XLI.1176
To the people, on the Feast of the Martyrs.
1. The solemn day of the Martyrs hath dawned; therefore to the glory of the Passion of
Christ, the Captain of Martyrs, who spared not Himself, ordering His soldiers to the fight;
but first fought, first conquered, that their fighting He might encourage by His example,
and aid with His majesty, and crown with His promise: let us hear somewhat from this
Psalm pertaining to His Passion. I commend unto you oftentimes, nor grieve I to repeat,
what for you is useful to retain, that our Lord Jesus Christ speaketh often of Himself, that
is, in His own Person, which is our Head; often in the person of His Body, which are we and
His Church; but so that the words sound as from the mouth of one, that we may understand
the Head and the Body to consist together in the unity of integrity, and not be separated the
one from the other; as in that marriage whereof it is said, “They two shall be one flesh.”1177
If then we acknowledge two in one flesh, let us acknowledge two in one voice. First, that
which responding to the reader1178 we have sung, though it be from the middle of the Psalm,
from that I will take the beginning of this Sermon.
“Mine enemies speak evil of Me, When He shall die, then shall His Name perish” (ver.
5). This is the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ: but see if herein are not understood the
members also. This was spoken also when our Lord Himself walked in the flesh here on
earth.…When they saw the people go after Him, they said, “When He shall die, then shall
His Name perish;” that is, when we have slain Him, then shall His Name be no more in the
earth, nor shall He seduce any, being dead; but by that very slaying of Him shall men under-
stand, that He was but a man whom they followed, that there was in Him no hope of salvation,
and shall desert His Name, and it shall no more be. He died, and His Name perished not,
but His Name was sown as seed: He died, but He was a grain, which dying, the corn imme-
diately sprang up.1179 When glorified then was our Lord Jesus Christ, began they much
more, and much more numerously to trust in Him; then began His members to hear what
the Head had heard. Now then our Lord Jesus Christ being in heaven set down, and Himself
in us labouring on earth, still spake His enemies, “When He shall die, then shall His Name
perish.” For hence stirred up the devil persecutions in the Church to destroy the Name of
Christ. Unless haply ye think, brethren, that those Pagans, when they raged against Christians,
said not this among themselves, “to blot out the Name of Christ from the earth.” That Christ
might die again, not in the Head, but in His Body, were slain also the Martyrs. To the mul-

Psalm XLI
Psalm XLI
tiplying of the Church availed the Holy Blood poured forth, to help Its seminating came
also the death of the Martyrs. “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His Saints.”1180
More and more were the Christians multiplied, nor was it fulfilled which spake the enemies,
“When He shall die, then shall His Name perish.” Even now also is it spoken. Down sit the
Pagans, and compute them the years, they hear their fanatics1181 saying, A time shall come
when Christians shall be none, and those idols must be worshipped as before they were
worshipped: still say they, “When He shall die, then shall His Name perish.” Twice conquered,
now the third time be wise! Christ died, His Name has not perished: the Martyrs died,
multiplied more is the Church, groweth through all nations the Name of Christ. He who
foretold of His own Death, and of His Resurrection, He who foretold of His Martyrs’ death,
and of their crown, He Himself foretold of His Church things yet to come, if truth He spake
twice, has He the third time lied? Vain then is what ye believe against Him; better is it that
ye believe in Him, that ye may “understand upon the needy and poor One;”1182 that “though
He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be
rich.”1183…
2. “Blessed is he that understandeth upon the needy and poor One: in the evil day shall
the Lord deliver him” (ver. 1). For the evil day will come: will thou, nill thou, come it will:
the Day of Judgment will come upon thee, an evil day if thou “understand not the needy
and poor.” For what now thou wilt not believe, shall be made manifest in the end. But neither
shalt thou escape, when it shall be made manifest, because thou believest not, when it is kept
secret. Invited art thou, what thou seest not to believe, lest when thou see, thou be put to
the blush. “Understand then upon the needy and poor One,” that is, Christ: understand in
Him the hidden riches, whom poor thou seest. “In Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge.”1184 For thereby in the evil day shall He deliver thee, in that He is God: but
in that He is man, and that which in Him is human hath raised to life, and changed for the
1180 Ps. cxvi. 15.
1181 In the City of God, b. xviii. c. 53, 54, he mentions that the heathens had some Greek verses, in the form
of an oracle, to the effect that the magical arts of Peter had prevailed to procure divine worship to Christ for 365
years, after which it was to terminate. This period, he says, if computed from the first Pentecost after the Resur-
rection, would expire in the consulship of Honorius and Eutychianus, A.D. 398. The next year, which ought to
have seen paganism re-established, was marked by the demolition of idols by imperial authority.—Ben. [See

Psalm XLI
better, He hath lifted (thee1185) to heaven. But He who is God, who would have one person
in man and with man, could neither decrease nor increase, neither die nor rise again. He
died out of man’s infirmity, but God dieth not.…But as we rightly say, Such a man died,
though his soul dieth not; so we rightly say, Christ died, though His Divinity dieth not.
Wherefore died? Because needy and poor. Let not His death offend thee, and avert thee
from beholding His Divinity. “Blessed is he that understandeth upon the needy and poor
One.” Consider also the poor, the needy, the hungry and thirsty, the naked, the sick, the
prisoners; understand also upon such poor, for if upon such thou understand, thou under-
standest upon Him who said, “I was an hungred, I was thirsty, I was a stranger, naked, sick,
in prison;”1186 so in the evil day shall the Lord deliver thee.…
3. “And deliver him not into the hand of his enemy” (ver. 2). The enemy is the devil.
Let none think of a man his enemy, when he hears these words. Haply one thought of his
neighbour, of him who had a suit with him in court, of him who would take from him his
own possession, of him who would force him to sell to him his house. Think not this; but
that enemy think of, of whom said the Lord, “an enemy hath done this.”1187 For He it is
who suggests that for things earthly he be worshipped, for overthrow the Christian Name
this enemy cannot. For he hath seen himself conquered by the fame and praises of Christ,
he hath seen, whereas he slew Christ’s Martyrs, that they are crowned, he triumphed over.
He hath begun to be unable to persuade men that Christ is nought; and because by reviling
Christ, he now with difficulty deceives, by lauding Christ, he endeavours to deceive. Before
this what said he? Whom worship ye? A Jew, dead, crucified, a man of no moment, who
could not even from himself drive away death. When after His Name he saw running the
whole human race, saw that in the Name of the Crucified temples are thrown down, idols
are broken, sacrifices abolished; and that all these things predicted in the Prophets are con-
sidered by men, by men with wonder astonished, and closing now their hearts against the
reviling of Christ; he clothes himself with praise of Christ, and begins to deter from the faith
in another manner. Great is the law of Christ, powerful is that law, divine, ineffable! but
who fulfilleth it? In the name of our Saviour,1188 “tread upon the lion and the dragon.”1189
By reviling openly roared the lion; by lauding craftily lurks the dragon. Let them come to
the faith, who doubted; and not say, Who fulfilleth it? If on their own strength they presume,
1185 Or “It,” reading as Ben. Oxf. mss. have “not in that He is Man; and that which in Him was human, in
thee He will raise again, and change to better, and lift to heaven.” The future, “shall lift,” is probably right. Ed.
Ben. gives no various readings here; our mss. vary somewhat.

they will not fulfil it. Presuming on the grace of God let them believe, presuming (on it) let
them come; to be aided come, not to be judged. So live all the faithful in the Name of Christ,
each one in his degree fulfilling the commands of Christ, whether married, or celibates and
virgins, they live as much as God granteth them to live; neither presume they in their own
strength, but know that in Him they ought to glory.…
4. “The Lord help him” (ver. 3). But when? Haply in heaven, haply in the life eternal,
that so it remain to worship the devil for earthly needs, for the necessities of this life. Far be
it! Thou hast “promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.”1190 He came
unto thee on earth, by Whom were made heaven and earth. Consider then what He saith,
“The Lord help him, on his bed of pain.” The bed of pain is the infirmity of the flesh; lest
thou shouldest say, I cannot hold, and carry, and tie up my flesh; thou art aided that thou
mayest. The Lord help thee on thy bed of pain. Thy bed did carry thee, thou carriedst not
thy bed, but wast a paralytic inwardly; He cometh who saith to thee, “Take up thy bed, and
go thy way into thy house.”1191 “The Lord help him on his bed of pain.” Then to the Lord
Himself He turneth, as though it were asked,1192 Why then, since the Lord helpeth us, suffer
we such great ills in this life, such great scandals, such great labours, such disquiet from the
flesh and the world? He turneth to God, and as though explaining to us the counsel of His
healing, He saith, “Thou hast turned all his bed in his infirmity.” By the bed is understood
anything earthly. Every soul that is infirm in this life seeketh for itself somewhat whereon
to rest, because intensity of labour, and of the soul extended toward God, it can hardly endure
perpetually, somewhat it seeketh on earth whereon to rest, and in a manner with a kind of
pausing to recline, as are those things which innocent ones love.…The innocent man resteth
in his house, his family, his wife, his children; in his poverty, his little farm, his orchard
planted with his own hand, in some building fabricated with his own study; in these rest
the innocent. But yet God willing us not to have love but of life eternal, even with these,
though innocent delights, mixeth bitterness, that even in these we may suffer tribulation,
and so He turneth all our bed in our infirmity. “Thou hast turned all his bed in his infirmity.”
Let him not then complain, when in these things which he hath innocently, he suffereth
some tribulations. He is taught to love the better, by the bitterness of the worse; lest going
a traveller to his country, he choose the inn instead of his own home.
5. But why this? Because He “scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”1193 Why this?
Because to men sinning was it said, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.”1194

1193 Heb. xii. 6.
1194 Gen. iii. 19.
Psalm XLI
Therefore because all these chastisements, in which all our bed is turned in our infirmity,
man ought to acknowledge that he suffers for sin; let him turn himself, and say what follows:
“I said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee” (ver. 4). O
Lord, by tribulations do Thou exercise me; to be scourged Thou judgest every son whom
Thou wilt receive, who sparedst not even the Only-Begotten. He indeed without sin was
scourged; but I say, “I have sinned against Thee.”…
6. “Mine enemies speak evil of Me, When He shall die, then shall His Name perish”
(ver. 5). Of this we have already spoken,1195 and from this began.
7. “And entered in1196 to see” (ver. 6). What Christ suffered, that suffereth also the
Church; what the Head suffered, that suffer also the Members. “For the disciple is not above
his Master, nor the servant above his Lord.”1197…
If to Christ’s Members thou belongest, come within, cling to the Head. Endure the tares
if thou art wheat, endure the chaff if thou art grain.1198 Endure the bad fish within the net
if thou art a good fish. Wherefore before the time of winnowing dost thou fly away?
Wherefore before the time of harvest, dost thou root up the corn also with thyself? Wherefore
before thou art come to the shore, hast thou broken the nets? “They go abroad, and tell it.”
8. “All mine enemies whisper against Me unto the same thing” (ver. 7). Against Me all
unto the same thing. How much better with me unto the same thing, than against me1199
“unto the same thing.” What is, “Against me unto the same thing”? With one counsel, with
one conspiring. Christ then speaketh unto thee, Ye consent against Me, consent ye to Me:
why against Me? wherefore not with Me? That same thing if ye had always had, ye had not
divided you into schisms. For, saith the Apostle, “I beseech you, brethren, that ye all speak
the same thing, and that there be no division among you.”1200 “All mine enemies whisper
against Me unto the same thing:” against Me do they “devise evil to Me.” To themselves
rather, for “they have gathered iniquity to themselves;” but therefore to Me, because by their
intention they are to be weighed: for not because to do nothing was in their power, to do
nothing was in their will. For the devil lusted to extinguish Christ, and Judas would slay
Christ; yet Christ slain and rising again, we are made alive, but to the devil and to Judas is
rendered the reward of their evil will, not of our salvation.…The intention wherewith they
spake, not what they spake, did He consider, who related that they spake evil of Him, “Against

Me they devised evil to Me.” And what evil to Christ, to the Martyrs what evil? All hath God
turned to good.
9. “An ungodly word do they set forth against Me” (ver. 8). What sort of ungodly word?
Listen to the Head Itself. “Come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance shall be ours.”1201
Fools! How shall the inheritance be yours? Because ye killed Him? Lo! ye even killed Him;
yet shall not the inheritance be yours. “Shall not He that sleepeth add this also, that He rise
again”? When ye exulted that ye had slain Him, He slept; for He saith in another Psalm, “I
slept.” They raged and would slay Me; “I slept.” If I had not willed, I had not even slept. “I
slept,” because “I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again.” 1202
“I laid Me down and slept, and rose up again.”1203 Rage then the Jews; be “the earth given
into the hands of the wicked,”1204 be the flesh left to the hands of persecutors, let them on
wood suspend it, with nails transfix it, with a spear pierce it. “Shall He that sleepeth, not
add this, that He rise up again?” Wherefore slept He? Because “Adam is the figure of Him
that was to come.”1205 And Adam slept, when out of his side was made Eve.1206 Adam in
the figure of Christ, Eve in the figure of the Church; whence she was called “the mother of
all living.”1207 When was Eve created? While Adam slept. When out of Christ’s side flowed
the Sacraments of the Church? While He slept upon the Cross.…
10. “The man of My peace, in whom I trusted, which did eat of My bread, hath enlarged
his heel against Me” (ver. 9): hath raised up his foot against Me: would trample upon Me.
Who is this man of His peace? Judas. And in him did Christ trust, that He said, “in whom
I trusted”? Did He not know him from the beginning? Did He not before he was born know
that he would be? Had He not said to all His disciples, “I have chosen you twelve, and one
of you is a devil”?1208 How then trusted He in him, but that He is in His Members, and that
because many faithful trusted in Judas, the Lord transferred this to Himself?…“The man of
My peace, in whom I trusted, which did eat of My bread.” How showed He him in His
Passion? By the words of His prophecy: by the sop He marked Him out, that it might appear
said of him, “Which did eat of My bread.”1209 Again, when he came to betray Him, He
granted him a kiss,1210 that it might appear said of him, “The man of My peace.”

11. “But Thou, O Lord, be merciful unto Me” (ver. 10). This is the person of a servant,
this is the person of the needy and poor: for,1211 “Blessed is he that understandeth upon the
needy and poor One.” See, as it was spoken, “Be merciful unto Me, and raise Me up, and I
will requite them,” so is it done. For the Jews slew Christ, lest they should lose their place.1212
Christ slain, they lost their place. Rooted out of the kingdom were they, dispersed were they.
He, raised up, requited them tribulation, He requited them unto admonition, not yet unto
condemnation. For the city wherein the people raged, as a ramping and a roaring lion, crying
out, “Crucify Him, Crucify Him,”1213 the Jews rooted out therefrom, hath now Christians,
by not one Jew is inhabited.1214 There is planted the Church of Christ, whence were rooted
out the thorns of the synagogue. For truly this fire blazed “as the fire of thorns.”1215 But the
Lord was as a green tree. This said Himself, when certain women mourned Christ as dy-
ing.…“For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in a dry?” When can a
green tree be consumed by the fire of thorns? For they blazed as fire among thorns. Fire
consumeth thorns, but whatsoever green tree it is applied to, is not easily kindled.…Yet lest
ye think that God the Father of Christ could raise up Christ, that is, the Flesh of His Son,
and that Christ Himself, though He be the Word equal with the Father, could not raise up
His own Flesh; hear out of the Gospel, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.”1216 “But,” said the Evangelist (lest even after this we should doubt), “He spake of the
temple of His Body. Raise Me up, and I will requite them.”
12. “By this I know that Thou favourest Me, that Mine enemies shall not triumph over
Me” (ver. 11.) Because the Jews did triumph, when they saw Christ crucified; they thought
that they had fulfilled their will to do Him hurt: the fruits of their cruelty they saw in effect,
Christ hanging on the Cross: they shook their heads, saying, “If Thou be the Son of God,
come down from the Cross.” 1217 He came not down, who could; His Potency He showed
not, but patience taught. For if, on their saying these things, He had come down from the
Cross, He would have seemed as it were to yield to them insulting, and not being able to
endure reproach, would have been believed conquered: more firm remained He upon the
Cross, than they insulting; fixed was He, they wavering. For therefore shook they their heads,
because to the true Head they adhered not. He taught us plainly patience. For mightier is

that which He did, who would not do what the Jews challenged. For much mightier is it to
rise from the sepulchre, than to come down from the Cross. “That Mine enemies shall not
triumph over Me.” They triumphed then at that time. Christ rose again, Christ was glorified.
Now see they in His Name the human race converted: now let them insult, now shake the
head: rather now let them fix the head, or if they shake the head, in wonder and admiration
let them shake.…
13. “But as for Me, Thou upholdest Me, because of Mine innocence” (ver. 12). Truly
innocence; integrity without sin, requiting without debt, scourging without desert. “Thou
upholdest Me because of Mine innocence, and hast made Me strong in Thy sight for ever.”
Thou hast made Me strong for ever, Thou madest Me weak for a time: Thou hast made Me
strong in Thy sight, Thou madest Me weak in sight of men. What then? Praise to Him, glory
to Him. “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.” For He is the God of Israel, our God, the God
of Jacob, the God of the younger son, the God of the younger people. Let none say, Of the
Jews said He this, I am not Israel; rather the Jews are not Israel. For the elder son, he is the
elder people reprobated; the younger, the people beloved. “The elder shall serve the young-
er:”1218 now is it fulfilled: now, brethren, the Jews serve us, they are as our satchellers,1219
we studying, they carry our books. Hear wherein the Jews serve us, and not without reas-
on.…With them are the Law and the Prophets, in which Law, and in which Prophets, Christ
is preached. When we have to do with Pagans, and show this coming to pass in the Church
of Christ, which before was predicted of the Name of Christ, of the Head and Body of Christ,
lest they think that we have forged these predictions, and from things which have happened,
as though they were future, had made them up, we bring forth the books of the Jews. The
Jews forsooth are our enemies, from an enemy’s books convince we the adversary.1220…If
any enemy clamour and say, “Ye for yourselves have forged prophecies;” be the books of
the Jews brought forth, because the elder shall serve the younger. Therein let them read
those predictions, which now we see fulfilled; and let us all say, “Blessed be the Lord God
of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting, and all the people shall say, So be it, So be it.”

Psalm XLI
Psalm XLII.1221
1. We have undertaken the exposition of a Psalm corresponding to your own “longings,”
on which we propose to speak to you. For the Psalm itself begins with a certain pious
“longing;” and he who sings so, says, “Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks, so longeth
my soul after Thee, O God” (ver. 1). Who is it then that saith this? It is ourselves, if we be
but willing! And why ask, who it is other than thyself, when it is in thy power to be the thing
which thou art asking about? It is not however one individual, but it is “One Body;” but
“Christ’s Body is the Church.”1222 Such “longing” indeed is not found in all who enter the
Church: let all however who have “tasted” the sweetness “of the Lord,”1223 and who own in
Christ that for which they have a relish, think that they are not the only ones; but that there
are such seeds scattered throughout “the field” of the Lord, this whole earth: and that there
is a certain Christian unity, whose voice thus speaks, “Like as the hart desireth the water-
brooks, so longeth my soul after Thee, O God.” And indeed it is not ill understood as the
cry of those, who being as yet Catechumens,1224 are hastening to the grace of the holy Font.
On which account too this Psalm is ordinarily1225 chanted on those occasions, that they
may long for the Fountain of remission of sins, even “as the hart for the water-brooks.” Let
this be allowed; and this meaning retain its place in the Church; a place both truthful and
sanctioned by usage.1226 Nevertheless, it appears to me, my brethren, that such “a longing”
is not fully satisfied even in the faithful in Baptism: but that haply, if they know where they
are sojourning, and whither they have to remove from hence, their “longing” is kindled in
even greater intensity.
2. The title then of it is, “On the end: a Psalm for understanding for the sons of Korah.”
We have met with the sons of Korah in other titles of Psalms:1227 and remember to have
discussed and stated already the meaning of this name. Yet we must even now take notice
of this title in such a way, that what we have said already should be no prejudice against our
saying it again: for all were not present in every place where we said it. Now Korah may
have been, as indeed he was, a certain definite person; and have had sons, who might be
called “the sons of Korah;” let us however search for the secret of which this is the sacrament,
that this name may bring to light the mystery with which it is pregnant. For there is some

1226 Et veracem et solennem.
1227 Later Psalms had been treated before.
Psalm XLII
Psalm XLII
great mystery in the matter that the name “sons of Korah” is given to Christians. Why “sons
of Korah”? They are “sons of the bridegroom, sons of Christ.”1228 Why then does “Korah”
stand for Christ? Because “Korah” is equivalent to “Calvaria.”…Therefore, the “sons of the
bridegroom,” the sons of His Passion, the sons redeemed by His Blood, the sons of His
Cross, who bear on their forehead that which His enemies erected on Calvary, are called
“the sons of Korah;” to them is this Psalm sung as a Psalm for “understanding.” Let then
our understanding be roused: and if the Psalm be sung to us, let us follow it with our “un-
derstanding.”…Run to the brooks; long after the water-brooks. “With God is the fountain
of Life;” a “fountain” that shall never be dried up: in His “Light” is a Light that shall never
be darkened. Long thou for this light: for a certain fountain, a certain light, such as thy
bodily eyes know not; a light to see which the inward eye must be prepared; a fountain, to
drink of which the inward thirst is to be kindled. Run to the fountain; long for the fountain;
but do it not anyhow, be not satisfied with running like any ordinary animal; run thou “like
the hart.” What is meant by “like the hart”? Let there be no sloth in thy running; run with
all thy might: long for the fountain with all thy might. For we find in “the hart” an emblem
of swiftness.
3. But perhaps Scripture meant us to consider in the stag not this point only, but another
also. Hear what else there is in the hart. It destroys serpents,1229 and after the killing of
serpents, it is inflamed with thirst yet more violent; having destroyed serpents, it runs to
“the water-brooks,” with thirst more keen than before. The serpents are thy vices, destroy
the serpents of iniquity; then wilt thou long yet more for “the Fountain of Truth.” Perhaps
avarice whispers in thine ear some dark counsel, hisses against the word of God, hisses
against the commandment of God. And since it is said to thee, “Disregard this or that thing,”
if thou prefer working iniquity to despising some temporal good, thou choosest to be bitten
by a serpent, rather than destroy it. Whilst, therefore, thou art yet indulgent to thy vice, thy
covetousness or thy appetite, when am I to find in thee “a longing” such as this, that might
make thee run to the water-brooks?…
4. There is another point to be observed in the hart. It is reported of stags…that when
they either wander in the herds, or when they are swimming to reach some other parts of
the earth, that they support the burdens of their heads on each other, in such a manner as
that one takes the lead, and others follow, resting their heads upon him, as again others who
follow do upon them, and others in succession to the very end of the herd; but the one who
took the lead in bearing the burden of their heads, when tired, returns to the rear, and rests
himself after his fatigue by supporting his head just as did the others; by thus supporting
what is burdensome, each in turn, they both accomplish their journey, and do not abandon
1228 Matt. ix. 15. Filii sponsi, Lat.
1229 [See p. 67, supra.—C.]
Psalm XLII
each other. Are they not a kind of “harts” that the Apostle addresses, saying, “Bear ye one
another’s burdens, and so fulfil the Law of Christ”?1230…
5. “My soul is athirst for the living God” (ver. 2). What I am saying, that “as the hart
panteth after the water-brooks, so longs my soul after Thee, O God,” means this, “My soul
is athirst for the living God.” For what is it athirst? “When shall I come and appear before
God?” This it is for which I am athirst, to “come and to appear before Him.” I am athirst in
my pilgrimage, in my running; I shall be filled on my arrival. But “When shall I come?” And
this, which is soon in the sight of God, is late to our “longing.”1231 “When shall I come and
appear before God?” This too proceeds from that “longing,” of which in another place comes
that cry, “One thing have I desired of the Lord; that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the
house of the Lord all the days of my life.” Wherefore so? “That I may behold” (he saith) “the
beauty of the Lord.”1232 “When shall I come and appear before the Lord?”…
6. “My tears have been my meat day and night, while they daily say unto me, Where is
thy God?” (ver. 3). My tears (he saith) have been not bitterness, but “my bread.” Those very
tears were sweet unto me: being athirst for that fountain, inasmuch as I was not as yet able
to drink of it, I have eagerly made my tears my meat. For he said not, “My tears became my
drink,” lest he should seem to have longed for them, as for “the water-brooks:” but, still re-
taining that thirst wherewith I burn, and by which I am hurried away towards the water-
brooks, “My tears became my meat,” whilst I am not yet there.1233 And assuredly he does
but the more thirst for the water-brooks from making his tears his meat.…“And they daily
say unto me, Where is thy God?” For if a Pagan should say this to me, I cannot retort it
upon him, saying, “Where is thine?” inasmuch as he points with his finger to some stone,
and says, “Lo, there is my God!” When I have laughed at the stone, and he who pointed to
it has been put to the blush, he raises his eyes from the stone, looks up to heaven, and perhaps
says, pointing his finger to the Sun, “Behold there my God! Where, I pray, is your God?”
He has found something to point out to the eyes of the flesh; whereas I, on my part, not that
I have not a God to show to him, cannot show him what he has no eyes to see. For he indeed
could point out to my bodily eyes his God, the Sun; but what eyes hath he to which I might
point out the Creator of the Sun?…
7. “I thought on these things, and poured out my soul above myself”1234 (ver. 4). When
would my soul attain to that object of its search, which is “above my soul,” if my soul were

Psalm XLII
not to “pour itself out above itself”? For were it to rest in itself, it would not see anything
else beyond itself; and in seeing itself, would not, for all that, see God. Let then my insulting
enemies now say, “Where is thy God?” aye, let them say it! I, so long as I do not “see,” so
long as my happiness is postponed, make my tears my “bread day and night.” Let them still
say, “Where is thy God?” I seek my God in every corporeal nature, terrestrial or celestial,
and find Him not: I seek His Substance in my own soul, and I find it not, yet still I have
thought on these things, and wishing to “see the invisible things of my God, being understood
by the things made,”1235 I have poured forth my soul above myself, and there remains no
longer any being for me to attain to, save my God. For it is “there” is the “house of my God.”
His dwelling-place is above my soul; from thence He beholds me; from thence He created
me; from thence He directs me and provides for me; from thence he appeals to1236 me, and
calls me, and directs me; leads me in the way, and to the end of my way.1237…
8. For when I was “pouring out my soul above myself,” in order to reach my God, why
did I do so? “For I will go into the place of Thy Tabernacle.” For I should be in error were
I to seek for my God without “the place of His tabernacle.” “For I will go into the place of
Thy wonderful tabernacle, even unto the house of God.”
“I will go,” he says, “into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even unto the house of
God!” For there are already many things that I admire in “the tabernacle.” See how great
wonders I admire in the tabernacle! For God’s tabernacle on earth is the faithful; I admire
in them the obedience of even their bodily members: that in them “Sin does not reign so
that they should obey its lusts; neither do they yield their members instruments of unright-
eousness unto sin; but unto the living God in good works.”1238 I admire the sight of the
bodily members warring in the service of the soul that serves God.…And wonderful though
the tabernacle be, yet when I come to “the house of God,” I am even struck dumb with as-
tonishment. Of that “house” he speaks in another Psalm, after he had put a certain abstruse
and difficult question to himself (viz., why is it that it generally goes well with the wicked
on earth, and ill with the good?), saying, “I thought to know this; it is too painful for me,
until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand of the last things.”1239 For it is there,
in the sanctuary of God, in the house of God, is the fountain of “understanding.” There he
“understood of the last things;” and solved the question concerning the prosperity of the
powers of sensation and of thought, and thereby conscious of our own being, for being is implied in the exercise
of the powers of thought and sensation.”

unrighteous, and the sufferings of the righteous. How does he solve it? Why, that the wicked,
when reprieved here, are reserved for punishments without end; and the good when they
suffer here, are being tried in order that they may in the end obtain the inheritance. And it
was in the sanctuary of God that he understood this, and “understood of the last things.”…For
he tells us of his progress, and of his guidance thither; as if we had been saying, “You are
admiring the tabernacle here on earth; how came you to the sanctuary of the house of God?”
he says, “In the voice of joy and praise; the sound of keeping holiday.” Here, when men keep
festival simply for their own indulgence, it is their custom to place musical instruments, or
to station a chorus of singers, 1240 before their houses, or any kind of music that serves and
allures to wantonness. And when these are heard, what do we passers by say? “What is going
on here?” And we are told in answer, that it is some festival. “It is a birthday that is being
celebrated” (say they), “there is a marriage here;” that those songs may not appear out of
place, but the luxurious indulgence1241 may be excused by the festive occasion. In the “house
of God” there is a never-ending festival: for there it is not an occasion celebrated once, and
then to pass away.1242 The angelic choir makes an eternal “holiday:” the presence of God’s
face, joy that never fails. This is a “holiday” of such a kind, as neither to be opened by any
dawn, nor terminated by any evening. From that everlasting perpetual festivity, a certain
sweet and melodious strain strikes on the ears of the heart, provided only the world do not
drown the sounds. As he walks in this tabernacle, and contemplates God’s wonderful works
for the redemption of the faithful, the sound of that festivity charms his ears, and bears the
“hart” away to “the water-brooks.”
9. But seeing, brethren, so long as “we are at home in this body, we are absent from the
Lord;”1243 and “the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle
weigheth down the mind that museth on many things;”1244 even though we have some way
or other dispersed the clouds, by walking as “longing” leads us on, and for a brief while have
come within reach of that sound, so that by an effort we may catch something from that
“house of God,” yet through the burden, so to speak, of our infirmity, we sink back to our
usual level, and relapse to our ordinary state.1245 And just as there we found cause for re-
joicing, so here there will not be wanting an occasion for sorrow. For that hart that made
“tears” its “bread day and night,” borne along by “longing to the water-brooks” (that is, to

the spiritual delights of God), “pouring forth his soul above himself,” that he may attain to
what is “above” his own soul, walking towards “the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even
unto the house of God,” and led on by the sweetness of that inward spiritual1246 sound to
feel contempt for all outward things, and be borne on to things spiritual, is but a mortal
man still; is still groaning here, still bearing about the frailty of flesh, still in peril in the midst
of the “offences”1247 of this world. He therefore glances back to himself,1248 as if he were
coming from that world; and says to himself, now placed in the midst of these sorrows,
comparing these with the things, to see which he had entered in there, and after seeing which
he had come forth from thence;
“Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me?” (ver. 5). Lo, we
have just now been gladdened by certain inward delights: with the mind’s eye we have been
able to behold, though but with a momentary glance, something not susceptible of change:
why dost thou still “disquiet me, why art thou” still “cast down”? For thou dost not doubt
of thy God. For now thou art not without somewhat to say to thyself, in answer to those
who say, “Where is thy God?” I have now had the perception of something that is unchange-
able; why dost thou disquiet me still?
“Hope in God.” Just as if his soul was silently replying to him, “Why do I disquiet thee,
but because I am not yet there, where that delight is, to which I was, as it were, rapt for a
moment?1249 Am I already ‘drinking’ from this ‘fountain’ with nothing to fear?”…Still
“Hope in God,” is his answer to the soul that disquiets him, and would fain account for her
disquiet from the evils with which this world abounds. In the mean while dwell in hope: for
“hope that is seen is not hope; but if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
wait for it.”1250
10. “Hope in God.” Why “hope”? “For I will confess unto Him.” What wilt thou “con-
fess”? “My God is the saving health of my countenance.” My “health” (my salvation) cannot
be from myself; this it is that I will say, that I will “confess.” It is my God that is “the saving
health of my countenance.”1251 For to account for his fears, in the midst of those things,
competent to gain. Man is of dust; ethereal hopes are his, Which, when they should sustain themselves aloft,
Want due consistence; like a pillar of smoke That with majestic energy from earth Rises, but having reach’d the
thinner air Melts and dissolves, and is no longer seen.” Compare also p. 122:— “Alas! the endowment of immortal
power Is match’d unequally with custom, time, And domineering faculties of sense In all…in most with super-
added foes,” etc.

which he now knows, having come after a sort to the “understanding” of them,1252 he has
been looking behind him again in anxiety, lest the enemy be stealing upon him: he cannot
yet say, “I am made whole every whit.” For having but “the first-fruits of the Spirit, we groan
within ourselves; waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body.”1253 When
that “health” (that salvation) is perfected in us, then shall we be living in the house of God
for ever, and praising for ever Him to whom it was said, “Blessed are they that dwell in Thy
house, they will be praising Thee world without end.”1254 This is not so yet, because the
salvation which is promised, is not as yet in being; but it is “in hope” that I confess unto
God, and say, “My God is the saving health of my countenance.” For it is “in hope” that “we
are saved; but hope that is seen, is not hope.”…
11. “My soul is disquieted on account of myself”1255 (ver. 6). Is it disquieted on account
of God? It is on my own account it is disquieted. By the Unchangeable it was revived; it is
by the changeable it is disquieted. I know that the righteousness of God remaineth; whether
my own will remain stedfast, I know not. For I am alarmed by the Apostle’s saying, “Let
him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.”1256 Therefore since “there is no
soundness in me for myself,” there is no hope either for me of myself. “My soul is disquieted
on account of myself.”…“Therefore I remember Thee, O Lord, from the land of Jordan,
and from the little hill of Hermon.” From whence did I remember thee? From the “little
hill,” and from the “land of Jordan.” Perhaps from Baptism, where the remission of sins is
given. For no one runs to the remission of sins, except he who is dissatisfied with himself;
no one runs to the remission of sins, but he who confesses himself a sinner; no one confesses
himself a sinner, except by humbling himself before God. Therefore it is from “the land of
Jordan I have remembered thee, and from the hill;” observe, not “of the great hill,” that thou
mayest make of the “little hill” a great one: for “whoso exalteth himself shall be abased, and
whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.” If you would also ask the meanings of the names,
Jordan means “their descent.” Descend then, that thou mayest be “lifted up:” be not lifted
up, lest thou be cast down. “And the little hill of Hermon.” Hermon means “anathematizing.”
Anathematize thyself, by being displeased with thyself; for if thou art pleased with thyself,
God will be displeased with thee. Because then God gives us all good things, because He

Himself is good, not because we are worthy of it; because He is merciful, not because we
have in anything deserved it; it is from “the land of Jordan, and from Hermon,” that I re-
member thee. And because he so remembers with humility, he shall earn his exaltation to
fruition,1257 for he is not “exalted” in himself, who “glories in the Lord.”
12. “Deep calleth unto deep with the voice of thy water-spouts”1258 (ver. 7). I may per-
haps finish the Psalm, aided as I am by your attention, whose fervour I perceive. As for your
fatigue in hearing, I am not greatly solicitous, since you see me also, who speak, toiling in
the heat of these exertions.1259 Assuredly it is from your seeing me labouring, that you labour
with me: for I am labouring not for myself, but for you. “Deep calleth unto deep with the
voice of thy water-spouts.” It was God whom he addressed, who “remembered him from
the land of Jordan and Hermon.” It was in wonder and admiration he spake this: “Abyss
calleth unto abyss with the voice of Thy water-spouts.” What abyss is this that calls, and to
what other abyss? Justly, because the “understanding” 1260 spoken of is an “abyss.” For an
“abyss” is a depth that cannot be reached or comprehended; and it is principally applied to
a great body of water. For there is a “depth,” a “profound,” the bottom of which cannot be
reached by sounding. Furthermore, it is said in a certain passage,1261 “Thy judgments are
a mighty abyss,” Scripture meaning to suggest that the judgments of God are incomprehens-
ible. What then is the “abyss” that calls, and to what other “abyss” does it call? If by “abyss”
we understand a great depth, is not man’s heart, do you not suppose, “an abyss”? For what
is there more profound than that “abyss”? Men may speak, may be seen by the operations
of their members, may be heard speaking in conversation: but whose thought is penetrated,
whose heart seen into? What he is inwardly engaged on, what he is inwardly capable of,1262
what he is inwardly doing or what purposing, what he is inwardly wishing to happen, or
not to happen, who shall comprehend? I think an “abyss” may not unreasonably be under-
stood of man, of whom it is said elsewhere, “Man shall come to a deep heart, and God shall
be exalted.”1263 If man then is an “abyss,” in what way doth “abyss” call on “abyss”? Does
man “call on” man as God is called upon? No, but “calls on” is equivalent to “calls to him.”
For it was said of a certain person, he calls on death;1264 that is, lives in such a way as to be
inviting death; for there is no man at all who puts up a prayer, and calls expressly on death:

1264 Wisd. i. 16.
Psalm XLII
but men by evil-living invite death. “Deep1265 calls on deep,” then, is, “man calls to man.”
Thus is it wisdom is learnt, and thus faith, when “man calls to man.” The holy preachers of
God’s word call on the “deep:” are they not themselves “a deep” also?…
13. “Deep calleth to deep with the voice of Thy water-spouts.” I, who tremble all over,
when my soul was disquieted on account of myself, feared greatly on account of Thy
“judgments.”…Are those judgments slight ones? They are great ones, severe, hard to bear;
but would they were all. “Deep calls to deep with the voice of Thy water-spouts,” in that
Thou threatenest, Thou sayest, that there is another condemnation in store even after those
sufferings. “Deep calls on deep with the voice of Thy water-spouts.” “Whither then shall I
go from Thy presence? And whither shall I flee from Thy Spirit?” seeing that deep calls to
deep, and after those sufferings severer ones are to be dreaded.
14. “All Thy overhangings1266 and Thy waves are come upon me.” The “waves” in what
I already feel, the “overhangings” in that Thou denouncest. All my sufferings are Thy waves;
all Thy denouncements of judgments are Thy “overhangings.” In the “waves” that deep
“calleth;” in the “overhangings” is the other “deep” which it “calls to.” In this that I suffer
are all Thy waves; in the severer punishment that Thou threatenest, all Thy “overhangings”
are come unto me. For He who threatens does not let His judgments fall upon us, but keeps
them suspended over us.1267 But inasmuch as Thou sittest at liberty, I have thus spoken
unto my soul. “Hope in God: for I will confess unto Him. My God is the saving health of
my countenance.” The more numerous my sufferings, the sweeter will be Thy mercy.
15. Therefore follows: “The Lord will commend His loving-kindness in the day-time;
and in the night-time will He declare it”1268 (ver. 8). In tribulation no man has leisure to
hear: attend, when it is well with you; hear, when it is well with you; learn, when you are in
tranquillity, the discipline of wisdom, and store up the word of God as you do food. For in
tribulation every one must be profited by what he heard in the time of security. For in
prosperity God “commends to thee His mercy,” in case thou serve Him faithfully, for He
frees thee from tribulation; but it is “in the night” only that He “declares” His mercy to thee,
which He “commended” to thee by day. When tribulation shall actually come, He will not
leave thee destitute of His help; He will show thee that which He commended to thee in the
daytime is true. For it is written in a certain passage, “The mercy of the Lord is seasonable1269
in the time of affliction, as clouds of rain in the time of drought.” “The Lord hath commended
His loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night will He declare it.” He does not show
1265 Abyssum invocat.
1266 Suspensiones; Vulgate, excelsa; E.V. “billows.”
1267 Non premit sed suspendit. Perhaps his idea is rather, “suspends us over the abyss.”

1269 Ecclus. xxxv. 26. ῾Ωραῖον žλεος; Vulgate, Speciosa misericordia.
Psalm XLII
that He is thine Helper, unless tribulation come, from whence thou must be rescued by Him
who promised it to thee “in the day-time.” Therefore we are warned to be like “the ant.” For
just as worldly prosperity is signified by “the day,” adversity by the night, so again in another
way worldly prosperity is expressed by “the summer,” adversity by the winter. And what is
it that the ant does? She lays up in summer what will be useful to her in winter. Whilst
therefore it is summer, whilst it is well with you, whilst you are in tranquillity, hear the word
of the Lord. For how can it be that in the midst of these tempests of the world, you should
pass through the whole of that sea, without suffering? How could it happen? To what mortal’s
lot has it fallen? If even it has been the lot of any, that very calm is more to be dreaded. “The
Lord hath commended His loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night-time will He
declare it.”…“There is with me prayer unto the God of my life.” This I make my business
here; I who am the “hart thirsting and longing for the water-brooks,” calling to mind the
sweetness of that strain, by which I was led on through the tabernacle even to the house of
God; whilst this “corruptible body presseth down the soul,” 1270 there is yet with me
“prayer unto the God of my life.” For in order to making supplication unto God, I have not
to buy aught from places beyond the sea; or in order that He may hear me, have I to sail to
bring from a distance frankincense and perfumes, or have I to bring “calf or ram from the
flock.” There is “with me prayer to the God of my life.” I have within a victim to sacrifice;
I have within an incense to place on the altar; I have within a sacrifice wherewith to propitiate
my God. “The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit.” What sacrifice of a “troubled spirit” I
have within, hear.
16. “I will say unto God, Thou art my lifter up. Why hast Thou forgotten me?” (ver. 9).
For I am suffering here, even as if Thou hadst forgotten me. But Thou art trying me, and I
know that Thou dost but put off, not take utterly from me, what Thou hast promised me.
But yet, “Why hast Thou forgotten me?” So cried our Head also, as if speaking in our name.
“My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?” 1271 I will say unto God, “Thou art my
lifter up; why hast Thou forgotten me?”
17. “Why hast Thou rejected me?”1272 “Rejected” me, that is to say, from that height of
the apprehension of the unchangeable Truth. “Why hast Thou rejected me?” Why, when
already longing for those things, have I been cast down to these, by the weight1273 and
burden of my iniquity? This same voice in another passage said, “I said in my trance”1274
(i.e., in my rapture, when he had seen some great thing or other), “I said in my trance, I am

cast out of the sight of Thine eyes.” For he compared these things in which he found himself,
to those toward which he had been raised; and saw himself cast out far “from the sight of
God’s eyes,” as he speaks even here, “Why hast Thou rejected me? Why go I mourning,
while mine enemy troubleth me, while he breaketh my bones?” Even he, my tempter, the
devil; while offences are everywhere on the increase, because of the abundance of which
“the love of many is waxing cold.”1275 When we see the strong members of the Church
generally giving way to the causes of offence, does not Christ’s body say, “The enemy
breaketh my bones”? For it is the strong members that are “the bones;” and sometimes even
those that are strong sink under their temptations. For whosoever of the body of Christ
considers this, does he not exclaim, with the voice of Christ’s Body, “Why hast Thou rejected
me? Why go I mourning, while mine enemy troubleth me, while he breaketh my bones?”
You may see not my flesh merely, but even my “bones.” To see those who were thought
to have some stability, giving way under temptations, so that the rest of the weak brethren
despair when they see those who are strong succumbing; how great, my brethren, are the
dangers!
18. “They who trouble me cast me in the teeth.” Again that voice! “While they say daily
unto me, Where is thy God?” (ver. 10). And it is principally in the temptations of the Church
they say this, “Where is thy God?” How much was this cast in the teeth of the Martyrs! Those
men so patient and courageous for the name of Christ, how often was it said to them, “Where
is your God?” “Let Him deliver you, if He can.” For men saw their torments outwardly; they
did not inwardly behold their crowns! “They who trouble me cast me in the teeth, while
they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?” And on this account, seeing “my soul is disquieted
on account of myself,” what else should I say unto it than those words:
“Why art thou cast down, O my soul; and why dost thou disquiet me?” (ver. 11). And,
as it seems to answer, “Wouldest thou not have me disquiet thee, placed as I am here in so
great evils? Wouldest thou have me not disquiet thee, panting as I am after what is good,
thirsting and labouring as I am for it?” What should I say, but,
“Hope thou in God; for I will yet confess unto Him” (ver. 11). He states the very words
of that confession; he repeats the grounds on which he fortifies his hope. “He is the health
of my countenance, and my God.”
1275 Matt. xxiv. 12.
Psalm XLII
Psalm XLIII.1276
1. This Psalm is a short one; it satisfies the mental cravings of the hearers, without im-
posing too severe a trial on the hunger of those fasting.1277 Let our soul feed upon it; our
soul, which he who sings in this Psalm, speaks of as “cast down;” cast down, I suppose, either
in consequence of some fist, or rather in consequence of some hunger he was in. For fasting
is a voluntary act; being an-hungered is an involuntary thing. That which is an-hungered,
is the Church, is the Body of Christ: and that “Man” who is extended throughout the whole
world, of which the Head is above, the limbs below: it is His voice which ought by this time
to be perfectly known, and perfectly familiar, to us, in all the Psalms; now chanting joyously,
now sorrowing; now rejoicing in hope, now sighing at its actual state, even as if it were our
own. We need not then dwell long on pointing out to you, who is the speaker here: let each
one of us be a member of Christ’s Body; and he will be speaker here.…
2. “Judge me, O Lord, and separate my cause from the ungodly nation” (ver. 1). I do
not dread Thy judgment, because I know Thy mercy. “Judge me, O God,” he cries. Now,
meanwhile, in this state of pilgrimage, Thou dost not yet separate my place, because I am
to live together with the “tares” even to the time of the “harvest:” Thou dost not as yet sep-
arate my rain from theirs; my light from theirs: “separate my cause.” Let a difference be
made between him who believes in Thee, and him who believes not in Thee. Our infirmity
is the same; but our consciences not the same: our sufferings the same; but our longings not
the same. “The desire of the ungodly shall perish,”1278 but as to the desire of the righteous,
we might well doubt, if He were not “sure” who promised. The object of our desires is He
Himself, who promiseth: He will give us Himself, because He has already given Himself to
us; He will give Himself in His immortality to us then immortal, even because He gave
Himself in His mortality to us when mortal.…
3. And since patience is needful in order to endure, until the harvest, a certain distinction
without separation,1279 if we may so speak (for they are together with us, and therefore not
yet separated; the tares however being still tares, and the corn still corn, and therefore they
are already distinct); since then a kind of strength1280 is needful, which must be implored
of Him who bids us to be strong, and without whose making us strong, we should not be
what He bids us to be; of Him who said, “He that endures unto the end shall be saved,”1281

Psalm XLIII
Psalm XLIII
lest the soul’s powers should be impaired in consequence of her ascribing any strength to
herself, he subjoins immediately,
“For Thou, O God, art my strength: why hast Thou cast me off, and why go I mourning,
while the enemy harasseth me?” (ver. 2). I go mourning: the enemy is harassing me with
daily temptations: inspiring either some unlawful love, or some ungrounded cause of fear;
and the soul that fights against both of them, though not taken prisoner by them, yet being
in danger from them, is contracted with sorrow, and says unto God, “Why?”
Let her then ask of Him, and hear “Why?” For she is in the Psalm enquiring the cause
of her dejection; saying, “Why hast Thou cast me off? and why go I mourning?” Let her hear
from Isaiah; let the lesson which has just been read, suggest itself to her. “The spirit shall go
forth from me, and every breath have I made. For iniquity have I a little afflicted him; I hid
my face from him, and he departed from me sorrowful in the ways of his heart.” 1282 Why
then didst thou ask, “Why hast Thou cast me off, and why go I mourning?” Thou hast heard,
it was “for iniquity.” “Iniquity” is the cause of thy mourning; let “Righteousness” be the
cause of thy rejoicing! Thou wouldest sin; and yet thou wouldest fain not suffer; so that it
was too little for thee to be thyself unrighteous, without also wishing Him to be unrighteous,
in that thou wouldest fain not be punished by Him. Consider a speech of a better kind in
another Psalm. “It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me, that I might learn Thy
righteousnesses.”1283 By being lifted up, I had learned my own iniquities; let me by being
“humbled,” learn “Thy righteousnesses.” “Why go I mourning, while the enemy harasses
me?” Thou complainest of the enemy. It is true he does harass thee; but it was thou didst
“give place”1284 to him. And even now there is a course open to thee; choose the course of
prudence; admit thy King, shut the tyrant out.
4. But in order that she may do this, hear what she says, what she supplicates, what she
prays for. Pray thou for what thou hearest; pray for it when thou hearest it; let these words
be the voice of us all: “O send out Thy Light and Thy Truth. They have led me, and brought
me on unto Thy holy hill, and into Thy Tabernacles” (ver. 3). For that very “Light” and
“Truth” are indeed two in name; the reality expressed is but One. For what else is the “Light”
of God, except the “Truth” of God? Or what else is the “Truth” of God, except the “Light”
of God? And the one Person of Christ is both of these. “I am the Light of the world: he that
believeth on Me, shall not walk in darkness.” “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.”1285
He is Himself “the Light:” He is Himself “the Truth.” Let Him come then and rescue us,
and “separate at once our cause from the ungodly nation; let Him deliver us from the deceitful

and unjust man,” let him separate the wheat from the tares, for at the time of harvest He
will Himself send His Angels, that they may “gather out of His kingdom all things that of-
fend,”1286 and cast them into flaming fire, while they gather together the corn into the
garner. He will send out His “Light,” and His “Truth;” for that they have already “brought
us and led us to His holy hill, and into His Tabernacles.” We possess the “earnest;”1287 we
hope for the prize. “His holy Hill” is His holy Church. It is that mountain which, according
to Daniel’s vision,1288 grew from a very small “stone,” till it crushed the kingdoms of the
earth; and grew to such a size, that it “filled the face of the earth.” This is the “hill,” from
which he tells us that his prayer was heard, who says, “I cried unto the Lord with my voice,
and He heard me out of His holy hill.”1289 Let no one of those that are without that mountain,
hope to be heard unto eternal life. For many are heard in their prayers for many things. Let
them not congratulate themselves1290 on being heard; the devils were heard in their prayer,
that they might be sent into the swine. Let us desire to be heard unto eternal life, by reason
of our longing, through which we say, “Send out Thy Light and Thy Truth.”1291 That is a
“Light” which requires the eye of the heart. For “Blessed” (He saith) “are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.”1292 We are now on His Hill, that is, in His Church, and in His
Tabernacle. The “tabernacle” is for persons sojourning; the house, for those dwelling in one
community.1293 The tabernacle is also for those who are both from home, and also in a state
of warfare. When thou hearest of a tabernacle, form a notion of a war; guard against an en-
emy. But what shall the house be? “Blessed are they that dwell in Thine house: they will be
alway praising Thee.”1294
5. Now then that we have been led on even to “the Tabernacle,” and are placed on “His
holy Hill,” what hope do we carry with us?
“Then will I go in unto the Altar of God” (ver. 4). For there is a certain invisible Altar
on high, which the unrighteous man approaches not. To that Altar he alone draws nigh,
who draws nigh to this one without cause to fear. There he shall find his Life, who in this
one “separates his cause.” “And I will go in unto the Altar of God.” From His holy Hill, and
from His Tabernacle, from His Holy Church, I will go in unto the Altar of God on High.

Psalm XLIII
What manner of Sacrifice is there? He himself who goeth in is taken for a burnt-offering.
“I will go in unto the Altar of God.” What is the meaning of what he says, “The Altar of my
God”?
“Unto God, who makes glad my youth.” Youth signifies newness: just as if he said,
“Unto God, who makes glad my newness.” It is He who makes glad my newness, who hath
filled my old estate1295 with mourning. For now “I go mourning” in oldness, then shall “I
stand,” exulting in newness!
“Yea, upon the harp will I praise Thee, O God my God.” What is the meaning of
“praising on the harp,” and praising on the psaltery? For he does not always do so with the
harp, nor always with the psaltery. These two instruments of the musicians have each a
distinct meaning of their own, worthy of our consideration and notice. They are both borne
in the hands, and played by the touch; and they stand for certain bodily works of ours. Both
are good, if one knows how to play the psaltery,1296 or to play the harp.1297 But since the
psaltery is that instrument which has the shell1298 (i.e. that drum, that hollow piece of wood,
by straining on which1299 the chords resound) on the upper part of it, whereas the harp has
that same concave sounding-board on the lower part, there is to be a distinction made
between our works, when they are “upon the harp,” when “on the psaltery:” both however
are acceptable to God, and grateful to His ear. When we do anything according to God’s
Commandments, obeying His commands and hearkening to Him, that we may fulfil His
injunctions, when we are active and not passive, it is the psaltery that is playing. For so also
do the Angels: for they have nothing to suffer. But when we suffer anything of tribulation,
of trials, of offences on this earth (as we suffer only from the inferior part of ourselves; i.e.
from the fact that we are mortal, that we owe somewhat of tribulation to our original
cause,1300 and also from the fact of our suffering much from those who are not “above”);
this is “the harp.” For there rises a sweet strain from that part of us which is “below:” we
“suffer,” and we strike the psaltery,1301 or shall I rather say we sing and we strike the harp.…
6. And again, in order that he may draw the sound from that sounding-board below,
he addresses his soul: he says, “Why art thou sorrowful, O my soul, and why dost thou dis-
quiet me?” (ver. 5). I am in tribulations, in weariness,1302 in mourning, “Why dost thou

Psalm XLIII
disquiet me, O my soul?” Who is the speaker, to whom is he speaking? That it is the soul to
which he is speaking, everybody knows: for it is obvious: the appeal is addressed to it directly:
“Why art thou sorrowful, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me?” The question is as
to the speaker. It is not the flesh addressing the soul, surely, since the flesh cannot speak
without the soul. For it is more appropriate for the soul to address the flesh, than for the
flesh to address the soul.…We perceive then that we have a certain part, in which is “the
image of God;” viz. the mind and reason.1303 It was that same mind that prayed for “God’s
Light” and “God’s Truth.” It is the same mind by which we apprehend1304 right and wrong:
it is by the same that we discern truth from falsehood. It is this same that we call “under-
standing;” which “understanding,” indeed, is wanting to the brutes. And this “understanding”
whoever neglects in himself, and holds it in less account than the other parts of his nature,
and casts it off, just as if he had it not, is addressed in the Psalm, “Be ye not as the horse and
the mule, which have no understanding.” 1305 It is our “understanding” then that is address-
ing our soul. The latter is withered away from tribulations, worn out in anguish,1306 made
“sorrowful” in temptations, fainting in toils. The mind, catching a glimpse of Truth above,
would fain rouse her spirits, and she says, “Why art thou sorrowful, O my soul?”…
7. These expressions, brethren, are safe ones: but yet be watchful in good works. Touch
“the psaltery,” by obeying the Commandments; touch the harp, by patiently enduring your
sufferings. You have heard from Isaiah, “Break thy bread to the hungry;”1307 think not that
fasting by itself is sufficient. Fasting chasteneth thine own self: it does not refresh others.
Thy distress will profit thee, if thou affordest comfort1308 to others. See, thou hast denied
thyself; to whom wilt thou give that of which thou hast deprived thyself? Where wilt thou
bestow what thou hast denied thyself? How many poor may be filled1309 by the breakfast1310
we1311 have this day given up? Fast in such a way that thou mayest rejoice, that thou hast
breakfasted, while another has been eating; fast on account of thy prayers, that thou mayest
be heard in them. For He says in that passage, “Whilst thou art yet speaking I will say, Here
I am,”1312 provided thou wilt with cheerful mind “break thy bread to the hungry.” For

generally this is done by men reluctantly and with murmurs, to rid themselves of the wear-
isome importunity of the beggar, not to refresh the bowels of him that is needy. But it is “a
cheerful giver” that “God loves.”1313 If thou givest thy bread reluctantly, thou hast lost both
the bread, and the merit of the action. Do it then from the heart: that He “who seeth in
secret,”1314 may say, “whilst thou art yet speaking, Here I am.” How speedily are the prayers
of those received, who work righteousness! And this is man’s righteousness in this life,
fasting, alms, and prayer. Wouldest thou have thy prayer fly upward to God? Make for it
those two wings of alms and fasting. Such may God’s “Light” and God’s “Truth” find us,
that He may find us without cause for fear, when He comes to free us from death, who has
already come to undergo death for us. Amen.

Psalm XLIII
Psalm XLIV.1315
1. This Psalm is addressed “to the sons of Korah,” as its title shows. Now Korah is
equivalent to the word baldness;1316 and we find in the Gospel that our Lord Jesus Christ
was crucified in “the place of a skull.”1317 It is clear then that this Psalm is sung to the “sons
of His ‘Passion.’” Now we have on this point a most certain and most evident testimony
from the Apostle Paul; because that at the time when the Church was suffering under the
persecutions of the Gentiles, he quoted from hence a verse, to insert by way of consolation,
and encouragement to patience. For that which he inserted in his Epistle, is said here: “For
Thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.”1318 Let
us then hear in this Psalm the voice of the Martyrs; and see how good is the cause which
the voice of the Martyrs pleads, saying, For Thy sake, etc.…
2. The title then is not simply “To the sons of Korah,” but, “For understanding, to the
sons of Korah.” This is the case also with that Psalm, the first verse of which the Lord
Himself uttered on the Cross: “My God, My God, look upon Me; why hast Thou forsaken
Me?”1319 For “transferring us in a figure”1320 to what He was saying, and to His own Body
(for we are also “His Body,” and He is our “Head”), He uttered from the Cross not His own
cry, but ours. For God never “forsook” Him: nor did He Himself ever depart from the
Father; but it was in behalf of us that He spake this: “My God, My God, why hast thou for-
saken Me?” For there follows, “Far from My health are the words of My offences:” and it
shows in whose person He said this; for sin could not be found in Him.…
3. “O God, we have heard with our ears; our fathers have told us the work that Thou
didst in their days, and in the days of old” (ver. 1). Wondering wherefore, in these days, He
has seemingly forsaken those whom it was His will to exercise in sufferings, they recall the
past events which they have heard of from their fathers; as if they said, It is not of these
things that we suffer, that our fathers told us! For in that other Psalm also, He said this, “Our
fathers trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. But I am a worm and no
man; a reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.”1321 They trusted, and Thou didst
deliver them; have I then hoped, and hast Thou forsaken me? And have I believed upon
Thee in vain? And is it in vain that my name has been written in Thy Book,1322 and Thy
name has been inscribed on me? What our fathers told us was this:

Psalm XLIV
Psalm XLIV
“Thy hand destroyed the nations; and Thou plantedst them: Thou didst weaken the
peoples, and cast them out” (ver. 2). That is to say: “Thou didst drive out ‘the peoples’ from
their own land, that Thou mightest bring ‘them’ in, and plant them; and mightest by Thy
mercy stablish their kingdom.” These are the things that we heard from our fathers. But
perhaps it was because they were brave, were men of battle, were invincible, were well-dis-
ciplined, and warlike, that they could do these things. Far from it. This is not what our
fathers told us; this is not what is contained in Scripture. But what does it say, but what fol-
lows?
“For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm
save them; but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance” (ver. 3).
Thy “right hand” is Thy Power: Thine “arm” is Thy Son Himself.1323 And “the light of Thy
countenance.” What means this, but that Thou wert present with them, in miracles of such
a sort that Thy presence was perceived. For when God’s presence with us appears by any
miracle, do we see His face with our own eyes? No. It is by the effect of the miracle He in-
timates to man His presence. In fact, what do all persons say, who express wonder at facts
of this description? “I saw God present.” “But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light
of Thy countenance; because Thou pleasedst in them:”1324 i.e. didst so deal with them, that
Thou wert well-pleasing in them: that whoso considered how they were being dealt with,
might say, that “God is with them of a truth;” and it is God that moves1325 them.
4. “What? Was He then other than now He is?” Away with the supposition. For what
follows?
“Thou art Thyself1326 my King and my God.” (ver. 4). “Thou art Thyself;” for Thou art
not changed. I see that the times are changed; but the Creator of times is unchanged. “Thou
art Thyself my King and my God.” Thou art wont to guide me: to govern me, to save me.
“Thou who commandest salvation unto Jacob.” What is, “Thou who commandest”? Even
though in Thine own proper Substance and Nature, in which Thou art whatsoever Thou
art, Thou wast hid from them; and though Thou didst not converse with the fathers in that
which Thou art in Thyself, so that they could see Thee “face to face,” yet by any created being
whatsoever “Thou commandest salvation unto Israel.” For that sight of Thee “face to face”
is reserved for those set free in the Resurrection. And the very “fathers” of the New Testament
too, although they saw Thy mysteries revealed, although they preached the secret things so
revealed to them, nevertheless said that they themselves saw but “in a glass, darkly,” but that
“seeing face to face” 1327 is reserved to a future time, when what the Apostle himself speaks

1324 Complacuisti in eis.
1325 Agit.
1326 “Tu es Ipse.”
1327 1 Cor. xiii. 12.
Psalm XLIV
of shall have come. “When Christ our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him
in glory.”1328 It is against that time then that vision “face to face” is reserved for you, of
which John also speaks: “Beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be. We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall
see Him as He is.”1329 Although then at that time our fathers saw Thee not as Thou art,
“face to face,” although that vision is reserved against the resurrection, yet, even though
they were Angels who presented themselves, it is Thou, “Who commandest salvation unto
Jacob.” Thou art not only present by Thine own Self; but by whatsoever created being Thou
didst appear, it is Thou that dost “command” by them, that which Thou doest by Thine
own Self in order to the salvation of Thy servants: but that which they do whom Thou
“commandest” it, is done to procure the salvation of Thy servants. Since then Thou art
Thyself “my King and my God, and Thou commandest salvation unto Jacob,” wherefore
are we suffering these things?
5. But perhaps it is only what is past that has been described to us: but nothing of the
kind is to be hoped for by us for the future. Nay indeed, it is still to be hoped for. “Through
Thee will we winnow away1330 our enemies” (ver. 5). Our fathers then have declared to us
a work that Thou didst “in their days, and in the days of old,” that Thy hand destroyed the
Gentiles: that Thou “didst cast out the peoples; and didst plant them.” Such was the past;
but what is to be hereafter? “Through Thee we shall winnow away our enemies.” A time
will come, when all the enemies of Christians will be winnowed away like chaff, be blown
like dust, and be cast off from the earth.…Thus much of the future. “I will not trust in my
bow,” even as our fathers did not in “their sword. Neither shall my sword help me” (ver. 6).
6. “For Thou hast saved us from our enemies” (ver. 7). This too is spoken of the future
under the figure of the past. But this is the reason that it is spoken of as if it were past, that
it is as certain as if it were past. Give heed, wherefore many things are expressed by the
Prophets as if they were past; whereas it is things future, not past facts that are the subject
of prophecy. For the future Passion of our Lord Himself was foretold:1331 and yet it says,
“They pierced My hands and My feet. They told all My bones;” not, “They shall pierce,” and
“shall tell.” “They looked and stared upon Me;” not “They shall look and stare upon Me.”
“They parted My garments among them.” It does not say, “They shall part” them. All these
things are expressed as if they were past, although they were yet to come: because to God
things to come also are as certain as if they were past.…It is for this reason, in consequence
of their certainty, that those things which are yet future, are spoken of as if past. This it is

1331 Ps. xxii. 16–18.
Psalm XLIV
then that we hope. For it is, “Thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
shame that hated us.”
7. “In God will we boast1332 all the day long” (ver. 8). Observe how he intermingles
words expressive of a future time, that you may perceive that what was spoken of before as
in past time was foretold of future times. “In God will we boast all day long; and in Thy
name will we confess for ever.”1333 What is, “We shall boast”? What, “We shall confess”?
That Thou hast “saved us from our enemies;” that Thou art to give us an everlasting kingdom:
that in us are to be fulfilled the words, “Blessed are they that dwell in Thine house: they will
be always praising Thee.”1334
8. Since then we have the certainty that these things are to be hereafter, and since we
have heard from our fathers that those we spoke of were in time past, what is our state at
present? “But now Thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame” (ver. 9). Thou hast “put us
to shame” not before our own consciences, but in the sight of men. For there was a time
when Christians were persecuted; when in every place they were outcasts, when in every
place it used to be said, “He is a Christian!” as if it conveyed an insult and reproach. Where
then is He, “our God, our King,” who “commands salvation unto Jacob”? Where is He who
did all those works, which “our fathers have told us”? Where is He who is hereafter to do
all those things which He revealed unto us by His Spirit? Is He changed? No. These things
are done in order to “understanding, for the sons of Korah.” For we ought to “understand”
something of the reason, why He has willed we should suffer all these things in the mean
time. What “all things”? “But now Thou hast cast us off and put us to shame: and goest not
forth, O God, in our powers.”1335 We go forth to meet our enemies, and Thou goest not
forth with us. We see them: they are very strong, and we are without strength. Where is that
might of Thine? Where Thy “right hand,” and Thy power?1336 Where the sea dried up, and
the Egyptian pursuers overwhelmed with the waves? Where Amalek’s resistance subdued
by the sign of the Cross?1337 “And Thou, O God, goest not forth in our powers.”
9. “Thou hast turned us away backward in presence of our enemies” (ver. 10), so that
they are, as it were, before; we, behind; they are counted as conquerors, we as conquered.
“And they which hate us spoiled for themselves.” What did they “spoil” but ourselves?
10. “Thou has given us like sheep appointed for meat, and hast scattered us among the
nations” (ver. 11). We have been “devoured” by “the nations.” Those persons are meant,

who, through their sufferings, have by process of assimilation, becomes part of the “body”
of the Gentile world. For the Church mourns over them, as over members of her body, that
have been devoured. 1338
11. “Thou hast sold Thy people for no price” (ver. 12). For we see whom Thou hast
made over; what Thou hast received, we have not seen. “And there was no multitude in
their jubilees.”1339 For when the Christians were flying before the pursuit of enemies, who
were idolaters, were there then held any congregations and “jubilees” to the honour of God?
Were those Hymns chanted in concert from the Churches of God, that are wont to be sung
in concert in time of peace, and to be sounded in a sweet accord of the brotherhood in the
ears of God?
12. “Thou madest us a reproach to our neighbours; a scorn and a derision to them that
are round about us” (ver. 13). “Thou madest us a similitude1340 among the heathen” (ver.
14). What is meant by a “similitude”? It is when men in imprecating a curse make a “simil-
itude” of his name whom they detest. “So mayest thou die;” “So mayest thou be punished!”
What a number of such reproaches were then uttered! “So mayest thou be crucified!” Even
in the present day there are not wanting enemies of Christ (those very Jews themselves),
against whom whensoever we defend Christ, they say unto us, “So mayest thou die as He
did.” For they would not have inflicted that kind of death had they not an intense horror of
dying by such a death: or had they been able to comprehend what mystery was contained
in it. When the ointment is applied to the eyes of the blind man, he does not see the eye-
salve in the physician’s hand. For the very Cross was made for the benefit even of the perse-
cutors themselves. Hereby they were healed afterwards; and they believed in Him whom
they themselves had slain. “Thou madest us a similitude among the heathen; a shaking of
the head among the peoples,” a “shaking of the head” by way of insult. “They spake with
their lips, they shook the head.”1341 This they did to the Lord: this to all His Saints also,
whom they were able to pursue, to lay hold of, to mock, to betray, to afflict, and to slay.
13. “My shame is continually before me; and the confusion of my face has covered me”
(ver. 15). “For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth” (ver. 16): that is to say,
from the voice of them that insult over me, and who make it a charge against me that I
worship Thee, that I confess Thee! and who make it a charge against me that I bear that
1338 Conversely, in like manner the Fathers (so under Ps. iii. ver. 7) often explain, “Rise, Peter, kill, and eat,”
and passages where the preachers of the Gospel are represented by beasts of prey. See p. 16, supra, between notes
5 and 6. [A fanciful rendering, perhaps; but the assimilation of unclean Gentiles, and their identification with
the clean body of the Church, is strikingly illustrated by it.—C.]

name by which all charges against me shall be blotted out. “For the voice of him that re-
proacheth and blasphemeth,” that is, of him that speaketh against me. “By reason of the
enemy and the persecutor.” And what is the “understanding” conveyed here? Those things
which are told us of the time past, will not be done in our case:1342 those which are hoped
for, as to be hereafter, are not as yet manifest. Those which are past, as the leading out of
Thy people with great glory from Egypt; its deliverance from its persecutors; the guiding of
it through the nations, the placing of it in the kingdom, whence the nations had been expelled.
What are those to be hereafter? The leading of the people out of this Egypt of the world,
when Christ, our “leader” shall appear in His glory: the placing of the Saints at His right
hand; of the wicked at His left; the condemnation of the wicked with the devil to eternal
punishment; the receiving of a kingdom from Christ with the Saints to last for ever.1343
These are the things that are yet to be: the former are what are past. In the interval, what is
to be our lot? Tribulations! “Why so?” That it may be seen with respect to the soul that
worships God, to what extent it worships God; that it may be seen whether it worships Him
“freely” from whom it received salvation “freely.”…What hast thou given unto God? Thou
wert wicked, and thou wert redeemed! What hast thou given unto God? What is there that
thou hast not “received” from Him “freely”? With reason is it named “grace,” because it is
bestowed (gratis, i.e.) freely.1344 What is required of thee then is this, “that thou too
shouldest worship “Him freely;” not because He gives thee things temporal, but because He
holds out to thee things eternal.…
14. “All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee” (ver. 17). What is meant
by, “have not forgotten Thee”? “Neither have we behaved ourselves frowardly in Thy coven-
ant.”
“Our heart has not turned back; and Thou hast turned aside our goings out of Thy way”
(ver. 18). See here is “understanding,” in that “our heart has not gone back;” that we have
not “forgotten Thee, have not behaved frowardly in Thy covenant;” placed as we are in great
tribulations, and persecutions of the Gentiles. “Thou hast turned aside our goings out of
Thy way.” Our “goings” were in the pleasures of the world; our “goings” were in the midst
of temporal prosperities. Thou hast taken “our goings out of Thy way;” and hast shown
1342 In nobis.
1343 Matt. xxv. 34. St. Augustin, Ser. xviii. 4.
1344 Rom. xi. 6.
Psalm XLIV
us1345 how “strait and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life.”1346 What is meant by, “hast
turned aside our goings out of Thy way”? It is as if He said, “Ye are placed in the midst of
tribulation; ye are suffering many things; ye have already lost many things that ye loved in
this life: but I have not abandoned you on the way, the narrow way that I am teaching you.
Ye were seeking “broad ways.” What do I tell you? This is the way we go to everlasting life;
by the way ye wish to walk, ye are going to death. How “broad and wide is the road that
leads to destruction: and” how “many there be that find it! How strait and narrow the way
that leadeth unto life, and” how “few there be” that walk therein!1347 Who are the few? They
who patiently endure tribulations, patiently endure temptations; who in all these troubles
do not “fall away:” who do not rejoice in the word “for a season” only; and in the time of
tribulation fade away, as on the sun’s arising; but who have the “root” of “love,” according
to what we have lately heard read in the Gospel.1348…
15. “For Thou hast brought us low in the place of infirmity”1349 (ver. 18): therefore
Thou wilt exalt us in the place of strength. “And the shadow of death has covered us” (ver.
19). For this mortality of ours is but the “shadow” of death. The true death is condemnation
with the devil.
16. “If we have forgotten the Name of our God.” Here is the “understanding” of the
“sons of Korah.” “And stretched out our hands to a strange God” (ver. 20). “Shall not God
search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart” (ver. 21). He “knows,” and yet He
“searches them out”? If He knows the secrets of the heart, what do the words, “Shall not
God search it out,” do there? He “knows” it in Himself; He “searches it out” for our sakes.
For it is for this reason God sometimes “searches a thing out;” and speaks of that becoming
known to Himself, which He is Himself making known to thee. He is speaking of His own
work, not of His knowledge. We commonly say, “A gladsome day,” when it is fine. Yet is it
the day itself that experiences delight? No: we speak of the day as gladsome, because it fills
us with delight. And we speak of a “sullen sky.” Not that there is any such feeling in the
clouds, but because men are affected with sullenness at the sight of such an appearance of
the skies, it is called sullen for this reason, that it makes us sullen. So also God is said to
“know” when He causes us to know. God says to Abraham, “Now I know that thou fearest
1345 Oxf. mss. “hast showed us a way. What way? How,” etc. He seems to mean that God has removed such
ways as men like from the path of His Saints, and given them narrow ways. St. Ambrose takes it as a complaint
of difficulties, so great that we cannot perfectly keep to the right way. E.V. “Neither have our steps declined from
Thy way,” rightly continuing the negative.

God.”1350 Did He then not know it before then? But Abraham did not know himself till
then: for it was in that very trial he came to know himself.…And God is said to “know” that
which He had caused him to know. Did Peter know himself, when he said to the Physician,
“I will be with Thee even unto death?”1351 The Physician had felt his pulse,1352 and knew
what was going on within His patient’s soul: the patient knew it not. The crisis1353 of trial
came; and the Physician approved the correctness of His opinion: the sick man gave up his
presumption. Thus God at once “knows” it and “searches it out.” “He knows it already. Why
does He ‘search it out’?” For thy sake: that thou mayest come to know thine own self, and
mayest return thanks to Him that made thee. “Shall not God search it out?”
17. “For, for Thy sake we are killed all the day long: we are counted as sheep for the
slaughter” (ver. 22). For you may see a man being put to death; you do not know why he is
being put to death. God knoweth this. The thing in itself is hid. But some one will say to
me, “See, he is detained in prison for the name of Christ, he is a confessor for the name of
Christ.” Why do not 1354 heretics also confess the name of Christ, and yet they do not die
for His sake? Nay more; let me say it, in the Catholic Church itself, do you think there either
are, or have been wanting persons such as would suffer for the sake of glory among men?
Were there no such persons, the Apostle would not say, “Though I give my body to be
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.”1355 He knew therefore that there
might be some persons, who did this not from “charity,” but out of vainglory. It is therefore
hid from us; God alone sees this; we cannot see it. He alone can judge of this, who “knoweth
the secrets of the heart.” “For,” for Thy sake “are we killed all the day long; we are counted
as sheep for the slaughter.” I have already mentioned that from hence the Apostle Paul had
borrowed a text1356 for the encouragement of the Martyrs: that they might not “faint in the
tribulations” undergone by them for the name of Christ.1357
18. “Awake; why sleepest Thou, O Lord?” (ver. 23). Who is addressed, and who is the
speaker? Would not he be more correctly said to sleep and slumber,1358 who speaks such
words as these? He replies to you, I know what I am saying: I know that “He that keepeth

Psalm XLIV
Israel doth not sleep:”1359 but yet the Martyrs cry, “Awake; why sleepest Thou, O Lord?” O
Lord Jesus, Thou wast slain; Thou didst “sleep” in Thy Passion; to us Thou hast now “awaked”
from sleep. For “we” know that Thou hast now “awaked” again. To what purpose hast Thou
awaked and risen again? The Gentiles that persecute us, think Thee to be dead; do not believe
Thee to have risen again. “Arise Thou” then to them also! “Why sleepest Thou,” though not
to us, yet to them? For if they already believed Thee to have risen again, could they persecute
us who believe in Thee? But why do they persecute? “Destroy, slay so and so, whoever have
believed in Thee, such an one, who died an ill death!” As yet to them “Thou sleepest;” arise
to them, that they may perceive that Thou hast “awaked” again; and may be at rest. Lastly,
it has come to pass, while the Martyrs die, and say these things; while they sleep, and “awaken”
Christ, truly dead in their sleepings, Christ has, in a certain sense, risen again in the Gentiles;
i.e. it becomes believed, that He has risen again; so by degrees they themselves, becoming
converted to Christ by believing, collected a numerous body: such as the persecutors dreaded;
and the persecutions have come to an end. Why? Because Christ, who before was asleep to
them, as not believing, hath risen in the Gentiles. “Arise, and cast us not off for ever!”
19. “Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face:” as if Thou wert not present; as if thou hadst
forgotten us? “And forgettest our misery and trouble?” (ver. 24).
20. “For our soul is bowed down to the dust” (ver. 25). Where is it bowed down? “To
the dust:” i.e. dust persecutes us. They persecute us, of whom Thou hast said, “The ungodly
are not so; but are like the dust, which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth.”1360
“Our belly hath cleaved to the earth.” He seems to me to have expressed the punishment of
the extreme of humiliation, in which, when any one prostrates himself, “his belly cleaveth
to the earth.” For whosoever is humbled so as to be on his knees, has yet a lower degree of
humiliation to which he can come: but he who is so humbled, that his “belly cleaveth to the
ground,” there is no farther humiliation for him. Should one wish to do still farther, it will,
after that point, be not bowing him down, but crushing him. Perhaps then he may have
meant this: We are “bowed down very low” in this dust; there is no farther point to which
humiliation can go. Humiliation has now reached its highest point: let mercy then come
also.…
21. “Arise, O Lord, help us” (ver. 26). And indeed, dearly beloved, He has arisen and
helped us. For when he awaked (i.e. when He arose again, and became known to the Gentiles)
on the cessation of persecutions, even those who had cleaved to the earth were raised up
from the earth, and on performing penance,1361 have been restored to Christ’s body, feeble

and imperfect though they were: so that in them was fulfilled the text, “Thine eyes did see
my substance yet being imperfect; and in Thy book shall they all be written.”1362
“Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for Thy Name’s sake;” that is to say, freely; for
Thy Name’s sake, not for the sake of my merits: because Thou hast vouchsafed to do it, not
because I am worthy that Thou shouldest do it unto me. For this very thing, that “we have
not forgotten Thee;” that “our heart hath not gone back;” that we “have not stretched out
our hands to any strange god;” how should we have been able to achieve, except with Thy
help? How should we have strength for it, except through Thy appealing to us within, ex-
horting us, and not forsaking us? Whether then we suffer in tribulations, or rejoice in
prosperities, redeem Thou us, not for our merits, but for Thy Name’s sake.

Psalm XLIV
Psalm XLV.1363
1. This Psalm, even as we ourselves have been singing with gladness together with you,
we would beg you in like manner to consider with attention together with us. For it is sung
of the sacred Marriage-feast; of the Bridegroom and the Bride; of the King and His people;
of the Saviour and those who are to be saved.…His sons are we, in that we are the “children
of the Bridegroom;” and it is to us that this Psalm is addressed, whose title has the words,
“For the sons of Korah, for the things that1364 shall be changed.”
2. Why need I explain what is meant by, “for the things that shall be changed”? Every
one who is himself “changed,” recognises the meaning of this. Let him who hears this, “for
the things that shall be changed,” consider what was before, and what is now. And first let
him see the world itself to be changed, lately worshipping idols, now worshipping God;
lately serving things that they themselves made, now serving Him by whom they themselves
were made. Observe at what time the words, “for the things that shall be changed,” were
said. Already by this time the Pagans that are left are in dread of the “changed” state of
things: and those who will not suffer themselves to be “changed” see the churches full; the
temples deserted; see crowds here, and there solitude! They marvel at the things so changed;
let them read that they were foretold; let them lend their ears to Him who promised it; let
them believe Him who fulfils that promise. But each one of us, brethren, also undergoes a
change from “the old” to “the new man:” from an infidel to a believer: from a thief to a giver
of alms: from an adulterer to a man of chastity; from an evildoer to a doer of good. To us
then be sung the words, “for the things that shall be changed;” and so let the description of
Him by whom they were changed, begin.
3. For it goes on, “For the things that shall be changed, to the sons of Korah for under-
standing; a song for the beloved.” For that “beloved” One was seen by His persecutors, but
yet not for “understanding.” For “had they known Him, they would never have crucified
the Lord of Glory.”1365 In order to this “understanding,” other eyes were required by Him
when He said, “He that seeth Me, seeth My Father also.”1366 Let the Psalm then now sound
of Him, let us rejoice in the marriage-feast, and we shall be with those of whom the marriage
is made,1367 who are invited to the marriage; and the very persons invited are the Bride
herself. For the Church is “the Bride,” Christ the Bridegroom. There are commonly spoken
by balladists1368 certain verses to Bridegrooms and Brides, called Epithalamia.1369 Whatever

is sung there, is sung in honour of the Bride and Bridegroom. Is there then no Bridecham-
ber1370 in that marriage-feast to which we are invited? Whence then does another Psalm
say, “He hath set up His tabernacle in the Sun; and He is even as a bridegroom coming out
of his chamber.” The nuptial union is that of “the Word,” and the flesh. The Bridechamber
of this union, the Virgin’s womb. For the flesh itself was united to the Word: whence also
it is said, “Henceforth they are not twain, but one flesh.”1371 The Church was assumed unto
Him out of the human race: so that the Flesh itself, being united to the Word, might be the
Head of the Church: and the rest who believe, members of that Head.…
4. “Mine heart hath uttered a good word”1372 (ver. 1). Who is the speaker? The Father,
or the Prophet? For some understand it to be the Person of the Father, which says, “Mine
heart hath uttered a good word,” intimating to us a certain unspeakable generation.1373 Lest
you should haply think something to have been taken unto Him, out of which God should
beget the Son (just as man takes something to himself out of which he begets children, that
is to say, an union of marriage,1374 without which man cannot beget offspring), lest then
you should think that God stood in need of any nuptial union, to beget “the Son,” he says,
“Mine heart hath uttered a good word.”1375 This very day thine heart, O man, begets a
counsel, and requires no wife: by the counsel, so born of thine heart, thou buildest something
or other, and before that building subsists, the design subsists;1376 and that which thou art
about to produce, exists already in that by which thou art going to produce it; and thou
praisest the fabric that as yet is not existing, not yet in the visible form of a building, but on
the projecting of a design: nor does any one else praise thy design, unless either thou
showest it to him, or he sees what thou hast done. If then by the Word “all things were
made,”1377 and the Word is of God, consider the fabric reared by the Word, and learn from

the one substance of the Son, by eternal generation.—C.]

Psalm XLV
that building to admire His counsels! What manner of Word is that by which heaven and
earth were made;1378 and all the splendour of the heavens; all the fertility of the earth; the
expanse of the sea; the wide diffusion of air; the brightness of the constellations; the light of
sun and moon? These are visible things: rise above these also; think of the Angels, “Princip-
alities, Thrones, Dominions, and Powers.”1379 All were made by Him. How then were these
good things made? Because there was “uttered forth ‘a good Word,’” by which they were to
be made.…
5. It proceeds: “I speak of the things which I have made unto the King.” Is the Father
still speaking? If the Father is still speaking, let us enquire how this also can be understood
by us, consistently with the true Catholic Faith, “I speak of the things that I have made unto
the King.” For if it is the Father speaking of His own works to His Son, our “King,” what
works is the Father to speak of to the Son, seeing that all the Father’s works were made by
the Son’s agency? Or, in the words, “I speak of My works unto the King,” does the word, “I
speak,” itself signify the generation of the Son? I fear whether this can ever be made intelligible
to those slow of comprehension: I will nevertheless say it. Let those who can follow me, do
so: lest if it were left unsaid, even those who can follow should not be able. We have read
where it is said in another Psalm, “God hath spoken once.” 1380 So often has He spoken by
the Prophets, so often by the Apostles, and in these days by His Saints, and does He say,
“God has spoken once”? How can He have spoken but “once,” except with reference to His
“Word”?1381 But as the “Mine heart hath uttered a good Word,”1382 was understood by us
in the other clause of the generation of the Son, it seems that a kind of repetition is made
in the following sentence, so that the “Mine heart hath uttered a good Word,” which had
been already said, is repeated in what He is now saying, “I speak.” For what does “I speak”
mean? “I utter a Word.” And whence but from His heart, from His very inmost, does God
utter the Word? You yourself do not speak anything but what you bring forth from your
“heart,” this word of yours which sounds once and passes away, is brought forth from no
other place: and do you wonder that God “speaks” in this manner? But God’s “speaking” is
eternal. You are speaking something at the present moment, because you were silent before:
or, look you, you have not yet brought forth your word; but when you have begun to bring
it forth, you as it were “break silence;” and bring into being a word, that did not exist before.
It was not so God begat the “Word.” God’s “speaking” is without beginning, and without
end: and yet the “Word” He utters is but “One.” Let Him utter another, if what He has

1379 Col. i. 16.
1380 Ps. lxii. 11.
1381 Heb. i. 1, 2.
1382 Heb. i. 3, 4, 5.
Psalm XLV
spoken shall have passed away. But since He by whom it is uttered abideth, and That which
is uttered abideth; and is uttered but once, and has no end, that very “once” too is said
without beginning, and there is no second speaking, because that which is said once, does
not pass away. The words “Mine heart hath uttered a good Word,” then, are the same thing
with, “I speak of the things which I have made unto the King.” Why then, “I speak of the
things which I have made”? Because in the Word Itself are all the works of God. For whatever
God designed to make in the creation already existed in “the Word;” and would not exist
in the reality, had it not existed in the Word,1383 just as with you the thing would not exist
in the building, had it not existed in your design: even as it is said in the Gospel: “That which
was made in Him was life.”1384 That which was made then was in existence; but it had its
existence in the Word: and all the works of God existed there, and yet were not as yet “works.”
“The Word” however already was, as this “Word was God, and was with God:” and was the
Son of God, and One God with the Father. “I speak of the things I have made unto the King.”
Let him hear Him “speaking,” who apprehends “the Word:” and let him see together with
the Father the Everlasting Word; in whom exist even those things that are yet to come: in
whom even those things that are past have not passed away. These “works” of God are in
“the Word,” as in the Word, as in the Only-Begotten, as in the “Word of God.”
6. What follows then? “My tongue is the pen of a writer writing rapidly.” What likeness,
my brethren, what likeness, I ask, has the “tongue” of God with a transcriber’s pen? What
resemblance has “the rock” to Christ?1385 What likeness does the “lamb” bear to our Sa-
viour,1386 or what “the lion” to the strength of the Only-Begotten?1387 Yet such comparisons
have been made; and were they not made, we should not be formed to a certain extent by
these visible things to the knowledge of the “Invisible One.” So then with this mean simile
of the pen; let us not compare it to His excellent greatness, so let us not reject it with con-
tempt. For I ask, why He compares His “tongue” to “the pen of a writer writing rapidly”?
But how swiftly soever the transcriber writes, still it is not comparable to that swiftness of
which another Psalm says, “His word runneth very swiftly.”1388 But it appears to me (if
human understanding may presume so far) that this too may be understood as spoken in
the Person of the Father: “My tongue is the pen of a writer.” Inasmuch as what is spoken
by the “tongue,” sounds once and passes away, what is written, remains; seeing then that
God uttereth “a Word,” and the Word which is uttered does not sound once and pass away,

Psalm XLV
but is uttered and yet continues, God chose rather to compare this to words written than
to sounds. But what He added, saying, “of one writing swiftly,” stimulates the mind unto
“understanding.” Let it however not slothfully rest here, thinking of transcribers,1389 or
thinking of some kind of quick shorthand writers: if it be this it sees in the passage, it will
be resting there. Let it think swiftly what is the meaning of that word “swiftly.” The “swiftly”
of God is such that nothing exceeds in swiftness. For in writings letter is written after letter;
syllable after syllable; word after word: nor do we pass to the second except when the first
is written out. But there nothing can exceed the swiftness, where there are not several words;
and yet there is not anything omitted: since in the One are contained all things.
7. Lo! now then that Word, so uttered, Eternal, the Co-eternal Offspring of the Eternal,
will come as “the Bridegroom;” “Fairer than the children of men” (ver. 2). “Than the children
of men.” I ask, why not than the Angels also? Why did he say, “than the children of men,”
except because He was Man? Lest you should think “the Man Christ”1390 to be any ordinary
man, he says, “Fairer than the children of men.” Even though Himself “Man,” He is “fairer
than the children of men;” though among the children of men, “fairer than the children of
men:” though of the children of men, “fairer than the children of men.” “Grace is shed
abroad on Thy lips.” “The Law was given by Moses. Grace and Truth came by Jesus
Christ.”1391…
8. There have not been wanting those who preferred understanding all the preceding
passage also of the Prophet’s own person; and would have even this verse, “Mine heart hath
uttered forth a good word,” understood as spoken by the Prophet, supposed to be uttering
a hymn. For whoever utters a hymn to God, his heart is, as it were, “uttering forth a good
word,” just as his heart who blasphemes God, is uttering forth an evil word. So that even by
what follows, “I speak of the things which I have made1392 unto the King,” he meant to ex-
press that man’s chief work was but to praise God. To Him it belongs to satisfy thee, by His
beauty; to thee to praise Him with thanksgiving.…
9. “My tongue is the pen of a writer writing quickly.” There have been persons who have
understood the Prophet to have been describing in this manner what he was writing; and
therefore to have compared his tongue to “the pen of a writer writing quickly:” but that he
chose to express himself in the words “writing quickly,” to signify, that he was writing of
things which were to come “quickly;” that “writing quickly” should be understood to be
equivalent to “writing things that are quick;” i.e. writing things that would not long tarry.
For God did not tarry long to manifest Christ. How quickly is that perceived to have rolled

by, which is acknowledged to be already past! Call to mind the generations before thee; thou
wilt find that the making of Adam is but a thing of yesterday. So do we read that all things
have gone on from the very beginning:1393 they were therefore done “quickly.” The day of
Judgment also will be here “quickly.” Do thou anticipate its “quick” coming. It is to come
“quickly;” do thou become converted yet more “quickly.” The Judge’s face will appear: but
observe thou what the Prophet says, “Let us come before” (let us “prevent”) “His face with
confession.”1394
10. “Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most Mighty” (ver. 3). What is meant by “Thy
sword,” but “Thy word”? It was by that sword He scattered His enemies; by that sword he
divided the son from the father, “the daughter from the mother, the daughter-in-law from
the mother-in-law.” We read these words in the Gospel, “I came not to send peace, but a
sword.”1395 And, “In one house shall five be divided against each other; three against two,
and two against three;”1396 i.e. “the father against the son, the daughter against the mother,
the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.” By what “sword,” but that which Christ
brought, was this division wrought? And indeed, my brethren, we see this exemplified daily.
Some young man is minded to give himself up to God’s service; his father is opposed to it;
they are “divided against each other:” the one promises an earthly inheritance, the other
loves an heavenly; the one promises one thing, the other prefers another. The father should
not think himself wronged: God alone is preferred to him. And yet he is at strife1397 with
the son, who would fain give himself to God’s service. But the spiritual sword is mightier
to separate them, than the ties of carnal nature to bind them together. This happens also in
the case of a mother against her daughter; still more also in that of a daughter-in-law against
a mother-in-law. For sometimes in one house mother-in-law and daughter-in law are found
orthodox and heretical respectively. And where that sword is forcibly felt, 1398 we do not
dread the repetition of Baptism. Could daughter be divided against mother; and could not
daughter-in-law be divided against mother-in-law?…
11. What does he mean to express by the “thigh”? The flesh. Whence those words, “A
prince shall not depart from Judah; and a lawgiver from his thighs”?1399 Did not Abraham
himself (to whom was promised the seed in which “all the nations of the earth were to be

not to submit to heretical baptism. [On which compare Cyprian’s teaching, A.N.F. vol. v. pp. 376–385, etc.—C.]

Psalm XLV
blessed”), when he sent his servant to seek and to bring home a wife for his son, being by
faith fully persuaded, that in that, so to speak, contemptible seed was contained the great
Name;1400 that is, that the Son of God was to come of the seed of Abraham, out of all the
children of men; did not he, I say, cause his servant to swear unto him in this manner, saying,
“Put thy hand under my thigh,”1401 and so swear; as if he had said, “Put thy hand on the
altar, or on the Gospel, or on the Prophet, or on any holy thing.” “Put” (he says) “thy hand
under my thigh;” having full confidence, not ashamed of it as unseemly, but understanding
therein a truth. “With Thy beauty and Thy glory.” Take to Thee that righteousness, in which
Thou art at all times beautiful and glorious. “And speed on, and proceed prosperously, and
reign” (ver. 4). Do we not see it so? Is it not already come to pass? He has “sped on; has
proceeded prosperously, and He reigns;” all nations are subdued unto Him. What a thing
was it to see that “in the Spirit,” of which same thing it is now in our power to experience
in the reality! At the time when these words were said, Christ did not yet “reign” thus; had
not yet sped on, nor “proceeded prosperously.” They were then being preached, they have
now been fulfilled: in many things we have God’s promise fulfilled already; in some few we
have to claim its fulfilment yet.
12. “Because of truth, meekness, and righteousness.” Truth was restored unto us, when
“the Truth sprung out of the earth: and Righteousness looked out from heaven.”1402 Christ
was presented to the expectation of mankind, that in Abraham’s Seed “all nations should
be blessed.” The Gospel has been preached. It is “the Truth.” What is meant by “meekness”?
The Martyrs have suffered; and the kingdom of God has made much progress from thence,
and advanced throughout all nations; because the Martyrs suffered, and neither “fell away,”
nor yet offered resistance; confessing everything, concealing nothing; prepared for everything,
shrinking from nothing. Marvellous “meekness”! This did the body of Christ, by its Head
it learned. He was first “led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is
dumb, even so opened not His mouth;”1403 meek to that degree, that while hanging on the
Cross, He said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”1404 Why because
of “righteousness”? He will come also to judge, and to “render to every man according to
1400 “In illâ veluti humilitate seminis esse magnitudinem Nominis.” [The promise (Gen. iii. 15) dignified
the loins of Isaac (Gen. xvii. 19) as with the Incarnation in its germ. Hence this mysterious form of oath was an
oath by the Promised Seed (Gal. iii. 16). St. Paul quotes “the promises” (not one text only), and honours the
Septuagint, which gives what he makes so emphatic in Gen. xii. 7, xv. 18, and xxii. 18.—C.]

his works.” He spake “the truth;” He patiently endured unrighteousness: He is to bring
“righteousness” hereafter.
13. “And Thy right hand shall lead Thee on marvellously.” We shall be guided on by
His right hand: He by His own. For He is God, we mortal men. He was led on by His own
right hand; i.e. by His own power. For the power which the Father hath, He hath also; the
Father’s immortality He hath also; He hath the Father’s Divinity, the Father’s Eternity, the
Father’s Power.1405 Marvellously will His right hand lead Him on, performing the works
of God; undergoing human sufferings, overthrowing the evil wills1406 of men by His own
goodness. Even now, He is being led on even to places where as yet He is not; and it is His
own right hand that is leading Him on. For that is leading Him thither which He has Himself
bestowed upon His Saints. “Thy right hand shall lead Thee on marvellously.”
14. “Thine arrows are sharp, are most powerful” (ver. 5); words that pierce the heart,
that kindle love. Whence in the Song of Songs it is said, “I am wounded with love.”1407 For
she speaks of being “wounded with love;” that is, of being in love, of being inflamed with
passion, of sighing for the Bridegroom, from whom she received the arrow of the Word.
“Thine arrows are sharp, are most powerful;” both piercing, and effective; “sharp, most
powerful.” “The peoples shall fall under Thee.” Who have “fallen”? They who were “wounded”
have also “fallen.” We see the nations subdued unto Christ; we do not see them “fall.” He
explains where they “fall,” viz. “in the heart.” It was there they lifted themselves up against
Christ, there they “fall” down before Christ. Saul was a blasphemer of Christ: he was then
lifted up, he prays to Christ, “he is fallen,” he is prostrate before Him: the enemy of Christ
is slain, that the disciple of Christ may live! By an arrow launched from heaven, Saul (not
as yet Paul, but still Saul), still lifted up, still not yet prostrate, is wounded in “the heart:” he
received the arrow, he fell “in heart.” For though he fell prostrate on his face, it was not there
that he fell down in heart:1408 but it was there where he said aloud, “Lord, what dost Thou
bid me do?”1409 But just now thou wert going to bind the Christians, and to bring them to
punishment: and now thou sayest unto Christ, “What dost Thou bid me do?” O arrow sharp
and most mighty, by whose stroke “Saul” fell, so as to become “Paul.” As it was with him,
so was it also with “the peoples;” consider the nations, observe their subjection unto Christ.
“The peoples” (then) “shall fall under Thee in the heart of the King’s enemies;” that is, in
the heart of Thine enemies. For it is Him that he calls King, Him that he recognises as King.
“The peoples shall fall under Thee in the heart of the King’s enemies.” They were “enemies”

before; they have been stricken by thine arrows: they have fallen before Thee. Out of enemies
they have been made friends: the enemies are dead, the friends survive. This is the meaning
of, “for those which shall be changed.” We are seeking to “understand” each single word,
and each separate verse; yet so far only are we to seek for their “understanding,” as to leave
no one to doubt that they are spoken of Christ.
15. “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever” (ver. 6). Because God has “‘blessed Thee’
for ever,” on account of the “grace poured over Thy lips.” Now the throne of the Jewish
Kingdom was a temporal one; belonging to those who were under the Law, not to those
who were under “grace:” He came to “redeem those who were under the Law,” and to place
them under “Grace.” His “Throne is for ever and ever.” Why? for that first throne of the
Kingdom was but a temporal one: whence then have we a “throne for ever and ever”? Because
it is God’s throne. O divine Attribute of Eternity!1410 for God could not have a temporal
throne. “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever—a sceptre of direction is the sceptre of
Thy Kingdom.” “The sceptre of direction” is that which directs mankind: they were before
crooked, distorted; they sought to reign for themselves: they loved themselves, loved their
own evil deeds: they submitted not their own will to God; but would fain have bent God’s
will to conformity with their own lusts. For the sinner and the unrighteous man is generally
angry with God, because it rains not!1411 and yet would have God not be angry with himself,
because he is profligate.1412 And it is pretty much for this very reason that men daily sit, to
dispute against God: “This is what He ought to have done: this He has not well done.” Thou
forsooth seest what thou doest; He knows not what He does! It is thou that art crooked! His
ways are right. When wilt thou make the crooked coincide with the straight? It cannot be
made to coincide with it.1413 Just as if you were to place a crooked stick on a level pavement;
it does not join on to it; it does not cohere; it does not fit into the pavement. The pavement
is even in every part: but that is crooked; it does not fit into that which is level. The will of
God then is “equal,” thine own is “crooked:” it is because thou canst not be conformed unto
it, that it seems “crooked” unto thee: rule thou thyself by it; seek not to bend it to thine own
will: for thou canst not accomplish it; that is at all times “straight”! Wouldest thou abide in
Him? “Correct thou thyself;” so will the sceptre of Him who rules thee, be unto thee “a rule
of direction.” Thence is He also called King,1414 from “ruling.” For that is no “ruler” that

does not correct.1415 Hereunto is our King a King of “right ones.”1416 Just as He is a Priest
(Sacerdos) by sanctifying us, so is He our King, our Ruler, by “ruling” us.…
16. “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity” (ver. 7). See there “the rod of
direction” described. “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity.” Draw near to
that “rod;” let Christ be thy King: let Him “rule” thee with that rod, not crush thee with it.
For that rod is “a rod of iron;” an inflexible rod.1417 “Thou shalt rule them with a rod of
iron: and break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”1418 Some He rules; others He “breaks
in pieces:” He “rules” them that are spiritual: He “breaks in pieces” them that are car-
nal.…Would He so loudly declare that He was about to smite thee, if He wished to smite
thee? He is then holding back His hand from the punishment of thine offences; but do not
thou hold back. Turn thou thyself to the punishment of thine offences: for unpunished of-
fences cannot be: punishment therefore must be executed either by thyself, or by Him: do
thou then plead guilty, that He may reprieve thee. Consider an instance in that penitential
Psalm: “Hide Thy face from my sins.”1419 Did he mean “from me”? No: for in another passage
he says plainly, “Hide not Thy face from me.” “Turn” then “Thy face from my sins.” I would
have Thee not see my sins. For God’s “seeing” is animadverting upon. Hence too a Judge is
said to “animadvert”1420 on that which he punishes; i.e. to turn his mind on it, to bend it
thereon, even to the punishment of it, inasmuch as he is the Judge. So too is God a Judge.
“Turn Thou Thy face from my sins.” But thou thyself, if thou wouldest have God turn “His
face” from them, turn not thine own face from them. Observe how he proposes this to God
in that very Psalm: “I acknowledge,” he says, “my transgression, and my sin is ever before
me.” 1421 He would fain have that which he wishes to be ever before his own eyes, not be
before God’s eyes. Let no one flatter himself with fond hopes of God’s mercy. His sceptre
is “a sceptre of righteousness.” Do we say that God is not merciful? What can exceed His
mercy, who shows such forbearance to sinners; who takes no account of the past in all that
turn unto Him? So love thou Him for His mercy, as still to wish that He should be truthful.

17. “Therefore, God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee.” It was for this reason that He
anointed thee, that thou mightest love righteousness, and hate iniquity. And observe in what
way he expresses himself. “Therefore, God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee:” i.e. “God hath
anointed Thee, O God.” “God” is “anointed” by God. For in the Latin it is thought to be the
same case of the noun repeated: in the Greek however there is a most evident distinction;
one being the name of the Person addressed; and one His who makes the address, saying,
“God hath anointed Thee.” “O God, Thy God hath anointed Thee,” just as if He were saying,
“Therefore hath Thy God, O God, anointed Thee.” Take it in that sense, understand it in
that sense; that such is the sense is most evident in the Greek. Who then is the God that is
“anointed” by God? Let the Jews tell us; these Scriptures are common to us and them. It was
God, who was anointed by God: you hear of an “Anointed” one; understand it to mean
“Christ.” For the name of “Christ” comes from “chrism;” this name by which He is called
“Christ” expresses “unction:” nor were kings and prophets anointed in any kingdom, in any
other place, save in that kingdom where Christ was prophesied of, where He was anointed,
and from whence the Name of Christ was to come. It is found nowhere else at all: in no one
nation or kingdom. God, then, was anointed by God; with what oil was He anointed, but a
spiritual one? For the visible oil is in the sign, the invisible oil is in the mystery;1422 the
spiritual oil is within. “God” then was “anointed” for us, and sent unto us; and God Himself
was man, in order that He might be “anointed:” but He was man in such a way as to be God
still. He was God in such a way as not to disdain to be man. “Very man and very God;” in
nothing deceitful, in nothing false, as being everywhere true, everywhere “the Truth” itself.
God then is man; and it was for this cause that “God” was “anointed,” because God was
Man, and became “Christ.”
18. This was figured in Jacob’s placing a stone at his head, and so sleeping.1423 The
patriarch Jacob had placed a stone at his head: sleeping with that stone at his head, he saw
heaven opened, and a ladder from heaven to earth, and Angels ascending and descending;1424
after this vision he awaked, anointed the stone, and departed. In that “stone” he understood
Christ; for that reason he anointed it. Take notice what it is whereby Christ is preached.
What is the meaning of that anointing of a stone, especially in the case of the Patriarchs
who worshipped but One God? It was however done as a figurative act: and he departed.
For he did not anoint the stone, and come to worship there constantly, and to perform
1422 Al. “The visible oil is for a sign of the oil invisible, for it is in a sacrament.” [The use of oil in confirmation,
designed to teach this, operated to conceal it rather; the material chrism absorbing the spiritual idea.—C.]

1424 [With which he subjoins a reference to John i. 51.—C.]
Psalm XLV
sacrifice there. It was the expression of a mystery; not the commencement of sacrilege. And
notice the meaning of “the stone.” “The Stone which the builders refused, this is become
the head of the corner.”1425 Notice here a great mystery. The “Stone” is Christ. Peter calls
Him “a living Stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God.”1426 And the stone is
set at “the head,” because “Christ is the Head of the man.”1427 And “the stone” was anointed,
because “Christ” was so called from His being anointed. And in the revelation of Christ, the
ladder from earth to heaven is seen, or from heaven to earth, and the Angels ascending and
descending. What this means, we shall see more clearly, when we have quoted the testimony
from the Lord Himself in the Gospel. You know that Jacob is the same as Israel. For when
he wrestled with the Angel, and “prevailed,” and had been blest by Him over whom he
prevailed, his named was changed, so that he was called “Israel;” just as the people of Israel
“prevailed”1428 against Christ, so as to crucify Him, and nevertheless was (in those who
believed in Christ) blest by Him over whom it prevailed. But many believed not; hence the
halting of Jacob. Here we have at once, blessing and halting. Blessing on those who became
believers; for we know that afterward many of that people did believe: Halting on the other
hand in those who believed not. And because the greater part believed not, and but few be-
lieved, therefore that a halting might be produced, He touched “the breadth1429 of his
thigh.”1430 What is meant by the breadth of the thigh? The great multitude of his descend-
ants.1431…
19. “God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee.” We have been speaking of God, who was
“anointed;” i.e. of Christ. The name of Christ could not be more clearly expressed than by
His being called “God the Anointed.” In the same way in which He was “beautiful before
the children of men,” so is He here “anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows.”
Who then are His “fellows”? The children of men; for that He Himself (as the Son of Man)
became partaker of their mortality in order to make them partakers of His Immortality.
20. “Out of Thy garments is the smell of myrrh, amber, and cassia” (ver. 8). Out of Thy
garments is perceived the smell of fragrant odours. By His garments are meant His Saints,
His elect, His whole Church, which he shows forth, as His garment, so to speak; His robe
“without spot and wrinkle,”1432 which on account of its spots He has “washed” in His blood;

on account of its “wrinkles” extended on His Cross. Hence the sweet savour which is signified
by certain perfumes there mentioned. Hear Paul, that “least of the Apostles” (that “hem of
that garment,” which the woman with the issue of blood touched, and was healed), hear
him saying: “We are a sweet savour of Christ, in every place, both in them that are saved,
and in them that perish.” 1433 He did not say, “We are a sweet savour in them that are saved,
and a foul savour in them that are lost:” but, as far as relates to ourselves, “we are a sweet
savour both in them that are saved, and in them that perish.”…They who loved him were
saved by the odour of “sweet savour;” they who envied him, perished by means of that “sweet
savour.” To them that perished then he was not a foul “savour,” but a “sweet savour.” For
it was for this very reason they the more envied him, the more excellent that grace was which
reigned in him: for no man envies him who is unhappy. He then was glorious in the
preaching of God’s Word, and in regulating his life according to the rule of that “rod of
direction;” and he was loved by those who loved Christ in him, who followed after and
pursued the odour of sweet savour; who loved the friend of the bridegroom: that is to say,
by the Bride Herself, who says in the Song of Songs, 1434 “We will run after the sweet savour
of thy perfumes.” But the others, the more they beheld him invested with the glory of the
preaching of the Gospel, and of an irreproachable life, were so much the more tortured with
envy, and found that sweet savour prove death to them.
21. “Out of thy ivory palaces, whereby kings’ daughters have made Thee glad.” Choose
whichever you please, “ivory” palaces, or “magnificent,” or “royal” palaces, it is out of these
that the kings’ daughters have made Christ glad. Would you understand the spiritual sense
of “ivory palaces”? Understand by them the magnificent houses, and tabernacles of God,
the hearts of the Saints; and by these self-same “kings” those who rule their flesh; who bring
into subjection to themselves the rebellious commonalty of human affections, who chastise
the body, and reduce it to bondage: for it is from these that the daughters of kings have
made Him glad. For all the souls that have been born through their preaching and evangel-
izing are “daughters of kings:” and the Churches, as the daughters of Apostles, are daughters
of kings. For He is “King of kings;” they themselves kings, of whom it was said, “Ye shall sit
upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”1435 They preached the “Word of
Truth;” and begat Churches not for themselves, but for Him.…Therefore as “raising up
seed1436 to their brother,” to as many as they begat, they gave the name not of “Paulians”
or “Petrians,” but of “Christians.” Observe whether that sense is not wakefully kept1437 in
1433 2 Cor. ii. 14, 15.

1435 Matt. xix. 28.
1436 Oxf. mss. add, “For the Brother’s name’s sake.”
1437 Vigilat.
Psalm XLV
these verses. For when he said, “out of the ivory palaces, he spake of mansions royal, ample,
honourable, peaceful, like the heart of the Saints; he added, “Whereby the kings’ daughters
have made Thee glad in Thine honour.” They are indeed daughters of kings, daughters of
thine Apostles, but still “in Thine honour:” for they raised up seed to their brother. Hence
Paul, when he saw those whom he had raised up unto his Brother, running after his own
name, exclaimed, “Was Paul crucified for you?”1438…No; for he says, “Or were ye baptized
in the name of Paul?”
“The daughters of kings have made Thee glad in Thine honour.” Keep, hold fast this
“in Thine honour.” This is meant by having “a wedding garment;” seeking His honour, His
glory. Understand moreover by “kings’ daughters” the cities, which were founded by kings,
and have received the faith: and out of the ivory palaces (palaces rich, the proud, the lifted
up). “Kings’ daughters have made Thee glad in Thine honour;” in that they sought not the
honour of their founders, but have sought Thine honour. Show me at Rome a temple of
Romulus held in so great honour as I can show you the Monument of Peter.1439 In Peter,
who is honoured but He who died for us? For we are followers of Christ, not followers of
Peter. And even if we were born from the brother of Him that is dead, yet are we named
after the name of Him who is dead.1440 We were begotten by the one, but begotten to the
other. Behold, Rome, Carthage, and several other cities are the daughters of kings, and yet
have they “made glad the King in His honour:” and all these make up one single Queen.
22. What a nuptial song! Behold in the midst of songs full of rejoicing, comes forth the
Bride herself. For the Bridegroom was coming. It was He who was being described: it was
on Him all our attention was fixed.
“Upon Thy right hand did stand the Queen” (ver. 9). She which stands on the left is no
Queen. For there will be one standing on “the left” also, to whom it will be said, “Go into
everlasting fire.”1441 But she shall stand on the right hand, to whom it will be said, “Come,
ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world.”1442 On Thy right hand did stand the Queen, “in a vesture of gold, clothed about
with divers colours.” What is the vesture of this Queen? It is one both precious, and also of
divers colours: it is the mysteries of doctrine in all the various tongues: one African, one
Syrian, one Greek, one Hebrew, one this, and one that; it is these languages that produce
the divers colours of this vesture.1443 But just as all the divers colours of the vesture blend

together in the one vesture, so do all the languages in one and the same faith. In that vesture,
let there be diversity, let there be no rent. See we have “understood” the divers colours of
the diversity of tongues; and the vesture to refer to unity: but in that diversity itself, what is
meant by the “gold”? Wisdom itself. Let there be any diversity of tongues you please, but
there is but one “gold” that is preached of: not a different gold, but a different form of that
gold. For it is the same Wisdom, the same doctrine and discipline that every language
preaches. In the languages there is diversity; gold in the thoughts.
23. The Prophet addresses this Queen (for he delights in singing to her), and moreover
each one of us, provided, however, we know where we are, and endeavour to belong to that
body, and do belong to it in faith and hope, being united in the membership of Christ.1444
For it is us whom he addresses, saying, “Hearken, O daughter, and behold” (ver. 10), as being
one of the “Fathers” (for they are “daughters of kings”), although it be a Prophet, or although
it be an Apostle1445 that is addressing her; addressing her, as a daughter, for we are accus-
tomed to speak in this way, “Our fathers the Prophets, our fathers the Apostles;” if we address
them as “fathers,” they may address us as children: and it is one father’s voice addressing
one daughter. “Hearken, O daughter, and see.” “Hear” first; afterward “see.” For they came
to us with the Gospel; and that has been preached to us, which as yet we do not see, and
which on hearing of it we believed, which by believing it, we shall come to see: even as the
Bridegroom Himself speaks in the Prophet, “A people whom I have not known served me.
In the hearing of me with the ear it obeyed me.”1446 What is meant by on “hearing of me
with the ear”? That they did not “see.” The Jews saw Him, and crucified Him; the Gentiles
saw Him not, and believed. Let the Queen who comes from the Gentiles come in “the vesture
of gold, clothed with divers colours;”1447 let her come from among the Gentiles clad in all
languages, in the unity of Wisdom: let it be said unto her, “Hearken, O daughter, and see.”
If thou wilt not hear, thou shalt not “see.”…
“And incline thine ear.” It is not enough to “hearken;” hearken with humility: bow down
thine ear. “Forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house.” There was a certain “people,”
and a certain house of thy father, in which thou wast born, the people of Babylon, having
the devil for thy king. Whencesoever the Gentiles came, they came from their father the
devil; but they have renounced their sonship to the devil. “Forget also thine own people,
and thy father’s house.” He, in making thee a sinner, begat thee loathsome: the Other, in
that “He justifies the ungodly,”1448 begetteth thee again in beauty.

24. “For the King hath greatly desired thy beauty” (ver. 11). What “beauty” is that, save
that which is His own work? “Greatly desired the beauty”—Of whom? Of her the sinner,
the unrighteous, the ungodly, such as she was with her “father,” the devil, and among her
own “people”? No, but hers of whom it is said, “Who is this that cometh up made white?”1449
She was not white then at the first, but was “made” white afterwards. For “though your sins
shall be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.”1450 “The king has greatly desired thy
beauty.” What King is this? “For He is the Lord thy God.”1451 Now consider whether thou
oughtest not to forego that thy father, and thy own people, and to come to this King, who
is thy God? Thy God is “thy King,” thy “King” is also thy Bridegroom. Thou weddest to thy
King, who is thy God: being endowed by Him, being adorned by Him; redeemed by Him,
and healed by Him. Whatever thou hast, wherewith to be pleasing to Him, thou hast from
Him.
25. “And the daughters of Tyre shall worship Him with gifts” (ver. 12). It is that selfsame
“King, who is thy God,” that the daughters of Tyre shall worship with gifts. The daughters
of Tyre are the daughters of the Gentiles; the part standing for the whole. Tyre, a city bor-
dering on this country, where the prophecy was delivered, typified the nations that were to
believe in Christ. Thence came that Canaanitish woman, who was at first called “a dog;” for
that ye may know that she was from thence, the Gospel speaks thus. “He departed into the
parts of Tyre and Sidon, and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,” with
all the rest that is related there. She who at first, at the house of her “father,” and among her
“own people,” was but “a dog,” who by coming to, and crying after that “King,” was made
beautiful by believing in Him, what did she obtain to hear? “O woman, great is thy faith.”1452
“The King has greatly desired thy beauty. And the daughters of Tyre shall worship with
gifts.”1453 With what gifts? Even so would this King be approached, and would have His
treasuries filled: and it is He Himself who has given us that wherewith they may be filled,
and may be filled1454 by you. Let them come (He says) and “worship Him with gifts.” What
is meant by “with gifts”?…“Give alms, and all things are clean unto you.” Come with gifts
to Him that saith, “I will have mercy rather than sacrifice.”1455 To that Temple that existed

aforetime as a shadow of that which was to come, they used to come with bulls, and rams,
and goats, with every different kind of animal for sacrifice: that with that blood one thing
should be done, and another be typified by it. Now that very blood, which all these things
used to figure, hath come: the King Himself hath come, and He Himself would have your
“gifts.” What gifts? Alms. For He Himself will judge hereafter, and will Himself hereafter
account “gifts” to certain persons. “Come” (He says), “ye blessed of My Father.” Why? “I
was an hungred, and ye gave Me meat,”1456 etc. These are the gifts with which the daughters
of Tyre worship the King; for when they said, “When saw we Thee?” He who is at once
above and below (whence those “ascending” and “descending” are spoken of 1457), said,
“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of Mine, ye have done it unto Me.”1458
26. …“The rich among the people shall entreat Thy face.” Both they who shall entreat
that face, and He whose face they will entreat, are all collectively but one Bride, but one
Queen, mother and children belonging all together unto Christ, belonging unto their Head.…
27. “All the glory of her, the King’s daughter, is from within” (ver. 13). Not only is her
robe, outwardly, “of gold, and of divers colours;” but He who loved her beauty, knew her
to be also beautiful within.1459 What are those inward charms?1460 Those of conscience. It
is there Christ sees; it is there Christ loves her: it is there He addresses her, there punishes,
there crowns. Let then thine alms be done in secret; for “all the glory of her, the King’s
daughter, is from within.” “With fringes of gold, clothed with divers colours” (ver. 14). Her
beauty is from within; yet in the “fringes of gold” is the diversity of languages: the beauty
of doctrine. What do these avail, if them be not that beauty “from within”? “The virgins
shall be brought unto the King after her.” It has been fulfilled indeed. The Church has be-
lieved; the Church has been formed throughout all nations. And to what a degree do virgins
now seek to find favour in the eyes of that King! Whence are they moved to do so? Even
because the Church preceded them. “The virgins shall be brought unto the King after her.
Her near kinswomen 1461 shall be brought unto Thee.” For they that are brought unto Him
are not strangers, but her “near kinswomen,” that belong to her. And because he had said,
“unto the King,” he says, turning the discourse to Him, “her near kinswomen shall be brought
unto Thee.”

28. “With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought and shall be led into the Temple
of the King” (ver. 15). The “Temple of the King” is the Church itself: it is the Church itself
that enters into “the Temple of the King.” Whereof is that Temple constructed? Of the men
who enter the Temple? Who but God’s “faithful” ones are its “living stones”?1462 “They
shall be led into the Temple of the King.” For there are virgins without the Temple of the
King, the nuns among the heretics:1463 they are virgins, it is true; but what will that profit
them, unless they be led into the “Temple of the King”? The “Temple of the King” is in unity:
the “Temple of the King” is not ruinous, is not rent asunder, is not divided. The cement1464
of those living stones is “charity.”
29. “Instead of thy fathers, children are born to thee” (ver. 16). Nothing can be more
manifest. Now consider the “Temple of the King” itself, for it is on its behalf he speaks, on
account of the unity of the body that is spread throughout all the world: for those very persons
who have chosen to be virgins, cannot find favour with the King unless they be led into the
Temple of the King. “Instead of thy fathers, are thy children born to thee.” It was the Apostles
begat thee: they were “sent:” they were the preachers: they are “the fathers.” But was it possible
for them to be with us in the body for ever? Although one of them said, “I desire to depart,
and to be with Christ, which is far better: to abide in the flesh is necessary for your sakes.”
It is true he said this, but how long was it possible for him to remain here? Could it be till
this present time, could it be to all futurity? Is the Church then left desolate by their depar-
ture? God forbid. “Instead of thy fathers, children have been born to thee.” What is that?
The Apostles were sent to thee as “fathers,” instead of the Apostles sons have been born to
thee: there have been appointed Bishops. For in the present day, whence do the Bishops,
throughout all the world, derive their origin? The Church itself calls them fathers; the Church
itself brought them forth, and placed them on the thrones of “the fathers.” Think not thyself
abandoned then, because thou seest not Peter, nor seest Paul: seest not those through whom
thou wert born. Out of thine own offspring has a body of “fathers” been raised up to thee.
“Instead of thy fathers, have children been born to thee.” Observe how widely diffused is
the “Temple of the King,” that “the virgins that are not led to the Temple of the King,” may
know that they have nothing to do with that marriage. “Thou shalt make them princes1465
over all the earth.” This is the Universal Church: her children have been made “princes over
all the earth:” her children have been appointed instead of the “fathers.” Let those who are
cut off own the truth of this, let them come to the One Body: let them be led into the Temple
of the King. God hath established His Temple everywhere: hath laid everywhere “the
1462 1 Pet. ii. 4.
1463 Hæreticæ sanctimoniales.
1464 Junctura.
1465 [Not worldly princes, but spiritual chiefs and leaders of the flock.—C.]
Psalm XLV
foundations of the Prophets and Apostles.”1466 The Church has brought “forth sons;” has
made them “instead of her fathers” to be “princes over all the earth.”
30. “They shall be mindful of thy name in every generation and generation; therefore
shall the peoples confess unto1467 Thee” (ver. 17). What does it profit then to “confess” indeed
and yet to confess out of “the Temple”? What does it profit to pray, and yet not to pray on
the Mount? “I cried,” says he, “unto the Lord with my voice: and He heard me out of His
holy hill.”1468 Out of what “hill”? Out of that of which it is said, “A city set upon a hill cannot
be hid.”1469 Of what “hill”? Out of that hill which Daniel saw “grow out of a small stone,
and break all the kingdoms of the earth; and cover all the face of the earth.”1470 There let
him pray, who hopes to receive: there let him ask, who would have his prayer heard: there
let him confess, who wishes to be pardoned. “Therefore shall the peoples confess unto thee
for ever, world without end.” For in that eternal life it is true indeed there will no longer be
the mourning over sins: but yet in the praises of God by that everlasting City which is above,
there will not be wanting a perpetual confession of the greatness of that happiness. For to
that City itself, to which another Psalm1471 sings, “Glorious things are spoken of thee, O
City of God,” to her who is the very Bride of Christ, the very Queen, a “King’s daughter,
and a King’s consort;”…the peoples shall for this very cause confess even to herself; the
hearts of all, now enlightened by perfect charity, being laid bare, and made manifest, that
she may know the whole of herself most completely, who here is, in many parts of her, un-
known to herself.…

Psalm XLVI.1472
1. It is called, “A Psalm, to the end, for the sons of Korah, for things secret.” Secret is it
then; but He Himself, who in the place of Calvary was crucified, ye know, hath rent the
veil,1473 that the secrets of the temple might be discovered. Furthermore since the Cross of
our Lord was a key, whereby things closed might be opened; let us trust that He will be with
us, that these secrets may be revealed. What is said, “To the end,” always ought to be under-
stood of Christ. For “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that be-
lieveth.”1474 But The End He is called, not because He consumeth, but because He perfecteth.
For ended call we the food which is eaten, and ended the coat which is woven, the former
to consumption, the latter to perfection. Because then we have not where to go farther when
we have come to Christ, Himself is called the end of our course. Nor ought we to think, that
when we have come to Him, we ought to strive any further to come also to the Father. For
this thought Philip also, when he said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth
us.” When he said, “It sufficeth us,” he sought the end of satisfaction and perfection. Then
said He, “Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not known Me, Philip: he that
hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.”1475 In Him then have we the Father, because He is in
the Father, and the Father in Him, and He and His Father are One.1476
2. “Our God is a refuge and strength” (ver. 1). There are some refuges wherein is no
strength, whereto when any fleeth, he is more weakened than strengthened. Thou fleest, for
example, to some one greater in the world, that thou mayest make thyself a powerful friend;
this seemeth to thee a refuge. Yet so great are this world’s uncertainties, and so frequent
grow the ruins of the powerful day by day, that when to such refuge thou art come, thou
beginnest to fear more than ever therein.…Our refuge is not such, but our refuge is strength.
When thither we have fled, we shall be firm.
3. “A helper in tribulations, which find us out too much.” Tribulations are many, and
in every tribulation unto God must we flee; whether it be a tribulation in our estate, or in
our body’s health, or about the peril of those dearest to us, or any other thing necessary to
1472 Lat. XLV. [In his exordium the Saint recurs to his favourite idea as follows: “Korah is interpreted
‘Baldness,’ and that our Lord, since in the ‘place of the Bald skull’ [Matt. xxvii. 33] He was crucified, hath drawn
unto Him many; like that corn of wheat, which except it die, should abide alone; and that those who are drawn
unto Him are called sons of Korah [John xii. 24, 32]. Thus much in the mystery. There were indeed some sons
of Korah at the time when this was first sung [1 Chron. xxvi. 1], but to us ought the Spirit to give life, not the
letter to be a veil” [2 Cor. iii. 6.]—C.]

Psalm XLVI
the sustaining of this life, refuge ought there to be none at all to a Christian man, other than
his Saviour, other than his God, to whom when he has fled, he is strong. For he will not in
himself be strong, nor will he to himself be strength, but He will be his strength, who has
become his refuge. But, dearly beloved, among all tribulations of the human soul is no
greater tribulation than the consciousness of sin. For if there be no wound herein, and that
be sound within man which is called conscience, wherever else he may suffer tribulation,
thither will he flee, and there find God.…Ye see, dearly beloved, when trees are cut down
and proved by the carpenters, sometimes in the surface they seem as though injured and
rotten; but the carpenter looks into the inner marrow as it were of the tree, and if within he
find the wood sound, he promises that it will last in a building; nor will he be very anxious
about the injured surface, when that which is within he declares sound. Furthermore, to
man anything more inward than conscience is not found; what then profits it, if what is
without is sound, and the marrow of conscience has become rotton? These are close and
vehement overmuch, and as this Psalm saith, too great tribulations; yet even in these the
Lord hath become a helper by forgiving sin. For the consciences of the ungodly hateth
nothing save indulgence; for if one saith he hath great tribulations, being a confessed debtor
to the treasury, when he beholdeth the narrowness of his estate, and seeth that he cannot
be solvent; if on account of the distrainers every year hanging over him, he saith that he
suffereth great tribulations, and doth not breathe freely except in hope of indulgence, and
that in things earthly;1477 how much more the debtor of penalties out of the abundance of
sins: when shall he pay what he owes out of his evil conscience, when if he pay, he perisheth?
For to pay this debt, is to undergo the penalties. Remaineth then that of His indulgence, we
may be secure, yet so that, indulgence received, we return not again to contract debts.…
4. Now then, such security received, what say they? “Therefore will not we fear, when
the earth shall be confounded” (ver. 2). Just before anxious, suddenly secure; out of too great
tribulations set in great tranquillity. For in them Christ was sleeping, therefore were they
tossed: Christ awoke (as but now we heard out of the Gospel), He commanded the winds,
and they were still.1478 Since Christ is in each man’s heart by faith, it is signified to us, that
his heart as a ship in this world’s tempest is tossed, who forgetteth his faith: as though Christ
sleeping it is tossed, but Christ awaking cometh tranquillity. Nay, the Lord Himself, what
said He? “Where is your faith?”1479 Christ aroused, aroused up faith, that what had been
done in the ship, might be done in their hearts. “A helper in tribulations, which found us1480
out too much.” He caused that therein should be great tranquillity.

5. See what tranquillity: “Therefore will not we fear when the earth shall be confounded,
and the mountains shall be carried into the heart of the sea.” Then we shall find not fear.
Let us seek mountains carried, and if we can find, it is manifest that this is our security. The
Lord truly said to His disciples, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to
this mountain, Be Thou removed, and be Thou cast into the sea, and it shall be done.” 1481
Haply “to this mountain,” He said of Himself; for He is called a Mountain: “It shall come
to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest.”1482 But this
Mountain is placed above other mountains; because the Apostles also are mountains, sup-
porting this Mountain. Therefore followeth, “In the last days the Mountain of the Lord shall
be manifest, established in the top of the mountains.” Therefore passeth It the tops of all
mountains, and on the top of all mountains is It placed; because the mountains are preaching
The Mountain. But the sea signifieth this world, in comparison of which sea, like earth
seemed the nation of the Jews. For it was not covered over with the bitterness of idolatry,
but, like dry land, was surrounded with the bitterness of the Gentiles as with sea. It was to
be, that the earth be confounded, that is, that nation of the Jews; and that the mountains be
carried into the heart of the sea, that is, first that great Mountain established in the top of
the mountains. For He deserted the nation of the Jews, and came among the Gentiles. He
was carried from the earth into the sea. Who carrying Him? The Apostles, to whom He had
said, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou re-
moved, and be thou cast into the sea, and it shall be done:” that is, through your most
faithful preaching it shall come to pass, that this mountain, that is, I Myself, be preached
among the Gentiles, be glorified among the Gentiles, be acknowledged among the Gentiles,
and that be fulfilled which was predicted of Me, “A people whom I have not known shall
serve Me.”1483…
6. “The waters thereof roared, and were troubled” (ver. 3): when the Gospel was preached,
“What is this? He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods:”1484 this the Athenians; but
the Ephesians, with what tumult would they have slain the Apostles, when in the theatre,
for their goddess Diana, they made such an uproar, as to be shouting, “Great is Diana of
the Ephesians!”1485 Amidst which waves and roaring of the sea, feared not they who to that
refuge had fled. Nay, the Apostle Paul would enter in to the theatre, and was kept back by
the disciples, because it was necessary that he should still abide in the flesh for their sakes.
But yet, “the waters thereof roared, and were troubled: the mountains shook at the mightiness
1481 Matt. xvii. 20, xxi. 21.

thereof.” Whose might? The sea’s? or rather God’s, of whom was said, “refuge and strength,
a helper in tribulations, which have found us out too much?” For shaken were the mountains,
that is, the powers of this world. For one thing are the mountains of God, another the
mountains of the world: the mountains of the world, they whose head is the devil, the
mountains of God, they whose Head is Christ. But by these mountains were shaken those
mountains. Then gave they their voices against Christians, when the mountains were shaken,
the waters roaring; for the mountains were shaken, and there was made a great earthquake,
with quaking of the sea. But against whom this? Against the City founded upon a rock. The
waters roar, the mountains shake, the Gospel being preached. What then, the City of God?
Hear what followeth.
7. “The streams of the river make glad the City of God” (ver. 4). When the mountains
shake, when the sea rages, God deserteth not His City, by the streams of the river. What are
these streams of the river? That overflowing of the Holy Spirit, of which the Lord said, “If
any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, out of his bos-
om1486 shall flow rivers of living water.”1487 These rivers then flowed out of the bosom1488
of Paul, Peter, John, the other Apostles, the other faithful Evangelists. Since these rivers
flowed from one river, many “streams of the river make glad the City of God.” For that ye
might know this to be said of the Holy Spirit, in the same Gospel next said the Evangelist,
“But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that were to believe on Him should receive. For
the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.” 1489 Jesus being
glorified after His Resurrection, glorified after His Ascension, on the day of Pentecost came
the Holy Spirit, and filled the believers,1490 who spake with tongues, and began to preach
the Gospel to the Gentiles. Hence was the City of God made glad, while the sea was troubled
by the roaring of its waters, while the mountains were confounded, asking what they should
do, how drive out the new doctrine, how root out the race of Christians from the earth.
Against whom? Against the streams of the river making glad the City of God. For thereby
showed He of what river He spake; that He signified the Holy Spirit, by “the streams of the
river make glad the City of God.” And what follows? “The Most High hath sanctified His
tabernacle:” since then there followeth the mention of Sanctification, it is manifest that these

streams of the river are to be understood of the Holy Spirit, by whom is sanctified every
godly soul believing in Christ, that it may be made a citizen of the City of God.
8. “God is in the midst of her: she shall not be moved” (ver. 5). Let the sea rage, the
mountains shake; “God is in the midst of her: she shall not be moved.” What is, “in the midst
of her”? That God stands in any one place, and they surround Him who believe in Him?
Then is God circumscribed by place; and broad that which surroundeth, narrow that which
is surrounded? God forbid. No such thing imagine of God, who is contained in no place,
whose seat is the conscience of the godly: and so is God’s seat in the hearts of men, that if
man fall from God, God in Himself abideth, not falleth like one not finding where to be.
For rather doth He lift up thee, that thou mayest be in Him, than so lean upon thee, as if
thou withdraw thyself, to fall. Himself if He withdraw, fall wilt thou: thyself if thou withdraw,
fall will not He. What then is, “God is in the midst of her”? It signifieth that God is equal to
all, and accepteth not persons. For as that which is in the middle has equal distances to all
the boundaries, so God is said to be in the middle, because He consulteth equally for all.
“God is in the midst of her: she shall not be moved.” Wherefore shall she not be moved?
Because God is in the midst of her. He is “the Helper in tribulations that have found us out
too much. God shall help her with His Countenance.” What is, “with His Countenance”?
With manifestation of Himself. How manifests God Himself, so as that we see His Counten-
ance? I have already told you; ye have learned God’s Presence; we have learned it through
His works. When from Him we receive any help so that we cannot at all doubt that it was
granted to us by the Lord, then God’s Countenance is with us.
9. “The heathen are troubled” (ver. 6). And how troubled? why troubled? To cast down
the City of God, in the midst whereof is God? To overthrow the tabernacle sanctified, which
God helpeth with His Countenance? No: with a wholesome trouble are the heathen now
troubled. For what followeth? “And the kingdoms are bowed.” Bowed, saith He, are the
kingdoms; not now erected that they may rage, but bowed that they may adore. When were
the kingdoms bowed? When that came to pass which was predicted in another Psalm, “All
kings shall fall down before Him, all nations shall serve Him.”1491 What cause made the
kingdoms to bow? Hear the cause. “The Most High gave His Voice, and the earth was
moved.” The fanatics1492 of idolatry, like frogs in the marshes, clamoured, the more tumul-
tuously, the more sordidly, in filth and mire. And what is the brawling of frogs to the
thunder of the clouds? For out of them “the Most High gave His Voice, and the earth was
moved:” He thundered out of His clouds. And what are His clouds? His Apostles, His
preachers, by whom He thundered in precepts, lightened in miracles. The same are clouds
who are also mountains: mountains for their height and firmness, clouds for their rain and
1491 Ps. lxxii. 11.
1492 Arreptitii.
Psalm XLVI
fruitfulness. For these clouds watered the earth, of which it was said, “The Most High gave
His Voice, and the earth was moved.” For it is of those clouds that He threateneth a certain
barren vineyard, whence the mountains were carried into the heart of the sea; “I will com-
mand,” saith He, “the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.”1493 This was fulfilled in that
which I have mentioned, when the mountains were carried into the heart of the sea; when
it was said, “It was necessary that the word of God should have been spoken first to you;
but seeing ye put it from you, we turn to the Gentiles;”1494 then was fulfilled, “I will command
the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.” The nation of the Jews hath just so remained as
a fleece dry upon the ground. For this, ye know, happened in a certain miracle, the ground
was dry, the fleece only was wet, yet rain in the fleece appeared not.1495 So also the mystery
of the New Testament appeared not in the nation of the Jews. What there was the fleece, is
here the veil. For in the fleece was veiled the mystery. But on the ground, in all the nations
open lieth Christ’s Gospel; the rain is manifest, the Grace of Christ is bare, for it is not
covered with a veil. But that the rain might come out of it, the fleece was pressed. For by
pressure they from themselves excluded Christ, and the Lord now from His clouds raineth
on the ground, the fleece hath remained dry. But of them then “the Most High gave His
Voice,” out of those clouds; by which Voice the kingdoms were bowed and worshipped.
10. “The Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our taker up” (ver. 7). Not any
man, not any power, not, in short, Angel, or any creature either earthly or heavenly, but
“the Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our taker up.” He who sent Angels, came
after Angels, came that Angels might serve Him, came that men He might make equal to
Angels. Mighty Grace! If God be for us, who can be against us? “The Lord of Hosts is with
us.” What Lord of Hosts is with us? “If” (I say) “God be for us, who can be against us? He
that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how hath He not with Him
also freely given1496 us all things.”1497 Therefore be we secure, in tranquillity of heart
nourish we a good conscience with the Bread of the Lord. “The Lord of Hosts is with us;
the God of Jacob is our taker up.” However great be thy infirmity, see who taketh thee up.
One is sick, a physician is called to him. His own taken-up, the Physician calleth the sick
man. Who hath taken him up? Even He. A great hope of salvation; a great Physician hath
taken him up. What Physician? 1498 Every Physician save He is man: every Physician who
cometh to a sick man, another day can be made sick, beside Him. “The God of Jacob is our

taker up.” Make thyself altogether as a little child, such as are taken up by their parents. For
those not taken up, are exposed; those taken up are nursed. Thinkest thou God hath so taken
thee up, as when an infant thy mother took thee up? Not so, but to eternity. For thy voice
is in that Psalm, “My father and my mother forsake me, but the Lord hath taken me up.”1499
11. “Come and see the works of the Lord” (ver. 8). Now of this taking up, what hath the
Lord done? Consider the whole world, come and see. For if thou comest not, thou seest not;
if thou seest not, thou believest not; if thou believest not, thou standest afar off: if thou be-
lievest thou comest, if thou believest thou seest. For how came we to that mountain? Not
on foot? Is it by ship? Is it on the wing? Is it on horses? For all that pertain to space and
place, be not concerned, trouble not thyself, He cometh to thee. For out of a small stone He
hath grown, and become a great mountain, so that He hath filled all the face of the earth.
Why then wouldest thou by land come to Him, who filleth all lands? Lo, He hath already
come: watch thou. By growing He waketh even sleepers; if yet there is not in them so deep
sleep, as that they be hardened even against the mountain coming; but they hear, “Awake,
thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.”1500 For it was
a great thing for the Jews to see the stone. For the stone was yet small: and small they de-
servedly despised it, and despising they stumbled, and stumbling they were broken; remains
that they be ground to powder. For so was it said of the stone, “Whosoever shall fall upon
that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.”1501
It is one thing to be broken, another to be ground to powder. To be broken is less than to
be ground to powder: but none grindeth He coming exalted, save whom He brake lying
low. For now before His coming He lay low before the Jews, and they stumbled at Him, and
were broken; hereafter shall He come in His Judgment, glorious and exalted, great and
powerful, not weak to be judged, but strong to judge, and grind to powder those who were
broken stumbling at Him. For “A stone of stumbling and a rock of offence,”1502 is He to
them that believe not. Therefore, brethren, no wonder if the Jews acknowledged not Him,
whom as a small stone lying before their feet they despised. They are to be wondered at,
who even now so great a mountain will not acknowledge. The Jews at a small stone by not
seeing stumbled; the heretics stumble at a mountain. For now that stone hath grown, now
say we unto them, Lo, now is fulfilled the prophecy of Daniel, “The stone that was small
became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”1503 Wherefore stumble ye at Him,
and go not rather up to Him? Who is so blind as to stumble at a mountain? Came He to

thee that thou shouldest have whereat to stumble, and not have whereto to go up? “Come
ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord.”1504 Isaiah saith this: “Come ye, and let
us go up.” What is, “Come ye, and let us go up”? “Come ye,” is, Believe ye. “Let us go up,”
is, Let us profit.1505 But they will neither come, nor go up, nor believe, nor profit. They bark
against the mountain. Even now by so often stumbling on Him they are broken, and will
not go up, choosing always to stumble. Say we to them, “Come ye, and see the works of the
Lord:” what “prodigies He hath set forth through the earth.” Prodigies are called, because
they portend something, those signs of miracles which were done when the world believed.
And what thereafter came to pass, and what did they portend?
12. “He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth” (ver. 9). This not yet see we
fulfilled: yet are there wars, wars among nations for sovereignty; among sects, among Jews,
Pagans, Christians, heretics, are wars, frequent wars, some for the truth, some for falsehood
contending. Not yet then is this fulfilled, “He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the
earth;” but haply it shall be fulfilled. Or is it now also fulfilled? In some it is fulfilled; in the
wheat it is fulfilled, in the tares it is not yet fulfilled. What is this then, “He maketh wars to
cease unto the end of the earth”? Wars He calleth whereby it is warred against God. But
who warreth against God? Ungodliness. And what to God can ungodliness do? Nothing.
What doth an earthen vessel dashed against the rock, however vehemently dashed? With
so much greater harm to itself it cometh, with how much the greater force it cometh. These
wars were great, frequent were they. Against God fought ungodliness, and earthen vessels
were dashed in pieces, even men by presuming on themselves, by too much prevailing by
their own strength. This is that, the shield whereof Job also named concerning one ungodly.
“He runneth against God, upon the stiff neck of his shield.”1506 What is, “upon the stiff
neck of his shield”? Presuming too much upon his own protection. Were they such who
said, “God is our refuge and strength, a Helper in tribulations which have found us out too
much”? or in another Psalm, “For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
me.”1507 When one learneth that in himself he is nothing, and help in himself has none,
arms in him are broken in pieces, wars are made to cease. Such wars then destroyed that
Voice of the Most High out of His holy clouds, whereby the earth was moved, and the
kingdoms were bowed. These wars hath He made to cease unto the end of the earth. “He

Psalm XLVI
shall break the bow, and dash in pieces the arms, and burn the shield with fire.” Bow, arms,
shield, fire. 1508 The bow is plots; arms, public warfare; shields, vain presuming of self-pro-
tection: the fire wherewith they are burned, is that whereof the Lord said, “I am come to
send fire on the earth;”1509 of which fire saith the Psalm, “There is nothing hid from the
heat thereof.”1510 This fire burning, no arms of ungodliness shall remain in us, needs must
all be broken, dashed in pieces, burned. Remain thou unharmed, not having any help of
thine own; and the more weak thou art, having no arms thine own, the more He taketh thee
up, of whom it is said, “The God of Jacob is our taker up.”…But when God taketh us up,
doth He send us away unarmed? He armeth us, but with other arms, arms Evangelical, arms
of truth, continence, salvation, faith, hope, charity. These arms shall we have, but not of
ourselves: but the arms which of ourselves we had, are burnt up: yet if by that fire of the
Holy Spirit we are kindled, whereof it is said, “He shall burn the shields with fire;” thee, who
didst wish to be powerful in thyself, hath God made weak, that He may make thee strong
in Him, because in thyself thou wast made weak.
13. What then followeth? “Be still.” To what purpose? “And see that I am God” (ver.
10). That is, Not ye, but I am God. I created, I create anew; I formed, I form anew; I made,
I make anew. If thou couldest not make thyself, how canst thou make thyself anew? This
seeth not the contentious tumult of man’s soul; to which contentious tumult is it said, “Be
still.” That is, restrain your souls from contradiction. Do not argue, and, as it were, arm
against God. Else yet live thy arms, not yet burned up with fire. But if they are burned, “Be
still;” because ye have not wherewith to fight. But if ye be still in yourselves, and from Me
seek all, who before presumed on yourselves, then shall ye “see that I am God.” “I will be
exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.” Just before I said, by the name of
earth is signified the nation of the Jews, by the name of sea the other nations. The mountains
were carried into the heart of the sea; the nations are troubled, the kingdoms are bowed;
the Most High gave His Voice, and the earth was moved. “The Lord of Hosts is with us, the
God of Jacob is our taker up” (ver. 11). Miracles are done among the heathen, full filled is
the faith of the heathen; burned are the arms of human presumption. Still are they, in tran-
quillity of heart, to acknowledge God the Author of all their gifts. And after this glorifying,
doth He yet desert the people of the Jews? of which saith the Apostle, “I say unto you, lest
ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened unto Israel, until
the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.”1511 That is, until the mountains be carried hither,
the clouds rain here, the Lord here bows the kingdoms with His thunder, “until the fulness

of the Gentiles be come in.” And what thereafter? “And so all Israel shall be saved.” Therefore,
here too observing the same order, “I will be exalted” (saith He) “among the heathen, I will
be exalted in the earth;” that is, both in the sea, and in the earth, that now might all say what
followeth: “the God of Jacob is our taker up.”
Psalm XLVI
Psalm XLVII.1512
1. The title of the Psalm goeth thus. “To the end: for the sons of Korah: a Psalm of
David himself.” These sons of Korah have the title also of some other Psalms, and indicate
a sweet mystery, insinuate a great Sacrament: wherein let us willingly understand ourselves,
and let us acknowledge in the title us who hear, and read, and as in a glass set before us behold
who we are. The sons of Korah, who are they?1513…Haply the sons of the Bridegroom. For
the Bridegroom was crucified in the place of Calvary. Recollect the Gospel,1514 where they
crucified the Lord, and ye will find Him crucified in the place of Calvary. Furthermore, they
who deride His Cross, by devils, as by beasts, are devoured. For this also a certain Scripture
signified. When God’s Prophet Elisha was going up, children called after him mocking, “Go
up thou bald head, Go up thou bald head:” but he, not so much in cruelty as in mystery,
made those children to be devoured by bears out of the wood. 1515 If those children had not
been devoured, would they have lived even till now? Or could they not, being born mortal,
have been taken off by a fever? But so in them had no mystery been shown, whereby posterity
might be put in fear. Let none then mock the Cross of Christ. The Jews were possessed by
devils, and devoured; for in the place of Calvary, crucifying Christ, and lifting on the Cross,
they said as it were with childish sense, not understanding what they said, “Go up, thou bald
head.” For what is, “Go up”? “Crucify Him, Crucify Him.”1516 For childhood is set before
us to imitate humility, and childhood is set before us to beware of foolishness. To imitate
humility, childhood was set before us by the Lord, when He called children to Him,1517 and
because they were kept from Him, He said, “Suffer them to come unto Me, for of such is
the Kingdom of Heaven.”1518 The example of childhood is set before us to beware of fool-
ishness by the Apostle, “Brethren, be not children in understanding:” and again he proposeth
it to imitate, “Howbeit in malice be ye children, that in understanding ye may be men.”1519
“For the sons of Korah” the Psalm is sung; for Christians then is it sung. Let us hear it as
sons of the Bridegroom, whom senseless children crucified in the place of Calvary. For they
earned to be devoured by beasts; we to be crowned by Angels. For we acknowledge the hu-
mility of our Lord, and of it are not ashamed. We are not ashamed of Him called in mystery
“the bald” (Calvus), from the place of Calvary. For on the very Cross whereon He was insul-

ted, He permitted not our forehead to be bald; for with His own Cross He marked it. Finally,
that ye may know that these things are said to us, see what is said.
2. “O clap your hands, all ye nations” (ver. 1). Were the people of the Jews all the nations?
No, but blindness in part is happened to Israel, that senseless children might cry, “Calve,”
“Calve;” and so the Lord might be crucified in the place of Calvary, that by His Blood shed
He might redeem the Gentiles, and that might be fulfilled which saith the Apostle, “Blindness
in part is happened unto Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.”1520 Let them
insult, then, the vain, and foolish, and senseless, and say, “Calve,” “Calve;” but ye redeemed
by His Blood which was shed in the place of Calvary, say, “O clap your hands, all ye nations;”
because to you hath come down the Grace of God. “O clap your hands.” What is “O clap”?
Rejoice. But wherefore with the hands? Because with good works. Do not rejoice with the
mouth while idle with the hands. If ye rejoice, “clap your hands.” The hands of the nations
let Him see, who joys hath deigned to give them. What is, the hands of the nations? The
acts of them doing good works. “O clap your hands, all ye nations: shout unto God with the
voice of triumph.” Both with voice and with hands. If with the voice only it is not well, be-
cause the hands are slow; if only with the hands it is not well, because the tongue is mute.
Agree together must the hands and tongue. Let this confess, these work. “Shout unto God
with the voice of triumph.”
3. “For the Lord Most High is terrible” (ver. 2). The Most High in descending made like
one ludicrous, by ascending into Heaven is made terrible. “A great King over all the earth.”
Not only over the Jews; for over them also He is King. For of them also the Apostles believed
and of them many thousands of men sold their goods, and laid the price at the Apostles’
feet,1521 and in them was fulfilled what in the title of the Cross was written, “The King of
the Jews.”1522 For He is King also of the Jews. But “of the Jews” is little.1523 “O clap your
hands, all ye nations: for God is the King of all the earth.” For it sufficeth not Him to have
under Him one nation: therefore such great price gave He out of His side, as to buy the
whole world.
4. “He hath subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet” (ver. 3). Which
subdued, and to whom? Who are they that speak? Haply Jews? Surely, if Apostles; surely,
if Saints. For under these God hath subdued the people and the nations, that to-day are they
honoured among the nations, who by their own citizens earned to be slain: as their Lord
was slain by His citizens, and is honoured among the nations; was crucified by His own, is
adored by aliens, but those by a price made His own. For therefore bought He us, that aliens

1523 [Isa. xlix. 6.—C.]
Psalm XLVII
from Him we might not be. Thinkest thou then these are the words of Apostles, “He hath
subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet”? I know not. Strange that
Apostles should speak so proudly, as to rejoice that the nations were put under their feet,
that is, Christians under the feet of Apostles. For they rejoice that we are with them under
the feet of Him who died for us. For under Paul’s feet ran they, who would be of Paul, to
whom He said, “Was Paul crucified for you?”1524 What then here, what are we to understand?
“He hath subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet.” All pertaining to
Christ’s inheritance are among “all the nations,” and all not pertaining to Christ’s inheritance
are among “all the nations:” and ye see so exalted in Christ’s Name is Christ’s Church, that
all not yet believing in Christ lie under the feet of Christians. For what numbers now run
to the Church; not yet being Christians, they ask aid of the Church;1525 to be succoured by
us temporally they are willing, though eternally to reign with us as yet they are unwilling.
When all seek aid of the Church, even they who are not yet in the Church, hath He not
“subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet”?
5. “He hath chosen an inheritance for us, the excellency1526 of Jacob, whom He loved”
(ver. 4). A certain beauty of Jacob He hath chosen for our inheritance. Esau and Jacob were
two brothers; in their mother’s womb both struggled, and by this struggle their mother’s
bowels were shaken; and while they two were yet therein, the younger was elected and pre-
ferred to the elder, and it was said, “Two peoples are in thy womb, and the elder shall serve
the younger.” 1527 Among all nations is the elder, among all nations the younger; but the
younger is in good Christians, elect, godly, faithful; the elder in the proud, unworthy, sinful,
stubborn, defending rather than confessing their sins: as was also the very people of the
Jews, “being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own right-
eousness.”1528 But for that it is said, “The elder shall serve the younger;” it is manifest that
under the godly are subdued the ungodly, under the humble are subdued the proud. Esau
was born first, and Jacob was born last; but he who was last born, was preferred to the first-
born, who through gluttony lost his birthright. So thou hast it written,1529 He longed for
the pottage, and his brother said to him, If thou wilt that I give it thee, give me thy birthright.
He loved more that which carnally he desired, than that which spiritually by being born
first he had earned:1530 and he laid aside his birthright, that he might eat lentils. But lentils

we find to be the food of the Egyptians, for there it abounds in Egypt. Whence is so magnified
the lentil of Alexandria, that it comes even to our country, as if here grew no lentil. Therefore
by desiring Egyptian food he lost his birthright. So also the people of the Jews, of whom it
is said, “in their hearts they turned back again into Egypt.”1531 They desired in a manner
the lentil, and lost their birthright.
6. “God is gone up with jubilation” (ver. 5). Even He our God, the Lord Christ, is gone
up with jubilation; “the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.” “Is gone up:” whither, save where
we know? Whither the Jews followed Him not, even with their eyes. For exalted on the Cross
they mocked Him, ascending into Heaven they did not see Him. “God hath gone up with
jubilation.” What is jubilation, but admiration of joy which cannot be expressed in words?
As the disciples in joy admired, seeing Him go into Heaven, whom they had mourned dead;
truly for the joy, words sufficed not: remained to jubilate what none could express. There
was also the voice of the trumpet, the voice of Angels. For it is said, “Lift up thy voice like
a trumpet.” Angels preached the ascension of the Lord: they saw the Disciples, their Lord
ascending, tarrying, admiring, confounded, nothing speaking, but in heart jubilant: and
now was the sound of the trumpet in the clear voice of the Angels, “Ye men of Galilee, why
stand ye gazing up into Heaven? this is Jesus.”1532 As if they knew not that it was the same
Jesus. Had they not just before seen Him before them? Had they not heard Him speaking
with them? Nay, they not only saw the figure of Him present, but handled also His limbs.
Of themselves then knew they not, that it was the same Jesus? But they being by very admir-
ation, from joy of jubilation, as it were transported in mind, the Angels said, “that same is
Jesus.” As though they said, If ye believe Him, this is that same Jesus, whom crucified, your
feet stumbled, whom dead and buried, ye thought your hope lost. Lo, this is the same Jesus.
He hath gone up before you, “He shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into
Heaven.” His Body is removed indeed from your eyes, but God is not separated from your
hearts: see Him going up, believe on Him absent, hope for Him coming; but yet through
His secret Mercy, feel Him present. For He who ascended into Heaven that He might be
removed from your eyes, promised unto you, saying, “Lo, I am with you always, even unto
the end of the world.”1533 Justly then the Apostle so addressed us, “The Lord is at hand; be
careful for nothing.”1534 Christ sitteth above the Heavens; the Heavens are far off, He who
there sitteth is near.…
7. “Sing praises to our God, sing praises” (ver. 6). Whom as Man mocked they, who
from God were alienated. “Sing praises to our God.” For He is not Man only, but God. Man

of the seed of David,1535 God the Lord of David, of the Jews having flesh. “Whose” (saith
the Apostle) “are the fathers, of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.”1536 Of the Jews
then is Christ, but according to the flesh. But who is this Christ who is of the Jews according
to the flesh? “Who is over all, God blessed for ever.” God before the flesh, God in the flesh,
God with the flesh. Nor only God before the flesh, but God before the earth whence flesh
was made; nor only God before the earth whereof flesh was made, but even God before the
Heaven which was first made; God before the day which was first made; God before Angels;
the same Christ is God: for “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.”1537
8. “For God is the King of all the earth” (ver. 7). What? And before was He not God of
all the earth? Is He not God of both heaven and earth, since by Him surely were all things
made? Who can say that He is not his God? But not all men acknowledged Him their God;
and where He was acknowledged, there only, so to say, He was God. “In Judah is God
known.”1538 Not yet was it said to the sons of Korah, “O clap your hands, all ye nations.”
For that God known in Judah, is King of all the earth: now by all He is acknowledged, for
that is fulfilled which Isaiah saith, “He is thy God who hath delivered thee, the God of the
whole earth shall He be called.”1539 “Sing ye praises with understanding.” He teacheth us
and warneth us to sing praises with understanding, not to seek the sound of the ear, but the
light of the heart. The Gentiles, whence ye were called that ye might be Christians, adored
gods made with hands, and sang praises to them, but not with understanding. If they had
sung with understanding, they had not adored stones. When a man sensible sang to a stone
insensible, did he sing with understanding? But now, brethren, we see not with our eyes
Whom we adore, and yet correctly1540 we adore.1541 Much more is God commended to us,
that with our eyes we see Him not. If with our eyes we saw Him, haply we might despise.
For even Christ seen, the Jews despised; unseen, the Gentiles adored.
9. “God shall reign over all nations” (ver. 8). Who reigned over one nation, “shall reign”
(saith He) “over all nations.” When this was said, God reigned over one nation. It was a
prophecy, the thing was not yet shown. Thanks be to God, we now see fulfilled what before
was prophesied. A written promise God sent unto us before the time, the time fulfilled He
hath repaid us. “God shall reign over all nations,” is a promise. “God sitteth upon His Holy

Seat.” What then was promised to come, now being fulfilled, is acknowledged and held.
“God sitteth upon His Holy Seat.” What is His Holy Seat? Haply saith one, The Heavens,
and he understandeth well. For Christ hath gone up,1542 as we know, with the Body, wherein
He was crucified, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; thence we expect Him to come
to judge the quick and the dead.1543 “God sitteth upon His Holy Seat.” The Heavens are
His Holy Seat. Wilt thou also be His Seat? think not that thou canst not be; prepare for Him
a place in thy heart. He cometh, and willingly sitteth. The same Christ is surely “the Power
of God, and the Wisdom of God:”1544 and what saith the Scripture of Wisdom Herself? The
soul of the righteous is the seat of Wisdom.1545 If then the soul of the righteous is the seat
of Wisdom, be thy soul righteous, and thou shalt be a royal seat of Wisdom. And truly,
brethren, all men who live well, who act well, converse in godly charity, doth not God sit in
them, and Himself command? Thy soul obeyeth God sitting in it, and itself commandeth
the members. For thy soul commandeth thy members, that so may move the foot, the hand,
the eye, the ear, and itself commandeth the members as its servants, but yet itself serveth
its Lord sitting within. It cannot well rule its inferior, unless its superior it have not disdained
to serve.
10. “The princes of the peoples are gathered together unto the God of Abraham” (ver.
9). The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.1546 True it is, God
said this, and thereupon the Jews prided themselves, and said, “We are Abraham’s chil-
dren;”1547 priding themselves in their father’s name, carrying his flesh, not holding his faith;
by seed cleaving to Him, in manners degenerating. But the Lord, what said He to them so
priding themselves? “If ye are Abraham’s children, do the works of Abraham.”1548
Again…“The princes of the peoples:” the princes of the nations: not the princes of one
people, but the princes of all people have “gathered together unto the God of Abraham.”
Of these princes was that Centurion too, of whom but now when the Gospel was read ye
heard. For he was a Centurion having honour and power among men, he was a prince
among the princes of the peoples. Christ coming to him, he sent his friends to meet Him,
nay unto Christ truly passing over to him he sent his friends, and asked that He would heal
his servant who was dangerously sick. And when the Lord would come, he sent to Him this
message: “I am not worthy that Thou shouldest enter under my roof, but say in a word only,

and my servant shall be healed.” “For I also am a man set under authority, having under me
soldiers.”1549 See how he kept his rank! first he mentioned that he was under another, and
afterwards that another was under him. I am under authority, and I am in authority; both
under some I am, and over some I am.…As though he said, If I being set under authority
command those who are under me, Thou who art set under no man’s authority, canst not
Thou command Thy creature, since all things were made by Thee, and without Thee was
nothing made. “Say,” then, said he, “in a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I am not
worthy that Thou shouldest enter under my roof.”…Admiring at his faith, Jesus reprobates
the Jews’ misbelief. For sound to themselves they seemed, whereas they were dangerously
sick, when their Physician not knowing they slew. Therefore when He reprobated, and re-
pudiated their pride what said he? “I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and
west,” not belonging to the kindred of Israel: many shall come to whom He said, “O clap
your hands, all ye nations;” “and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the
kingdom of heaven.” Abraham begat them not of his own flesh; yet shall they come and sit
down with him in the kingdom of heaven, and be his sons. Whereby his sons? Not as born
of his flesh, but by following his faith. “But the children of the kingdom,” that is, the Jews,
“shall be cast into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”1550 They
shall be condemned to outer darkness who are born of the flesh of Abraham, and they shall
sit down with him in the kingdom of heaven, who have imitated Abraham’s faith.
11. And what they who belonged to the God of Abraham? “For the mighty gods of the
earth are greatly lifted up.” They who were gods, the people of God, the vineyard of God,
whereof it is said, “Judge betwixt Me and My vineyard,”1551 shall go into outer darkness,
shall not sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, are not gathered unto the God of
Abraham. Wherefore? “For the mighty gods of the earth;” they who were mighty gods of
the earth, presuming upon earth. What earth? Themselves; for every man is earth. For to
man was it said, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”1552 But man ought to
presume upon God, and thence to hope for help, not from himself. For the earth raineth
not upon itself, nor shineth for itself; but as the earth from heaven expecteth rain and light,
so man from God ought to expect mercy and truth. They then, “the mighty gods of the earth,
were greatly lifted up,” that is, greatly prided themselves: they thought no physician necessary
for themselves, and therefore remained in their sickness, and by their sickness were brought
down even to death. The natural branches were broken off that the humble wild olive tree

might be grafted in.1553 Hold we fast then, brethren, humility, charity, godliness: since we
are called, on their proving reprobate, even by their example let us fear to pride ourselves.
1553 Rom. xi. 17.
Psalm XLVII
Psalm XLVIII.1554
1. The title of this Psalm is, “A song of praise, to the sons of Korah, on the second day
of the week.” Concerning this what the Lord deigneth to grant receive ye like sons of the
firmament. For on the second day of the week, that is, the day after the first which we call
the Lord’s day, which also is called the second week-day, was made the firmament of
Heaven.1555…The second day of the week then we ought not to understand but of the
Church of Christ: but the Church of Christ in the Saints, the Church of Christ in those who
are written in Heaven, the Church of Christ in those who to this world’s temptations yield
not. For they are worthy of the name of “firmament.” The Church of Christ, then, in those
who are strong, of whom saith the Apostle, “We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities
of the weak,” 1556 is called the firmament. Of this it is sung in this Psalm. Let us hear, ac-
knowledge, associate, glory, reign. For Her called firmament, hear also in the Apostolic
Epistles, “the pillar and firmament1557 of the truth.”1558…
2. “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised” (ver. 1).…That is, “in the city of our
God, in His holy mountain.” This is the city set upon an hill, which cannot be hid: this is
the candle which is not hidden under a bushel,1559 to all known, to all proclaimed. Yet are
not all men citizens thereof, but they in whom “great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised.”
What then is that city: let us see whether perhaps, since it is said, “In the city of our God, in
His holy mountain,” we ought not to enquire for this mountain where also we may be
heard.…What then is that mountain, brethren? One is it with great care to be enquired for,
with great solicitude investigated, with labour also to be occupied and ascended. But if in
any part of the earth it is, what shall we do? Shall we go abroad out of our own country, that
to that mountain we may arrive? Nay, then we are abroad, when in it we are not. For that
is our city, if we are members of the King, who is the head of the same city.…For there was
a certain corner-stone contemptible, whereat the Jews stumbled,1560 cut out of a certain
mountain without hands, that is, coming of the kingdom of the Jews without hands, because
human operation went not with Mary of whom was born Christ.1561 But if that stone, when
the Jews stumbled thereat, had remained there, thou hadst not had whither to ascend. But
what was done? What saith the prophecy of Daniel? What but that the stone grew, and be-

came a great mountain? How great? So that it filled the whole face of the earth.1562 By
growing, then, and by filling the whole face of the earth, that mountain came to us. Why
then seek we the mountain as though absent, and not as being present ascend to it; that in
us the Lord may be “great, and greatly to be praised”?
3. Further,…when he had said, “in the city of our God, in His holy mountain,” what
added he? “Spreading abroad the joys of the whole earth, the mountains of Sion” (ver. 2).
Sion is one mountain, why then “mountains”? Is it that to Sion belonged also those which
came from the other side, so as to meet together on the Corner Stone, and become two walls,
as it were two mountains, one of the circumcision, the other of the uncircumcision; one of
the Jews, the other of the Gentiles: no longer adverse, although diverse, because from different
sides, now in the corner not even diverse. “For He is our peace, who hath made both one.”1563
The same Corner Stone “which the builders rejected, is become the Head Stone of the
corner.”1564 The mountain hath joined in itself two mountains; one house there is, and two
houses; two, because coming from different sides; one, because of the Corner Stone, wherein
both are joined together. Hear also this, “the mountains of Sion: the sides of the North are
the city of the great King.”…See the Gentiles; “the sides of the North:” the sides of the North
are joined to the city of the great King. The North is wont to be contrary to Sion: Sion for-
sooth is in the South, the North over against the South. Who is the North, but He who said,
“I will sit in the sides of the North, I will be like the Most High”?1565 The devil had held
dominion over the ungodly, and possessed the nations serving images, adoring demons;
and all whatsoever there was of human kind anywhere throughout the world, by cleaving
to Him, had become North. But since He who binds the strong man, taketh away his
goods,1566 and maketh them His own goods; men delivered from infidelity and superstition
of devils, believing in Christ, are fitted on to that city, have met in the corner that wall that
cometh from the circumcision, and that was made the city of the great King, which had
been the sides of the North. Therefore also in another Scripture is it said, “Out of the North
come clouds of golden colour: great is the glory and honour of the Almighty.”1567 For great
is the glory of the physician, when from being despaired of the sick recovers. “Out of the
North come clouds,” and not black clouds, not dark clouds, not lowering, but “of golden
colour.” Whence but by grace illumined through Christ? See, “the sides of the North are the
city of the great King.”…

4. Let the Psalm then follow, and say, “God shall be known in her houses.” Now in her
“houses,” because of the mountains, because of the two walls, because of the two sons. “God
shall be known in her houses,” but he commendeth grace, therefore he added, “when He
shall take her up.” For what would that city have been, unless He had taken her up? Would
it not immediately have fallen, unless it had such foundation? For “other foundation can
no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”1568 Let none then glory in his own
merits; but “he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”1569…The Lord then hath taken up
this city, and is known therein, that is, His grace is known in that city: for whatever that city
hath, which glorieth in the Lord, it hath not of itself. For because of this it is said, “What
hast thou that thou didst not receive?”1570
5. “For, lo, the kings of the earth are gathered together” (ver. 3). Behold now those sides
of the North, see how they come, see how they say, “Come ye, and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord: and He will teach us His way, and we will walk in it.”1571 “And have
come together in one.” In what one, but that “corner-stone”?1572 “They saw it, and so they
marvelled” (ver. 4). After their marvelling at the miracles and glory of Christ, what followed?
“They were troubled, they were moved” (ver. 5), “trembling took hold upon them.” Whence
took trembling hold upon them, but from the consciousness of sins? Let them run then,
king after a king; kings, let them acknowledge the King. Therefore saith He elsewhere, “Yet
have I been set by Him a King upon His holy hill of Sion.”1573…A King then was heard of,
set up in Sion, to Him were delivered possessions even to the uttermost parts of the earth.
Kings behoved to fear lest they should lose the kingdom, lest the kingdom be taken from
them. As wretched Herod feared, and for the Child slew the children.1574 But fearing to lose
his kingdom, he deserved not to know the King. Would that he too had adored the King
with the Magi: not by ill-seeking the kingdom, slain the Innocents, and perished guilty. For
as concerning him, he destroyed the Innocents: but as for Christ, even a Child, the children
dying for Him did He crown. Therefore behoved kings to fear when it was said, “Yet have
I been set a King by Him upon His holy hill of Sion,” and inheritance to the uttermost parts
of the earth shall He give Him, who set Him up King.…Thence also this is said to them,
“Understand now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord
with fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.”1575 And what did they? “There pains as

of a woman in travail.” What are the pains “as of a woman in travail,” but the pangs of a
penitent? See the same conception of pain and travail: “Of Thy fear” (saith Isaiah) “we have
conceived, we have travailed of the Spirit of salvation.”1576 So then the kings conceived from
the fear of Christ, that by travailing they brought forth salvation by believing on Him whom
they had feared. “There pains as of a woman in travail:” when of travail thou hearest, expect
a birth. The old man travaileth, but the new man is born.
6. “With a strong wind Thou shalt break the ships of Tarshish” (ver. 6). Briefly under-
stood, this is, Thou shalt overthrow the pride of the nations. But where in this history is
mentioned the overthrowing of the pride of the nations? Because of “the ships of Tarshish.”
Learned men have enquired for Tarshish a city, that is, what city was signified by this name:
and to some it has seemed that Cilicia is called Tarshish, because its metropolis is called
Tarsus. Of which city was the Apostle Paul, being born in Tarsus of Cilicia.1577 But some
have understood by it Carthage, being haply sometimes so named, or in some language so
signified. For in the Prophet Isaiah it is thus found: “Howl, ye ships of Carthage.”1578 But
in Ezekiel1579 by some interpreters the word is translated Carthage, by some Tarshish: and
from this diversity it can be understood that the same which was called Carthage, is called
Tharsus. But it is manifest, that in the beginning of its reign Carthage flourished with ships,
and so flourished, that among other nations they excelled in trafficking and navigation. For
when Dido, flying from her brother, escaped to the parts of Africa, where she built Carthage,
the ships which had been prepared for commerce in his country she had taken with her for
her flight, the princes of the country consenting to it; and the same ships also when Carthage
was built failed not in traffic. And hence that city became too proud, so that justly by its
ships may be understood the pride of the nations, presuming on things uncertain, as on the
breath of the winds. Now let none presume on full sails, and on the seeming fair state of this
life, as of the sea. Be our foundation in Sion: there ought we to be stablished, not to be
“carried about with every wind of doctrine.”1580 Whoso then by the uncertain things of this
life had been puffed up, let them be overthrown, and be all the pride of the nations subjected
to Christ, who shall “with a strong wind break all the ships of Tarshish:” not of any city, but
of “Tarshish.” How “with a strong wind”? With very strong fear. For so all pride feared Him
that shall judge, as on Him humble to believe, lest Him exalted it should fear.

in Prophecy, seeth in the Gospel. For all things which are now fulfilled were before proph-
esied. Lift up thine eyes then, and stretch them over the world; see now His “inheritance
even to the uttermost parts of the earth:” 1581 see now is fulfilled what was said, “All kings
shall fall down before Him: all nations shall serve Him:”1582 see fulfilled what was said, “Be
Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.”1583 See Him
whose feet and hands were pierced with nails, whose bones hanging on the tree were counted,
upon whose vesture lots were cast:1584 see reigning whom they saw hanging; see sitting in
Heaven1585 whom they despised walking on earth: see thus fulfilled, “All the ends of the
earth shall remember, and turn to the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship
before Him.” Seeing all this, exclaim with joy, “As we have heard, so have we seen.” Justly
the Church herself is so called out of the Gentiles.…They to whom the Prophets were not
sent, first heard and understood the Prophets: they who first heard not, afterwards hearing
marvelled. They remained behind to whom they were sent, carrying the books, understanding
not the truth: having the tables of the Testament, and not holding the inheritance. But
we,…“As we have heard, so have we seen.” And where hearest thou? where seest thou? “In
the city of the Lord of Hosts, in the city of our God. God hath founded it for ever.” Let not
heretics insult, divided into parties, let them not exalt themselves who say, “Lo, here is Christ,
or lo, there.” 1586 Whoso saith, “Lo, here is Christ, or lo, there,” inviteth to parties. Unity
God promised. The kings are gathered together in one, not dissipated through schisms. But
haply that city which hath held the world, shall sometime be overthrown? Far be the thought!
“God hath founded it for ever.” If then God hath founded it for ever, why fearest thou lest
the firmament should fall?
8. “We have received Thy mercy, O God, in the midst of Thy people” (ver. 8). Who have
received, and where received? Hath not the same Thy people received Thy mercy. If Thy
people hath received Thy mercy, how then, “in the midst of Thy people”? As if they who
received were one party, they in the midst of whom they received another. A great mystery,
but yet well known. When hence also, that is, out of these verses, hath been extracted and
brought forth what ye know; it will be not ruder, but sweeter. Now forsooth all are reckoned
the people of God, who carry His Sacraments, but not all belong to His Mercy. All forsooth
receiving the Sacrament of the Baptism of Christ, are called Christians, but not all live
worthily of that Sacrament. There are some of whom saith the Apostle, “Having a form of

godliness, but denying the power thereof.”1587 Yet on account of this form of godliness they
are named among God’s people. As to the floor, until the corn is threshed, belongs not the
wheat only, but the chaff. But will it also belong to the garner? In the midst then of an evil
people is a good people, which hath received the Mercy of God. He liveth worthily of the
Mercy of God who heareth, and holdeth, and doeth what the Apostle saith, “We beseech
you that ye receive not the Grace of God in vain.”1588 Whoso then receiveth not the Grace
of God in vain, the same receiveth not only the Sacrament, but also the Mercy of God as
well.…So those who have the Sacraments, and have not good manners, are both said to be
of God, and not of God; are both said to be His, and to be strangers: His because of His own
Sacraments, strangers because of their own vice. So also strange daughters:1589 daughters,
because of the form of godliness; strange, because of their loss of virtue. Be the lily there; let
it receive the Mercy of God: hold fast the root of a good flower, be not ungrateful for soft
rain coming from heaven. Be thorns ungrateful, let them grow by the showers: for the fire
they grow, not for the garner. In the midst of Thy people not receiving Thy mercy, we have
received Thy mercy. For “He came unto His own, and His own received Him not,” yet, in
the midst of them, “as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons
of God.”1590…
9. For when he had said, “We have received Thy mercy in the midst of Thy people,” he
signified that there is a people not receiving the mercy of God, in the midst of whom some
do receive the mercy of God: and then lest it should occur to men that there are so few, as
to be nearly none, how did He console them in the words following? “According to Thy
Name, O God, so is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth” (ver. 9). What is this? …That is,
as Thou art known through all the earth, so Thou art also praised through all the earth, nor
are there wanting who now praise Thee through all the earth. But they praise Thee who live
well. For, “According to Thy Name, O God, so is Thy praise,” not in a part, but “unto the
ends of the earth.” “Thy right hand is full of righteousness.” That is, many are they also who
shall stand at Thy right hand. Not only shall they be many who shall stand at Thy left hand,
but there also shall be a full heap set at Thy right hand.
10. “Let mount Zion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad, because of Thy judg-
ments, O Lord” (ver. 10). O mount Zion, O daughters of Judah, ye labour now among tares,
among chaff, among thorns ye labour: yet be glad because of God’s judgments. God erreth
not in judgment. Live ye separate, though separate ye were not born; not vainly hath a voice
gone forth from your mouth and heart, “Destroy not my soul with sinners, nor my life with

bloody men.”1591 He shall winnow with such art, carrying in His hand a fan, that not one
grain of wheat shall fall into the heap of chaff prepared to be burned, nor one beard of chaff
pass to the heap to be laid up in the garner.1592 Be glad, O ye daughters of Judæa, because
of the judgments of God that erreth not, and do not yet judge rashly. To you let it belong
to collect, to Him let it belong to separate. But think not that the “daughters of Judah” are
Jews. Judah is confession; all the sons of confession are all the sons of Judah. For “salvation
is of the Jews,”1593 is nothing else than that Christ is of the Jews. This saith also the Apostle,
“He is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in
the flesh: but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.”1594 Be such a Jew; glory
in the circumcision of the heart, though thou hast not the circumcision of the flesh. Let the
daughters of Judah be glad, because of Thy judgments, O Lord.
11. “Walk about Zion, and embrace her” (ver. 11). Be it said to them who live ill, in the
midst of whom is the people, which hath received the mercy of God. In the midst of you is
a people living well, “Walk about Zion.” But how? “embrace her.” Not with scandals, but
with love go round about her: that so those who live well in the midst of you ye may imitate,
and by imitation of them, be incorporate with Christ, whose members they are. “Walk about
Zion, go round about her: speak in the towers thereof.” In the height of her bulwarks, set
forth the praises thereof.
12. “Set your hearts upon her might” (ver. 12). Not that ye may have the form of godli-
ness, deny the power thereof,1595 but, “upon her might set your hearts. Speak ye in her
towers.” What is the might of this city? Whoso would understand the might of this city, let
him understand the force of love. That is a virtue which none conquereth. Love’s flame no
waves of the world, no streams of temptation, extinguish. Of this it is said, “Love is strong
as death.”1596 For as when death cometh, it cannot be resisted; by whatever arts, whatever
medicines, you meet it; the violence of death can none avoid who is born mortal; so against
the violence of love can the world do nothing. For from the contrary the similitude is made
of death; for as death is most violent to take away, so love is most violent to save. Through
love many have died to the world, to live to God; by this love inflamed, the martyrs, not
pretenders, not puffed up by vain-glory, not such as they of whom it is written, “Though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing,”1597 but men

whom truly a love of Christ and of the truth led on to this passion; what to them were the
temptations of the tormentors? Greater violence had the eyes of their weeping friends, than
the persecutions of enemies. For how many were held by their children, that they might not
suffer? to how many did their wives fall upon their knees, that they might not be left widows?
How many have their parents forbidden to die; as we know and read in the Passion of the
Blessed Perpetua!1598 All this was done; but tears, however great, and with whatever force
flowing, when did they extinguish the ardour of love? This is the might of Sion, to whom
elsewhere it is said, “Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.”1599
13. What here understand we, “Set your hearts upon her might, and distribute her
houses”? That is, distinguish house from house. Do not confound. For there is a house
having the form of godliness, and not having godliness; but there is a house having both
form and godliness. Distribute, confound not. But then ye distribute and confound not,
when ye “set your hearts upon her might;” that is, when through love ye are made spiritual.
Then ye will not judge rashly, then ye will see that the evil harms not the good as long as we
are in this floor. “Distribute her houses.” There can be also another understanding. The two
houses, one coming of the circumcision, one of the uncircumcision, it is commanded the
Apostles to distribute. For when Saul was called, and made the Apostle Paul, agreeing in
unity with his fellow Apostles, he so with thorn determined, that they should go to the cir-
cumcision, he to the uncircumcision. By that dispensation of their Apostleship, they distrib-
uted the houses of the city of the great King; and meeting in the corner, divided the Gospel
in dispensation, in love united it. And truly this is rather to be understood; for it followeth
and showeth that it is here said to the preachers, “distribute her houses: that ye may tell it
to the generation following:” that is, that even to us, who were to come after them, their
dispensation of the Gospel should reach: For not for those only they laboured, with whom
they lived in the earth; nor the Lord for those Apostles only to whom He deigned to show
Himself alive after His Resurrection, but for us also. For to them He spake, and signified us
when He spake, “Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.”1600 Were they then
to be here alway, even to the end of the world? Also He said, “Neither pray I for these alone,
but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.”1601 Therefore He con-
sidereth us, because He suffered on account of us. Justly then it is said, “That ye may tell it
to the generation following.”

14. Tell what? “For this is God, even our God” (ver. 13). The earth was seen, the earth’s
Creator was not seen; the flesh was held, God in the flesh was not acknowledged. For the
flesh was held by those from whom had been taken the same flesh, for of the seed of Abraham
was the Virgin Mary. At the flesh they stayed, the Divinity they did not understand. O
Apostles, O mighty city, preach thou on the towers, and say, “This is God, even our God.”
So, even so as He was despised, as He lay a stone before the feet of the stumbling, that He
might humble the hearts of the confessing; even so, “This is God, even our God.” Certainly
He was seen, as was said, “Afterward did He show Himself upon earth, and conversed with
men.”1602 “This is God, even our God.” He is also Man, and who is there will know Him?
“This is God, even our God.” But haply for a time as the false gods. For because they can be
called gods, but cannot be so, for a time they are even called so. For what saith the Prophet,
or what warneth He to be said to them? This shall ye say to them, “The gods that have not
made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from those that
are under the heavens.” 1603 He is not such a god: for our God is above all gods. Above all
what gods? “For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.”1604
The same then is our God. “This is God, even our God.” For how long? “For ever and ever:
He shall rule us for ever.” If He is our God, He is also our King. He protecteth us, being our
God, lest we die; He ruleth us, being our King, lest we fall. But by ruling us He doth not
break us; for whom He ruleth not, He breaketh. “Thou shalt rule them,” saith He, “with a
rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” 1605 But there are whom He
ruleth not; these He spareth not, as a potter’s vessel dashing them in pieces. By Him then
let us wish to be ruled and delivered, “for He is our God for ever and ever, and He shall rule
us for ever.”

Psalm XLVIII
Psalm XLIX.1606
The First Part.
1. …“Hear ye these things, all ye nations” (ver. 1). Not then you only who are here. For
of what power is our voice so to cry out, as that all nations may hear? For Our Lord Jesus
Christ hath proclaimed it through the Apostles, hath proclaimed it in so many tongues that
He sent; and we see this Psalm, which before was only repeated in one nation, in the Syn-
agogue of the Jews, now repeated throughout the whole world, throughout all Churches;
and that fulfilled which is here spoken of, “Hear ye these words, all ye nations.”…Of whom
ye are: “With ears ponder, all ye that dwell in the world.” This He seemeth to have repeated
a second time, lest to have said “hear,” before, were too little. What I say, he saith, “hear,
with ears ponder,” that is, hear not cursorily. What is, “with ears ponder”? It is what the
Lord said, “he that hath ears to hear, let him hear:” 1607 for as all who were in His presence
must have had ears, what ears did He require save those of the heart, when He said, “he that
hath ears to hear, let him hear”? The same ears also this Psalm doth smite. “With ears ponder,
all ye that dwell in the world.” Perhaps there is here some distinction. We ought not indeed
to narrow our view, but there is no harm in explaining even this view of the sense. Perhaps
there is some difference between the saying, “all nations,” and the saying, “all ye that dwell
in the world.” For perchance he would have us understand the expression, “dwell in,” with
a further meaning, so as to take all nations for all the wicked, but the dwellers of the world
all the just. For he doth inhabit who is not held fast: but he that is occupied is inhabited,
and doth not inhabit. Just as he doth possess whatever he hath, who is master of his property:
but a master is one who is not held in the meshes of covetousness: while he that is held fast
by covetousness is the possessed, and not the possessor.…
2. Therefore let even the ungodly hear: “Hear ye this, all ye nations.” Let the just also
hear, who have not heard to no purpose, and who rather rule the world than are ruled by
the world: “with ears ponder, all ye that dwell in the world.”
3. And again he saith, “both all ye earthborn, and sons of men” (ver. 2). The expression
“earthborn” he doth refer to sinners; the expression “sons of men” to the faithful and
righteous. Ye see then that this distinction is observed. Who are the “earthborn”? The children
of the earth. Who are the children of the earth? They who desire earthly inheritances. Who
are the “sons of men”? They who appertain to the Son of Man. We have already before ex-
plained this distinction to your Sanctity, 1608 and have concluded that Adam was a man,
but not the son of man; that Christ was the Son of Man, but was God also. For whosoever
pertain to Adam, are “earthborn:” whosoever pertain to Christ, are “sons of men.” Never-

theless, let all hear, I withhold my discourse from no one. If one is “earthborn,” let him hear,
because of the judgment: another is a “son of man,” let him hear for the kingdom’s sake.
“The rich and poor together.” Again, the same words are repeated. The expression “rich”
refers to the “earthborn;” but the word “poor” to the “sons of men.” By the “rich” understand
the proud, by the “poor” the humble.…He saith in another Psalm, “The poor shall eat and
be satisfied.”1609 How hath he commended the poor? “The poor shall eat and be satisfied.”
What eat they? That Food which the faithful know. How shall they be satisfied? By imitating
the Passion of their Lord, and not without cause receiving their recompense. “The poor
shall eat and be satisfied, and they shall praise the Lord who seek Him.” What of the rich?
Even they eat. But how eat they? “All the rich upon the earth have eaten and worshipped.”
1610 He said not, “Have eaten and are satisfied;” but, “have eaten and worshipped.” They
worship God indeed, but they will not display brotherly humaneness. These eat and worship;
those eat and are filled: yet both eat. Of the eater what he eateth is required: let him not be
forbidden by the distributor to eat, but let him be admonished to fear him who doth require
his account. Let these words then be heard by sinners and righteous, nations, and those who
inhabit the world, “earthborn and sons of men, the rich and the poor together:” not divided,
not separated. That is for the time of the harvest to do, the hand of the winnower will effect
that.1611 Now together let rich and poor hear, let goats and sheep feed in the same pasture,
until He come who shall separate the one on His right hand, the other on His left.1612 Let
them all hear together the teacher, lest separated from one another they hear the voice of
the Judge.
4. And what is it they are now to hear? “My mouth shall speak of wisdom, and the
meditation of my heart understanding” (ver. 3). And this repetition is perhaps made, lest
perchance if he had said only “my mouth,” thou shouldest suppose that one spake to thee
who had understanding but in his lips. For many have understanding in their lips, but have
not in their heart, of whom the Scripture saith, “This people honoureth me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me.”1613 What saith he then who speaketh to thee? when he hath
said, “My mouth shall speak of wisdom,” in order that thou mayest know that what is poured
forth from the mouth floweth from the bottom of the heart, he hath added, “And the med-
itation of my heart of understanding.”
5. “I will incline mine ear to the parable, I will show my proposition upon the harp”
(ver. 4).…And why “to a parable”? Because “now we see through a glass darkly,”1614 as saith

the Apostle; “whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.”1615 For our
vision is not yet that face to face, where there are no longer parables, where there no longer
are riddles and comparisons. Whatever now we understand we behold through riddles. A
riddle is a dark parable which it is hard to understand. Howsoever a man may cultivate his
heart and apply himself to apprehend mysteries, so long as we see through the corruption
of this flesh, we see but in part.…But as He was seen by those who believed, and by those
who crucified Him, when He was judged; so will He be seen, when He shall have begun to
be judge, both by those whom He shall condemn, and by those whom He shall crown. But
that vision of divinity, which He hath promised to them that love Him, when He saith, “He
that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and he that loveth Me keepeth My command-
ments, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him:”1616 this the ungodly shall not
see. This manifestation is in a certain way familiar: He keepeth it for His own, He will not
show it to the ungodly. Of what sort is the vision itself? Of what sort is Christ? Equal to the
Father. Of what sort is Christ? “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God.”1617 For this vision we sigh now, and groan so long as we
sojourn here; to this vision we shall be brought home at the last, this vision now we see but
darkly. If then we see now darkly, let us “incline our ear to the parable,” and then let us
“show our proposition upon the harp:”1618 let us hear what we say, do what we enjoin.
6. And what hath he said? “And wherefore shall I fear in the evil day? The iniquity of
my heel shall compass me” (ver. 5). He beginneth something obscurely. Therefore he ought
the rather to fear if the iniquity of his heel shall compass him. Nay, for let not man fear, he
saith, who hath not power to escape. For example, he who feareth death, what shall he do
to escape death? Let him tell me how he is to escape what Adam oweth, he who is born of
Adam. But let him consider that he is born of Adam, and hath followed Christ, and ought
to pay what Adam oweth, and obtain what Christ hath promised. Therefore, he who feareth
death can no wise escape: but he who feareth the damnation which the ungodly shall hear,
“Go ye into everlasting fire,”1619 hath an escape. Let him not fear then. For why should he
fear? Will the iniquity of his heel compass him? If then he avoid “the iniquity of his heel,”
and walk in the ways of God, he shall not come to the evil day: the evil day, the last day, shall
not be evil to him.…Now while they live, let them take heed to themselves, let them put
away iniquity from their heel: let them walk in that way, let them walk in the way of which

Part 1
He saith Himself, “I am the way, the truth, and the life:”1620 and let them not fear in the evil
day, for He giveth them safety who became “The Way.” Therefore let them avoid the iniquity
of their heel. With the heel a man slippeth. Let your Love observe. What was said by God
to the Serpent? “She shall mark thy head, and thou shalt mark her heel.”1621 The devil
marketh thy heel, in order that when thou slippest he may overthrow thee. He marketh thy
heel, do thou mark his head. What is his head? The beginning of an evil suggestion. When
he beginneth to suggest evil thoughts, then do thou thrust him away before pleasure ariseth,
and consent followeth; and so shalt thou avoid his head, and he shall not grasp thy heel. But
wherefore said He this to Eve? Because through the flesh man doth slip. Our flesh is an Eve
within us. “He that loveth his wife,” he saith, “loveth himself.” What meaneth “himself”?
He continueth, and saith, “For no man ever yet hath hated his own flesh.”1622 Because then
the devil would make us slip through the flesh, just as he made that man Adam to slip,
through Eve; Eve is bidden to mark the head of the devil, because the devil marketh her
heel.1623 “If then the iniquity of our heel shall compass us, why fear we in the evil day,” since
being converted to Christ we are able not to do iniquity; and there will be nothing to compass
us, and we shall joy and not sorrow in the last day?
7. But who are they whom the “iniquity of their heel shall compass”? “They who trust
in their virtue,1624 and in the abundance of their riches do glory” (ver. 6). Therefore such
sins will I avoid, and the “iniquity of my heel” shall never compass me. What is avoiding
such sins? Let us not trust in our own virtue, let us not glory in the abundance of our own
riches, but let us glory in Him who hath promised to us, being humble, exaltation, and hath
threatened condemnation to men exalted; and then iniquity of our heel shall never compass
us.
8. There are some who rely on their friends, others rely on their virtue, others on their
riches. This is the presumption of mankind which relieth not on God. He hath spoken of
virtue, he hath spoken of riches, he speaketh of friends. “Brother redeemeth not,1625 shall
man redeem?” (ver. 7). Dost thou expect that man shall redeem thee from the wrath to
come? If brother redeem thee not, shall man redeem thee? Who is the brother, who if He

hath not redeemed thee, no man will redeem? It is He who said after His resurrection, “Go,
tell My brethren.”1626 Our Brother He hath willed to be: and when we say to God, “Our
Father,” this is manifested in us. For he that saith to God, “Our Father;” saith to Christ,
“Brother.”1627 Therefore let him that hath God for his Father and Christ for his Brother,
not fear in the evil day. “For the iniquity of his heel shall not compass him;” for he relieth
not on his virtue, nor glorieth in the abundance of his riches, nor vaunteth himself of his
powerful friends. Let him rely on Him who died for him, that he might not die eternally:
who for his sake was humbled, in order that he might be exalted; who sought him ungodly,
in order that He might be sought by him faithful. Therefore if He redeem not, shall man
redeem? Shall any man redeem, if the Son of man redeem not? If Christ redeem not, shall
Adam redeem? “Brother redeemeth not, shall man redeem?”1628
9. “He shall not give to God his propitiation, and the price of the redemption of his
soul” (ver. 8). He trusteth in his virtue, and in the abundance of his riches doth glory, who
“shall not give to God his propitiation:” that is, satisfaction whereby he may prevail with
God for his sins: “nor the price of the redemption of his soul,” who relieth on his virtue,
and on his friends, and on his riches. But who are they that give the price of the redemption
of their souls? They to whom the Lord saith, “Make to yourselves friends of the Mammon
of unrighteousness, that they may receive you into everlasting habitations.”1629 They give
the price of the redemption of their soul who cease not to do almsdeeds. So those whom
the Apostle chargeth by Timothy he would not have to be proud, lest they should glory in
the abundance of their riches. Lastly, what they possessed he would not have to grow old in
their hands: but that something should be made of it to be for the price of the redemption
of their souls. For he saith, “Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-
minded: nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things
to enjoy.”1630 And as if they had said, “What shall we then make of our riches?” he contin-
ueth, “Let them be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate,”1631
and they will not lose that. How know we? Hear what followeth. “Let them lay up for
themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true
life.”1632 So shall they give the price of the redemption of their soul. And our Lord counselleth
this: “Make for yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,

where thief approacheth not, neither moth corrupteth.”1633 God would not have thee lose
thy wealth, but He hath given thee counsel to change the place thereof. Let your love under-
stand. Suppose thy friend were just now to enter thy house, and find thou hadst placed thy
store of grain in a damp place, and he knew the natural proneness of grain to decay, which
thou perchance knewest not, he would give thee counsel of this sort, saying, “Brother, thou
art losing what with great toil thou hast gathered, thou hast placed it in a damp place, in a
few days this grain will decay.” “And what am I to do, brother? “Raise it into a higher place.”
Thou wouldest hearken to thy friend suggesting that thou shouldest raise grain from a lower
to a higher chamber, and dost thou not hearken to Christ charging thee to lift thy treasure
from earth to heaven, where not what thou keepest in store may be paid to thee, but that
thou mayest keep in store earth, mayest receive heaven, mayest keep in store things mortal,
mayest receive things everlasting, that while thou lendest Christ to receive at thy hands but
a small loan upon earth, He may repay thee a great recompense in Heaven? Nevertheless,
they whom “the iniquity of their heel shall compass,” because they trust in their virtue, and
in the abundance of their riches do glory, and rely on human friends who are able to help
them in nothing, “shall not give to God their propitiation, and the price of the redemption
of their souls.”
10. And what hath he said of such a man? “Yea, he hath laboured for ever, and shall live
till the end” (ver. 9). His labour shall be without end, his life shall have an end. Wherefore
saith he, “He shall live till the end”? Because such men think life to be nought but daily en-
joyments. So when many poor and needy men of our times, unstable, and not looking to
what God doth promise them for their labours, see rich men in daily feastings, in the
splendour and glitter of gold and of silver, they say what? “These are the only people;1634
they really live!” This is a saying, be it said no longer: we both warn you, and it remains to
warn you, that it be said by fewer persons than it would be said, if we had not warned you.
For we do not presume to say that we so say these words, as that it be not said, but that it
be said by fewer persons: for it will be said even unto the end of the world. It is too little that
he saith, “he liveth;” he addeth and saith, he thundereth, thinkest thou that he alone liveth?
Let him live! his life will be ended: because he giveth not the price of the redemption of his
soul, his life will end, his labour will not end. “He laboured for ever, and shall live till the
end.” How shall he live till the end? As he lived that was “clothed with purple and fine linen,
and fared sumptuously every day,”1635 who, being proud and puffed up, spurned the man
full of sores lying before his gate, whose sores the dogs licked, and who longed for the crumbs
which fell from his table. What did those riches profit him? Both changed places: the one
1633 Luke xii. 33.
1634 Soli sunt isti.
1635 Luke xvi. 19.
Part 1
was borne from the rich man’s gate into Abraham’s bosom, the other from his rich feasts
was cast into the fire; the one was in peace, the other burned; the one was sated, the other
thirsted; the one had laboured till the end, but he lived for ever; the other had lived till the
end, but he laboured for ever. And what did it profit the rich man, who asked, while lying
in torments in hell, that a drop of water should be poured upon his tongue from the finger
of Lazarus, saying, “For I am burning here in this flame,”1636 and it was not granted to him?
One longed for the drop from the finger, as the other had for the crumbs from the rich
man’s table; but the labour of the one is ended, and the life of the other is ended: the labour
of this is for ever, the life of that is for ever. We who labour perchance here on the earth,
have not our life here: and shall not be so placed hereafter, for our life shall be Christ for
ever: while they who “will” have their life here, shall labour for ever and live till the end.
11. “For he shall not see death, though he shall have seen wise men dying” (ver. 10).
The man who laboured for ever and shall live till the end, “shall not see death, though he
shall have seen wise men dying.” What is this? He shall not comprehend what death is,
whenever he shall have seen wise men dying. For he saith to himself, “this fellow, for all he
was wise and dwelled with wisdom and worshipped God with piety, is he not dead? Therefore
I will enjoy myself while I live; for if they that are wise in other respects, could do anything,
they would not have died.” Just as the Jews saw Christ hanging on the Cross and despised
Him, saying, “If this Man were the Son of God, He would come down from the Cross:”1637
not seeing what death is. If they had seen what death is; if they had seen, I say.1638 He died
for a time, that He might live again for ever: they lived for a time, that they might die for
ever. But because they saw Him dying, they saw not death, that is to say, they understood
not what was very death. What say they even in Wisdom? “Let us condemn Him with a
most shameful death, for by His own sayings He shall be respected;”1639 for if he is indeed
the Son of God, He will deliver Him from the hands of His adversaries: He will not suffer
His Son to die, if He is truly His Son. But when they saw themselves insulting Him upon
the Cross, and Him not descending from the Cross, they said, He was indeed but a Man.
Thus was it spoken: and surely He could have come down from the Cross, He that could
rise again from the tomb: but He taught us to bear with those who insult us; He taught us
to be patient of the tongues of men, to drink now the cup of bitterness, and afterwards to
receive everlasting salvation.…

Fathers. St. James (v. 6) seems to refer to this passage.”—C.]
Part 1
12. “The imprudent and unwise shall perish together.” Who is “the imprudent”? He
that looketh not out for himself for the future. Who is “the unwise”? He that perceiveth not
in what evil case he is. But do thou perceive in what evil case thou art now, and look out
that thou be in a good case for the future. By perceiving in what evil case thou art, thou wilt
not be unwise: by looking out for thyself for the future, thou wilt not be imprudent. Who
is he that looketh out for himself? That servant to whom his master gave what he should
expend, and afterwards said to him, “Thou canst not be my steward, give an account of thy
stewardship;” and who answered, “What shall I do? I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed;”1640
had, nevertheless, by even his master’s goods made to himself friends, who might receive
him when he was put out of his stewardship. Now he cheated his master in order that he
might get to himself friends to receive him: fear not thou lest thou be cheating, the Lord
Himself exhorteth thee to do so: He saith Himself to thee, “Make to thyself friends of the
mammon of unrighteousness.”1641 Perhaps what thou hast got, thou hast gotten of unright-
eousness: or perhaps this very thing is unrighteousness, that thou hast and another hath
not, thou aboundest and another needeth. Of this mammon of unrighteousness, of these
riches which the unrighteous call riches, make to thyself friends, and thou shalt be prudent:
thou art gaining for thyself, and art not cheating. For now thou seemest to lose it. Wilt thou
lose it if thou place it in a treasury? For boys, my brethren, no sooner find some money,
wherewith to buy something, than they put it in a money-box,1642 which they open not
until afterwards: do they, because they see not what they have got, on that account lose it?
Fear not: boys put in a money-box, and are secure: dost thou place it in the hand of Christ,
and fear? Be prudent, and provide for thyself against the future in Heaven. Be therefore
prudent, copy the ant, as saith the Scripture:1643 “Store in summer, lest thou hunger in
winter;” the winter is the last day, the day of tribulation; the winter is the day of offences
and of bitterness: gather what may be there for thee for the future: but if thou doest not so,
thou wilt perish both imprudent and unwise.
13. But that rich man1644 too died, and a like funeral was made for him. See to what
men have brought themselves: they regard not what a wicked life he led while he lived, but
what pomp followed him when he died! O happy he, whom so many lament! But the other
lived in such sort, that few lament. For all ought to lament a man living so sadly. But there
is the funeral train; he is received in a costly tomb, he is wound in costly robes, he is buried
in perfumes and spices. Secondly, what a monument he hath! How marbled! Doth he live

in that same monument? He is therein dead. Men deeming these to be good things, have
strayed from God, and have not sought the true good things, and have been deceived with
the false. To this end see what followeth. He who gave not the price of the redemption of
his soul, who understood not death, because he saw wise men dying, he became imprudent
and unwise, in order that he might die with them. And how shall they perish, who “shall
leave their riches to aliens”?…
14. But do those same aliens indeed serve them who are called their own? Hear in what
they serve them, observe how they are ridiculed: why hath he said, “to strangers”? Because
they can do them no good. Nevertheless, wherein do they seem to themselves to do good?
“And their tombs shall be their house for ever” (ver. 11). Now because these tombs are
erected, the tombs are a house. For often thou hearest a rich man saying, I have a house of
marble which I must quit, and I think not for myself of an eternal house, where I shall alway
be. When he thinketh to make for himself a monument of marble or of sculpture, he is
deeming as it were of an eternal house: as if therein this rich man would abide! If he would
abide there, he would not burn in hell. We must consider that the place where the spirit of
an evil doer abideth, is not where the mortal body is laid: but “their tombs shall be their
house for ever. Their dwelling places are from generation to generation.” “Dwelling places”
are wherein they abode for a season: “house” is wherein they will abide as it were for ever,
that is to say, their tombs. Thus they leave their dwelling places, where they abode while
they lived, to their families, and they pass as it were to everlasting houses, to their tombs.
What profit to them are “their dwelling places, from generation to generation”? Now suppose
a generation and generation are sons, grandsons there will be, and great grandsons; what
do their dwelling places, what do they profit them? What? Hear: “they shall invoke their
names in their lands.” What is this? They shall take bread and wine to their tombs, and there
they shall invoke the names of the dead. Dost thou consider how loudly was invoked the
name of the rich man after his death, when men drank them drunk at his monument, and
there came down not one drop upon his own burning tongue? Men minister to their own
belly, not to the ghosts of their friends. The souls of the dead nothing doth reach, but what
they have done of themselves while alive: but if they have done nought of themselves while
alive, nothing doth reach them dead. But what do the survivors? They will but “invoke their
names in their lands.”
15. “And man though he was in honour perceived not, he was compared to the beasts
without sense, and was made like to them” (ver. 12).…They ought, on the contrary, to have
made ready for themselves an eternal house in good works, to have made ready for themselves
everlasting life, to have sent before them expenditure, to have followed their works, to have
ministered to a needy companion, to have given to him with whom they were walking, not
to have despised Christ covered with sores before their gate, who hath said, “Inasmuch as
Part 1
ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.”1645
However, “man being in honour hath not understood.” What is, “being in honour”? Being
made after the image and likeness of God, man is preferred to beasts. For God hath not so
made man as He made a beast: but God hath made man for beasts to minister to: is it to his
strength then, and not to his understanding? Nay. But he “understood not;” and he who
was made after the image of God, “is compared to the beasts without sense, and is made
like unto them.” Whence it is said elsewhere, “Be ye not like to horse and mule, in which
there is no understanding.”1646
16. “This their own way is an offence to them” (ver. 13). Be it an offence to them, not
to thee. But when will it be so to thee too? If thou thinkest such men to be blessed. If thou
perceivest that they be not blessed, their own way will be an offence to themselves; not to
Christ, not to His Body, not to His members. “And afterwards they shall bless with their
mouth.” What meaneth, “Afterwards they shall bless with their mouth”? Though they have
become such, that they seek nothing but temporal goods, yet they become hypocrites: and
when they bless God, with lips they bless, and not with heart. Christians like these, when to
them eternal life is commended, and they are told, that in the name of Christ they ought to
be despisers1647 of riches, do make grimaces in their hearts: and if they dare not do it with
open face, lest they blush, or lest they should be rebuked by men, yet they do it in heart, and
scorn; and there remaineth in their mouth blessing, and in their heart cursing.

Part 1
The Second Part.
1. “Like sheep laid in hell, death is their shepherd” (ver. 14). Whose? Of those whose
way is a stumbling-block to themselves. Whose? Of those who mind only things present,
while they think not of things future: of those who think not of any life, but of that which
must be called death. Not without cause, then, like sheep in hell, have they death to their
shepherd. What meaneth, “they have death to their shepherd”? For is death either some
thing or some power? Yea, death is either the separation of the soul from the body, or a
separation of the soul from God,1648 and that indeed which men fear is the separation of
the soul from the body: but the real death, which men do not fear, is the separation of the
soul from God. And ofttimes when men fear that which doth separate the soul from the
body, they fall into that wherein the soul is separated from God. This then is death. But how
is “death their shepherd”? If Christ is life, the devil is death. But we read in many places in
Scripture, how that Christ is life. But the devil is death, not because he is himself death, but
because through him is death. For whether that (death) wherein Adam fell was given man
to drink by the persuasion of him: or whether that wherein the soul is separated from the
body, still they have him for the author thereof, who first falling through pride envied him
who stood, and overthrew him who stood with an invisible death, in order that he might
have to pay1649 the visible death. They who belong to him have death to their shepherd: but
we who think of future immortality, and not without reason do wear the sign of the Cross
of Christ on the forehead, have no shepherd but life. Of unbelievers death is the shepherd,
of believers life is the shepherd. If then in hell are the sheep, whose shepherd is death, in
heaven are the sheep, whose shepherd is life. What then? Are we now in heaven? In heaven
we are by faith. For if not in heaven, where is the “Lift up your heart”? If not in heaven,
whence with the Apostle Paul, “For our conversation is in heaven”?1650 In body we walk
on earth, in heart we dwell in heaven. We dwell there, if thither we send anything which
holdeth us there. For no one dwelleth in heart, save where thought is: but there his thought
is, where his treasure is. He hath treasured on earth, his heart doth not withdraw from earth:
he hath treasured in heaven, his heart from heaven doth not come down: for the Lord saith
plainly, “Where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.” 1651
2. They, then, whose shepherd is death, seem to flourish for a time, and the righteous
to labour: but why? Because it is yet night. What meaneth, it is night? The merits of the
righteous appear not, and the felicity of the unrighteous hath, as it were, a name. So long as
it is winter, grass appeareth more verdant than a tree. For grass flourisheth through the
1648 Oxf. mss. add, “or a separation of the soul from God.”
1649 Al. “destroy him with the visible death.”

Part 2
winter, a tree is as it were dry through the winter: when in summer time the sun hath come
forth with greater heat, the tree, which seemed dry through the winter, is bursting with
leaves, and putteth forth fruits, but the grass withereth: thou wilt see the honour of the tree,
the grass is dried. So also now the righteous labour, before that summer cometh. There is
life in the root, it doth not yet appear in the branches. But our root is love. And what saith
the Apostle? That we ought to have our root above, in order that life may be our shepherd,
because our dwelling ought not to quit heaven, because in this earth we ought to walk as if
dead; so that living above, below we may be dead; not so as that being dead above, we may
live below.…Our labour shall appear in the morning, and there shall be fruit in the morning:
so that they that now labour shall hereafter reign, and they that now boast them and are
proud, shall hereafter be brought under. For what followeth? “Like sheep laid in hell, death
is their shepherd; and the righteous shall reign over them in the morning.”
3. Endure thou the night, yearn for the morning. Think not because the night hath life,
the morning too hath not life. Doth then he that sleepeth live, and he that riseth live not?
Is not he that sleepeth more like death?1652 And who are they that sleep? They whom the
Apostle Paul rouseth, if they choose but to awake. For to certain he saith, “Awake, thou that
sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.”1653 They then that are
lightened by Christ watch now, but the fruit of their watchings appeareth not yet: in the
morning it shall appear, that is, when doubtful things of this world shall have passed away.
For these are very night: for do they not appear to thee like darkness?…But they on whom
men have trampled, and who were ridiculed for believing, shall hear from Life Itself, whom
they have for shepherd, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom which was
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Therefore the righteous “shall reign
over them,” not now, but “in the morning.” Let no one say, Wherefore am I a Christian? I
rule no one,1654 I would rule the wicked. Be not in haste, thou shalt reign, but “in the
morning.” “And the help of them shall grow old in hell from their glory.” Now they have
glory, in hell they shall grow old. What is “the help of them”? Help from money, help from
friends, help from their own might. But when a man shall be dead, “in that day shall perish
all his thoughts.”1655 How great glory he seemed to have among men, while he lived, so
great oldness and decay of punishments shall he have, when he shall be dead in hell.
4. “Nevertheless, God shall redeem my soul” (ver. 15). Behold the voice of one hoping
in the future: “Nevertheless, God shall redeem my soul.”1656 Perhaps it is the voice of one
1652 Or, “a dead person.”

still wishing to be relieved from oppression. Some one is in prison, he saith, “God shall re-
deem my soul:” some one is in bond, “God shall redeem my soul:” some one is suffering
peril by sea, is being tossed by waves and raging tempests, what saith he? “God shall redeem
my soul.” They would be delivered for the sake of this life. Not such is the voice of this man.
Hear what followeth: “God shall redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when He shall have
received me.” He is speaking of this redemption, which Christ now showeth in Himself. For
He hath descended into hell, and hath ascended into heaven. What we have seen in the Head
we have found in the Body. For what we have believed in the Head, they that have seen,
have themselves told us, and by themselves we have seen: “For we are” all “one body.”1657
But are they better that hear, we worse to whom it hath been told? Not so saith The Life Itself,
Our Shepherd Himself. For He rebuketh a certain disciple of His, doubting and desiring to
handle His scars, and when he had handled the scars and had cried out, saying, “My Lord
and my God,”1658 seeing His disciple doubting, and looking to the whole world about to
believe, “Because thou hast seen Me,” He saith, “thou hast believed: blessed are they that
see not, and believe.” “But God shall redeem my soul from the land of hell, when He hath
received me.” Here then what? Labour, oppression, tribulation, temptation: expect nothing
else. Where joy? In future hope.…
5. …Perchance thy heart saith, Wretch that I am, I suppose to no purpose I have believed,
God doth not regard things human. God therefore doth awaken us: and He saith what?
“Fear not, though a man have become rich” (ver. 16). For why didst thou fear, because a
man hath become rich? Thou didst fear that thou hadst believed to no purpose, that per-
chance thou shouldest have lost the labour for thy faith, and the hope of thy conversion:
because perchance there hath come in thy way gain with guilt, and thou couldest have been
rich, if thou hadst seized upon that same gain with the guilt, and neededst not have laboured;
and thou, remembering what God hath threatened, hast refrained from guilt, and hast
contemned the gain: thou seest another man that hath made gain by guilt, and hath suffered
no harm; and thou fearest to be good. “Fear not,” saith the Spirit of God to thee, “though a
man shall have become rich.” Wouldest thou not have eyes but for things present? Things
future He hath promised, who hath risen again; peace in this world, and repose in this life,
He hath not promised. Every man doth seek repose; a good thing he is seeking, but not in
the proper region thereof he is seeking it. There is no peace in this life; in Heaven hath been
promised that which on earth we are seeking: in the world to come hath been promised that
which in this world we are seeking.
6. “Fear not, though a man be made rich, and though the glory of his house be multi-
plied.” Wherefore “fear not”? “For when he shall die, he shall not receive anything” (ver.

Part 2
17). Thou seest him living, consider him dying. Thou markest what he hath here, mark what
he taketh with him. What doth he take with him? He hath store of gold, he hath store of
silver, numerous estates, slaves: he dieth, these remain, he knoweth not for whom. For
though he leaveth them for whom he will, he keepeth them not for whom he will. For many
have gained even what was not left them, and many have lost what was left them. All these
things then remain, and he taketh with him what? Perhaps some one saith, He taketh that
with him in which he is wound, and that which is expended upon him for a costly and
marble tomb, to erect a monument, this he taketh with him. I say, not even this. For these
things are presented to him without his feeling them. If thou deckest a man sleeping and
not awake, he hath the decorations with him on the couch: perhaps the decorations are
resting upon the body of him as he lieth, and perhaps he seeth himself in tatters during
sleep. What he feeleth is more to him than what he feeleth not. Though even this when he
shall have awaked will not be: yet to him sleeping, that which he saw in sleep was more than
that which he felt not. Why then, brethren, should1659 men say to themselves, Let money
be spent at my death: why do I leave my heirs rich? Many things will they have of mine, let
me too have something of my own for my body. What shall a dead body have? what shall
rotting flesh have? what shall flesh not feeling have? If that rich man had anything, whose
tongue was dry, then man hath something of his own. My brethren, do we read in the Gospel,
that this rich man appeared in the fire with all-silken and fine-linen coverings? Was he of
such sort in hell as he was in feastings at table? When he thirsted and desired a drop, all
those things were not there. Therefore man carrieth not with him anything, nor doth the
dead take with him that which the burial taketh. For where feeling is, there is the man; where
is no feeling, the man is not. There lieth fallen the vessel which contained the man, the house
which held the man. The body let us call the house, the spirit let us call the inhabitant of the
house. The spirit is tormented in hell: what doth it profit him, that the body lieth in spices
and perfumes, wound in costly linens? just as if the master of the house should be sent into
banishment, and thou shouldest garnish the walls of his house. He in banishment is in need,
and doth faint with hunger, he scarce findeth to himself one hovel where he may snatch a
sleep, and thou sayest, “Happy is he, for his house hath been garnished.” Who would not
judge that thou wast either jesting or wast mad? Thou dost garnish the body, the spirit is
tormented. Give something to the spirit, and ye have given something to the dead man. But
what wilt thou give him, when he desired one drop, and received not? For the man scorned
to send before him anything. Wherefore scorned? “because this their way is a stumbling-
block to them.”1660 He minded not any but the present life, he thought not but how he
might be buried, wound in costly vestments. His soul was taken from him, as the Lord saith:
1659 Oxf. mss. “do.”
1660 Ps. xlix. 13.
Part 2
“Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be taken from thee, and whose shall those things be
which thou hast provided?”1661 And that is fulfilled which this Psalm saith: “Fear not, though
a man be made rich, and though the glory of his house be multiplied: for when he shall die
he shall not receive anything, nor shall his glory descend together with him.”
7. Let your love observe: “For his soul shall be blessed in his life” (ver. 18). As long as
he lived he did well for himself. This all men say, but say falsely. It is a blessing from the
mind of the blesser, not from the truth itself. For what sayest thou? Because he ate and drank,
because he did what he chose, because he feasted sumptuously, therefore he did well with
himself. I say, he did ill for himself. Not I say, but Christ. He did ill for himself. For that rich
man, when he feasted sumptuously every day, was supposed to do well with himself: but
when he began to burn in hell, then that which was supposed to be well was found to be ill.
For what he had eaten with men above,1662 he digested in hell beneath. Unrighteousness I
mean, brethren, on which he used to feast. He used to eat costly banquets with the mouth
of flesh, with his heart’s mouth he used to eat unrighteousness. What he ate with his heart’s
mouth with men above, this he digested amid those punishments in the places beneath.
And verily he had eaten for a time, he digested ill for everlasting. Is then unrighteousness
eaten? perhaps some one saith: what is it that he saith? Unrighteousness eaten? It is not I
that say: hear the Scripture: “As a sour grape is vexation to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes,
so is unrighteousness to them that use it.”1663 For he that shall have eaten unrighteousness,
that is, he that shall have had unrighteousness wilfully, shall not be able to eat righteousness.
For righteousness is bread. Who is bread? “I am the living bread which came down from
heaven.”1664 Himself is the bread of our heart.…Is then even righteousness eaten? If it were
not eaten, the Lord would not have said, “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness.”1665 Therefore “since his soul shall be blessed in life,” in life it “shall” be
blessed, in death it shall be tormented.…
8. “He shall confess to Thee, when Thou shalt have done him good.” Be not of such sort,
brethren: see ye how that to this end we say these words, to this end we sing, to this end we
treat, to this end toil—do not these things. Your business doth prove you: sometimes in
your business ye hear the truth, and ye blaspheme. The Church ye blaspheme. Wherefore?
Because ye are Christians. “If so it be, I betake myself to Donatus’s party: I will be a hea-
then.”1666 Wherefore? Because thou hast eaten bread, and the teeth are in pain. When thou

sawest the bread itself, thou didst praise; thou beginnest to eat, and the teeth are in pain;
that is, when thou wast hearing the Word of God thou didst praise: when it is said to thee,
“Do this,” thou blasphemest: do not so ill: say this, “The bread is good, but I cannot eat it.”
But now if thou seest with the eyes, thou praisest: when thou beginnest to close the teeth
thou sayest, “Bad is this bread, and like him that made it.” So it cometh to pass that thou
confessest to God, when God doeth thee good and thou liest when thou singest, “I will alway
bless God, His praise is ever in my mouth.”1667 How alway? If alway gain, alway He is
blessed: if sometime there is loss, He is not blessed, but blasphemed. Forsooth thou blessest
alway, forsooth His praise is ever in thy mouth! Thou wilt be such as just now he describeth:
“He will confess to Thee, when Thou shalt have done him good.”
9. “He shall enter even unto the generations of his fathers” (ver. 19): that is, he shall
imitate his fathers. For the unrighteous, that now are, have brothers, have fathers. Unright-
eous men of old, are the fathers of the present; and they that are now unrighteous, are the
fathers of unrighteous posterity: just as the fathers of the righteous, the righteous of old, are
the fathers of the righteous that now are; and they that now are, are the fathers of them that
are to be. The Holy Spirit hath willed to show that righteousness is not evil when men
murmur against her: but these men have their father from the beginning, even to the gener-
ation of their fathers. Two men Adam begat, and in one was unrighteousness, in one was
righteousness: unrighteousness in Cain, righteousness in Abel.1668 Unrighteousness seemed
to prevail over righteousness, because Cain unrighteous slew Abel righteous1669 in the night.
Is it so in the morning? Nay, “but the righteous shall reign over them in the morning.”1670
The morning shall come, and it shall be seen where Abel is, and where Cain. So all men who
are after Cain, and so all who are after Abel, even unto the end of the world. “He shall enter
even unto the generations of his fathers: even to eternity he shall not see light.” Because
even when he was here, he was in darkness, taking pleasure in false goods, and not loving
real goods: even so he shall go hence into hell: from the darkness of his dreams the darkness
of torments shall receive him. Therefore, “even to eternity he shall not see light.”
But wherefore this? What he hath written in the middle of the Psalm,1671 the same also
he hath writ at the end: “Man, though he was in honour, understood not, was compared to
the beasts without sense, and was made like to them” (ver. 20). But ye, brethren, consider
that ye be men made after the image and likeness of God. The image1672 of God is within,

is not in the body; is not in these ears which ye see, and eyes, and nostrils, and palate, and
hands, and feet; but is made nevertheless:1673 wherein is the intellect, wherein is the mind,
wherein the power of discovering truth, wherein is faith, wherein is your hope, wherein
your charity, there God hath His Image: there at least ye perceive and see that these things
pass away; for so he hath said in another Psalm, “Though man walketh in an image, yet he
is disquieted in vain: he heapeth up treasures, and knoweth not for whom he shall gather
them.”1674 Be not disquieted, for of whatsoever kind these things be, they are transitory, if
ye are men who being in honour understand. For if being men in honour ye understand
not, ye are compared to the beasts without sense, and are made like to them.

Psalm L.1675
1. How much availeth the Word of God to us for the correction of our life, both regarding
His rewards to be expected, and His punishments to be feared, let each one measure1676 in
himself; and let him put his conscience without deceit before His eyes, and not flatter himself
in a danger so great: for ye see that even our Lord God Himself doth flatter no one: though
He comforteth us by promising His blessings, and by strengthening our hope; yet them that
live ill and despise His word He assuredly spareth not. Let each one examine himself, while
it is time, and let him see where he is, and either persevere in good, or be changed from evil.
For as he saith in this Psalm, not any man whatever nor any angel whatever, but, “The Lord,
the God of gods, hath spoken” (ver. 1). But in speaking, He hath done what? “He hath called
the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down.” He that “hath called the world
from the rising of the sun unto the going down,” is Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, “the
Word made Flesh,”1677 in order that He might dwell in us. Our Lord Jesus Christ then is
the “God of gods;” because by Himself were all things made, and without Himself was
nothing made. The Word of God, if He is God, is truly the God of gods; but whether He be
God the Gospel answereth, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.”1678 And if all things were made by Himself, as He saith in the sequel,
then if any were made gods, by Himself were they made. For the one God was not made,
and He is Himself alone truly God. But Himself the only God, Father and Son and Holy
Ghost, is one God.
2. But then who are those gods, or where are they, of whom God is the true God? An-
other Psalm saith, “God hath stood in the synagogue of gods, but in the midst He judgeth
gods.”1679 As yet we know not whether perchance any gods be congregated in heaven, and
in their congregation, for this is “in the synagogue,” God hath stood to judge. See in the
same Psalm those to whom he saith, “I have said, Ye are gods, and children of the Highest
all; but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.”1680 It is evident then, that He
hath called men gods, that are deified of His Grace, not born of His Substance. For He doth
justify, who is just through His own self, and not of another; and He doth deify who is God
through Himself, not by the partaking of another. But He that justifieth doth Himself deify,
in that by justifying He doth make sons of God. “For He hath given them power to become
the sons of God.”1681 If we have been made sons of God, we have also been made gods: but

this is the effect of Grace adopting, not of nature generating. For the only Son of God, God,
and one God with the Father, Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, was in the beginning the
Word, and the Word with God, the Word God. The rest that are made gods, are made by
His own Grace, are not born of His Substance, that they should be the same as He, but that
by favour they should come to Him, and be fellow-heirs with Christ. For so great is the love
in Him the Heir, that He hath willed to have fellow-heirs. What covetous man would will
this, to have fellow-heirs? But even one that is found so to will, will share with them the in-
heritance, the sharer having less himself, than if he had possessed alone: but the inheritance
wherein we are fellow-heirs of Christ, is not lessened by multitude of possessors, nor is it
made narrower by the number of fellow-heirs: but is as great for many as it is for few, as
great for individuals as for all. “See,” saith the Apostle, “what love God hath bestowed upon
us, that we should be called, and be, the sons of God.”1682 And in another place, “Dearly
beloved, we are the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be.” We are
therefore in hope, not yet in substance. “But we know,” he saith, “that when He shall have
appeared, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.”1683 The Only Son is like Him
by birth, we like by seeing. For we are not like in such sort as He, who is the same as He is
by whom He was begotten: for we are like, not equal: He, because equal, is therefore like.
We have heard who are the gods that being made are justified, because they are called the
sons of God: and who are the gods that are not Gods, to whom the God of gods is terrible?
For another Psalm saith, “He is terrible over all gods.” 1684 And as if thou shouldest enquire,
what gods? He saith, “For all the gods of the nations are devils.” To the gods of the nations,
to the devils, terrible: to the gods made by Himself, to sons, lovely. Furthermore, I find both
of them confessing the Majesty of God, both the devils confessed Christ, and the faithful
confessed Christ. “Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God,”1685 said Peter. “We know
who Thou art, Thou art the Son of God,”1686 said the devils. A like confession I hear, but
like love I find not; nay even here love, there fear. To whom therefore He is lovely, the same
are sons; to whom He is terrible, are not sons; to whom He is lovely, the same He hath made
gods; those to whom He is terrible He doth prove not to be gods. For these are made gods,
those are reputed gods; these Truth maketh gods, those error doth so account.
3. “The God,” therefore, “of gods, the Lord hath spoken”1687 (ver. 1). Hath spoken many
ways. By Angels He hath Himself spoken, by Prophets He hath Himself spoken, by His own

mouth He hath Himself spoken, by His faithful He doth Himself speak, by our lowliness,
when we say anything true, He doth Himself speak. See then, by speaking diversely, many
ways, by many vessels, by many instruments, yet He doth Himself sound everywhere, by
touching, moulding, inspiring: see what He hath done. For “He hath spoken, and hath called
the world.” What world? Africa, perhaps! for the sake of those that say, the Church of Christ
is the portion of Donatus. Africa indeed alone He hath not called, but even Africa He hath
not severed. For He that “hath called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going
down,” leaving out no parts that He hath not called, in His calling hath found Africa. Let it
rejoice therefore in unity, not pride itself in division. We say well, that the voice of the God
of gods hath come even into Africa, hath not stayed in Africa. For “He hath called the world
from the rising of the sun unto the going down.” There is no place where may lurk the
conspiracies of heretics, they have no place wherein they may hide themselves under the
shadow of falsehood; for “there is none that can hide himself from the heat thereof.”1688
He that hath called the world, hath called even the whole world: He that hath called the
world, hath called as much as He hath formed. Why do false christs and false prophets rise
up against me? why is it that they strive to ensnare me with captious words, saying, “Lo!
here is Christ, Lo! He is there!”1689 I hear not them that point out portions: the God of gods
hath pointed out the whole: “He” that “hath called the world from the rising of the sun unto
the going down,” hath redeemed the whole; but hath condemned them that lay false claim
to1690 portions.
4. But we have heard the world called from the rising of the sun unto the going down:
whence doth He begin to call, who hath called? This thing also hear ye: “Out of Sion is the
semblance of His beauty” (ver. 2). Evidently the Psalm doth agree with the Gospel, which
saith, “Throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”1691 Hear, “Throughout all nations:”
He hath called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down.” Hear, “Beginning
at Jerusalem:” “Out of Sion is the semblance of His beauty.” Therefore, “He hath called the
world from the rising of the sun unto the going down,” agreeth with the words of the Lord,
who saith, “It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that re-
pentance and remission of sins should be preached in His Name throughout all nations.”1692
For all nations are from the rising of the sun unto the going down. But that, “Out of Sion
is the semblance of His beauty,” that thence beginneth the beauty of His Gospel, that thence
He began to be preached, being “beautiful in form beyond the sons of men,”1693 agreeth

with the words of the Lord, who saith, “Beginning at Jerusalem.” New things are in tune
with old, old things with new: the two Seraphim say to one another, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord
God of Sabaoth.”1694 The two Testaments are both in tune, and the two Testaments have
one voice: let the voice of the Testaments in tune be heard, not that of pretenders disinherited.
This thing then hath the God of gods done, “He hath called the world from the rising of the
sun unto the going down, His semblance going before out of Sion.” For in that place were
His disciples,1695 who received the Holy Ghost sent from heaven on the fiftieth day after
His resurrection. Thence the Gospel, thence the preaching, thence the whole world filled,
and that in the Grace of Faith.
5. For when the Lord Himself had come, because He came to suffer, He came hidden:
and though He was strong in Himself, He appeared in the flesh weak. For He must needs
appear in order that He might not be perceived; be despised, in order that He might be slain.
There was semblance of glory in divinity, but it lay concealed in flesh. “For if they had
known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.”1696 So then He walked hidden
among the Jews, among His enemies, doing marvels, suffering ills, until He was hanged on
the tree, and the Jews seeing Him hanging both despised Him the more, and before the
Cross wagging their heads they said, “If He be the Son of God, let Him come down from
the Cross.”1697 Hidden then was the God of gods, and He gave forth words more out of
compassion for us than out of His own majesty. For whence, unless assumed from us, were
those words, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”1698 But when hath the
Father forsaken the Son, or the Son the Father? Are not Father and Son one God? Whence
then, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me,” save that in the Flesh of infirmity
there was acknowledged the voice of a sinner? For as He took upon Him the likeness of the
flesh of sin,1699 why should He not take upon Him the voice of sin? Hidden then was the
God of gods, both when He walked among men, and when He hungered, and when He
thirsted, and when fatigued He sat, and when with wearied body He slept, and when taken,
and when scourged, and when standing before the judge, and when He made answer to him
in his pride, “Thou couldest have no power against Me, except it had been given thee from
above;”1700 and while led as a victim “before His shearer He opened not His mouth,”1701

and while crucified, and while buried, He was always hidden God of gods. What took place
after He rose again? The disciples marvelled, and at first believed not, until they touched
and handled.1702 But flesh had risen, because flesh had been dead: Divinity which could
not die, even still lay hid in the flesh of Him rising. Form could be seen, limbs held, scars
handled: the Word by whom all things were made, who doth see? who doth hold? who doth
handle? And yet “the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us.”1703 And Thomas, that
was holding Man, understood God as he was able. For when he had handled the scars, he
cried out, “My Lord, and my God.” Yet the Lord was showing that form, and that flesh,
which they had seen upon the Cross, which had been laid in the sepulchre. He stayed with
them forty days.…But what was said to Thomas handling? “Because thou hast seen, thou
hast believed; blessed are they that see not, and believe.” 1704 We are foretold. That world
called from the rising of the sun unto the going down seeth not, and believeth. Hidden then
is the God of gods, both to those among whom He walked, and to those by whom He was
crucified, and to those before whose eyes He rose, and to us who believe on Him in heaven
sitting, whom we have not seen on earth walking. But even if we were to see, should we not
see that which the Jews saw and crucified? It is more, that not seeing we believe Christ to
be God, than that they seeing deemed Him only to be man. They in a word by thinking evil
slew, we by believing well are made alive.
6. What then, brethren? This God of gods, both then hidden, and now hidden, shall He
ever be hidden? Evidently not: hear what followeth: “God shall come manifest” (ver. 3). He
that came hidden, shall come manifest. Hidden He came to be judged, manifest He shall
come to judge: hidden He came that He might stand before a judge, manifest He shall come
that He may be judge even of judges: “He shall come manifest, and shall not be silent.” But
why? Is He now silent? And whence are all the words that we say? whence those precepts?
whence those warnings? whence that trumpet of terror? He is not silent, and is silent: is not
silent from warning, is silent from avenging: is not silent from precept, is silent from judg-
ment. For He suffereth sinners daily doing evil things, not caring for God, not in their con-
science, not in heaven, not in earth: all these things escape Him not, and universally He
doth admonish all; and whenever He chastiseth any on earth, it is admonition, not yet
condemnation. He is silent then from judgment, He is hidden in heaven, as yet He interce-
deth for us: He is long-suffering to sinners, not putting forth His wrath, but awaiting penit-
ence. He saith in another place: “I have held my peace, shall I always hold my peace?”1705
When then He shall not hold His peace, “God shall come manifest.” What God? “Our God.”

Psalm L
And the God Himself, who is our God: for he is not God, who is not our God. For the gods
of the nations are devils: the God of Christians is very God. Himself shall come, but “mani-
fest,” not still to be mocked, not still to be buffeted and scourged: He shall come, but
“manifest,” not still to be smitten with a reed upon the head, not still to be crucified, slain,
buried: for all these things God being hidden hath willed to suffer. “He shall come manifest,
and shall not be silent.”
7. But that He shall come to judgment, the following words teach. “Fire shall go before
Him.”1706 Do we fear? Be we changed, and we shall not fear. Let chaff fear the fire: what
doth it to gold? What thou mayest do is now in thy power, so thou mayest not experience,
for want of being corrected, that which is to come even against thy will. For if we might so
bring it about, brethren, that the day of judgment should not come; I think that even then
it were not for us to live ill. If the fire of the day of judgment were not to come, and over
sinners there impended only separation from the face of God, in whatever affluence of de-
lights they might be, not seeing Him by whom they were created, and separated from that
sweetness of His ineffable1707 countenance, in whatever eternity and impunity of sin, they
ought to bemoan themselves. But what shall I say, or to whom shall I say? This is a punish-
ment to lovers, not to despisers. They that have begun to feel in any degree the sweetness
of wisdom and truth, know what I say, how great a punishment it is to be only separated
from the face of God: but they that have not tasted that sweetness, if not yet they yearn for
the face of God, let them fear even fire; let punishments terrify those, whom rewards win
not. Of no value to thee is what God promiseth, tremble at what He threateneth. The
sweetness of His presence shall come; thou art not changed, thou art not awakened, thou
sighest not, thou longest not: thou embracest thy sins and the delights of thy flesh, thou art
heaping stubble to thyself, the fire will come. “Fire shall burn in His presence.” This fire will
not be like thy hearth-fire, into which nevertheless, if thou art compelled to thrust thy hand,
thou wilt do whatsoever he would have thee who doth threaten this alternative. If he say to
thee, “write against the life1708 of thy father, write against the lives of thy children, for if
thou do not, I thrust thy hand into thy fire:” thou wilt do it in order that thy hand be not
burned, in order that thy member be not burned for a time, though it is not to be ever in
pain. Thine enemy threateneth then but so light an evil, and thou doest evil; God threateneth
eternal evil, and doest thou not good? To do evil not even menaces should compel thee:
from doing good not even menaces should deter thee. But by the menaces of God, by menaces
of everlasting fire, thou art dissuaded from evil, invited to good. Wherefore doth it grieve

Psalm L
thee, except because thou believest not? Let each one then examine his heart, and see what
faith doth1709 hold there. If we believe a judgment to come, brethren, let us live well. Now
is time of mercy, then will be time of judgment. No one will say, “Call me back to my former
years.” Even then men will repent, but will repent in vain: now let there be repentance, while
there is fruit of repentance; now let there be applied to the roots of the tree a basket of
dung,1710 sorrow of heart, and tears; lest He come and pluck up by the roots. For when He
shall have plucked up, then the fire is to be looked for. Now, even if the branches have been
broken, they can again be grafted in:1711 then, “every tree which bringeth not forth good
fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.”1712 “Fire shall burn in His presence.”
8. “And a mighty tempest round about Him” (ver. 3). “A mighty tempest,” in order to
winnow so great a floor. In this tempest shall be that winnowing whereby from the saints
shall be put away everything impure, from the faithful every unreality; from godly men and
them that fear the Word of God, every scorner and every proud man. For now a sort of
mixture doth lie there, from the rising of the sun unto the going down. Let us see then how
He will do that is to come, what He will do with that tempest which “shall be a mighty
tempest round about Him.” Doubtless this tempest is to make a sort of separation. It is that
separation which they waited not for, who brake the nets, before they came to land.1713 But
in this separation there is made a sort of distinction between good men and bad men. There
be some that now follow Christ with lightened shoulders without the load of the world’s
cares, who have not heard in vain, “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow Me;”1714 to which
sort is said, “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”1715 Some
then shall be judging with the Lord: but others to be judged, but to be placed on the right
hand. For that there will be certain judging with the Lord, we have most evident testimony,
which I have but now quoted: “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel.”…
9. But what the Lord did after His resurrection, signified what is to be to us after our
resurrection, in that number of the kingdom of heaven, where shall be no bad man.…Lastly,
those seven thousand of whom reply was made to Elias, “I have left me seven thousand men
that have not bowed knees before Baal,”1716 far exceed that number of fishes. Therefore the
1709 Al. “he doth.”

Psalm L
hundred and fifty-three fishes1717 doth not alone express just such a number of saints, but
Scripture doth express the whole number of saints and righteous men by so great a number
for a particular reason; to wit, in order that in those hundred and fifty-three all may be un-
derstood that pertain to the resurrection to eternal life. For the Law hath ten command-
ments:1718 but the Spirit of Grace, through which alone the Law is fulfilled,1719 is called
sevenfold. The number then must be examined, what mean ten and seven: ten in command-
ments, seven in the grace of the Holy Spirit: by which grace the commandments are fulfilled.
Ten then and seven contain all that pertain to the resurrection, to the right hand, to the
kingdom of heaven, to life eternal, that is, they that fulfil the Law by the Grace of the Spirit,
not as it were by their own work or their own merit. But ten and seven, if thou countest
from one unto seventeen, by adding all the numbers by steps, so that to one thou mayest
add two, add three, add four, that they may become ten, by adding five that they may become
fifteen, by adding six that they may become twenty-one, by adding seven that they may be-
come twenty-eight, by adding eight that they may become thirty-six, by adding nine that
they may become forty-five, by adding ten that they may become fifty-five, by adding eleven
that they may become sixty-six, by adding twelve that they may become seventy-eight, by
adding thirteen that they may become ninety-one, by adding fourteen that they may become
one hundred and five, by adding fifteen that they may become one hundred and twenty, by
adding sixteen that they may become one hundred and thirty-six, by adding seventeen,
make up one hundred and fifty-three, thou wilt find a vast number of all saints to belong
to this number of a few fishes. In like manner then as in five virgins, countless virgins; as in
five brethren of him that was tormented in hell, thousands of the people of the Jews; as in
the number of one hundred and fifty-three fishes, thousands of thousands of saints: so in
twelve thrones, not twelve men, but great is the number of the perfect.1720
10. But I see what is next required of us; in like manner as in the case of the five virgins,
a reason was given why many should belong to five, and why to those five many Jews, and
why to a hundred and fifty-three many perfect—to show why and how to the twelve thrones
not twelve men, but many belong. What mean the twelve thrones, which signify all men

Psalm L
everywhere that have been enabled to be so perfect as they must be perfect, to whom it is
said, “Ye shall sit over the twelve tribes of Israel”?1721 And why do all men everywhere belong
to the number twelve? Because the very “everywhere” which we say, we say of the whole
world: but the compass of lands is contained in four particular quarters, East, West, South,
and North: from all these quarters they being called in the Trinity and made perfect in the
faith and precept of the Trinity,—seeing that three times four are twelve, ye perceive
wherefore the saints belong to the whole world; they that shall sit upon twelve thrones to
judge the twelve tribes of Israel, since the twelve tribes of Israel, also, are the twelve tribes
of the whole of Israel. For like as they that are to judge are from the whole world, so also
they that are to be judged are from the whole world. The Apostle Paul of himself, when he
was reproving believing laymen, because they referred not their causes to the Church, but
dragged them with whom they had matters before the public, said, “Know ye not that we
shall judge Angels?” 1722 See after what sort He hath made Himself judge: not only himself,
but also all that judge aright in the Church.
11. Since then it is evident, that many are to judge with the Lord, but that others are to
be judged, not however on equality, but according to their deserts; He will come with all
His Angels,1723 when before Him shall be gathered all nations, and among all the Angels
are to be reckoned those that have been made so perfect, that sitting upon twelve thrones
they judge the twelve tribes of Israel. For men are called Angels: the Apostle saith of himself,
“As an angel of God ye received me.”1724 Of John Baptist it is said, “Behold, I send My Angel
before Thy face, that shall prepare Thy way before Thee.”1725 Therefore, coming with all
Angels, together with Him He shall have the Saints also. For plainly saith Isaias also, “He
shall come to judgment with the elders of the people.”1726 Those “elders of the people,”
then, those but now named Angels, those thousands of many men made perfect coming
from the whole world, are called Heaven. But the others are called earth, yet fruitful. Which
is the earth that is fruitful? That which is to be set on the right hand, unto which it shall be
said, “I was an hungred, and ye gave Me to eat:”1727 truly fruitful earth in which the Apostle
doth joy, when they sent to him to supply his necessities: “Not because I ask a gift,” he saith,
“but I require fruit.”1728 And he giveth thanks, saying, “Because at length ye have budded

forth again to be thoughtful for me.”1729 He saith, “Ye have budded forth again,” as to trees
which had withered away with a kind of barrenness. Therefore the Lord coming to judgment
(that we may now hear the Psalm, brethren), He will do what? “He will call the heaven from
above” (ver. 4). The heaven, all the Saints, those made perfect that shall judge, them He shall
call from above, to be sitters with Him to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. For how shall “He
call the heaven from above,” when the heaven is always above? But those that He here calleth
heaven, the same elsewhere He calleth heavens. What heavens? That tell out the glory of
God: for, “The heavens tell out the glory of God:”1730 whereof is said, “Into all the earth
their sound hath gone forth, and into the ends of the world their words.” For see the Lord
severing in judgment: “He shall call the heaven from above and the earth, to sever His
people.” From whom but from evil men? Of whom here afterwards no mention is made,
now as it were condemned to punishment. See these good men, and distinguish. “He shall
call the heaven from above, and the earth, to sever His people.” He calleth the earth also,
not however to be associated, but to be dissociated. For at first He called them together,
“when the God of gods spake and called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going
down,” He had not yet severed: those servants had been sent to bid to the marriage,1731 who
had gathered good and bad. But when the God of gods shall come manifest and shall not
keep silence, He shall so call the “heaven from above” that it may judge with Him. For what
the heaven is, the heavens themselves are; just as what the earth is, the lands themselves,
just as what the Church is, the Churches themselves: “He shall call the heaven from above,
and the earth, to sever His people.” Now with the heaven He severeth the earth, that is, the
heaven with Him doth sever the earth. How doth He sever the earth? In such sort that He
setteth on the right hand some, others on the left. But to the earth severed, He saith what?
“Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom which was prepared for you from the
beginning of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me to eat,” and so forth. But they
say, “When saw we Thee an hungred?” And He, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
the least of Mine, ye have done it unto Me.” 1732 “He shall call therefore the heaven from
above, and the earth, to sever His people.”
12. “Gather to Him His righteous” (ver. 5). The voice divine and prophetic, seeing future
things as if present doth exhort the Angels gathering. For He shall send His Angels, and
1729 Phil. iv. 10.
1730 Ps. xix. 1.
1731 Matt. xxii. 3.
1732 Matt. xxv. 34, etc.
Psalm L
before Him shall be gathered all nations.1733 Gather to Him His righteous. What righteous
men save those that live of faith and do works of mercy? For those works are works of
righteousness. Thou hast the Gospel: “Beware of doing your righteousness before men to
be seen of them.”1734 And as if it were inquired, What righteousness? “When therefore thou
doest alms,” He saith. Therefore alms He hath signified to be works of righteousness. Those
very persons gather for His righteous: gather those that have had compassion on the “needy,”
that have considered the needy and poor:1735 gather them, “The Lord preserve them, and
make them to live;” “Gather to Him His righteous: who order His covenant above sacrifices:”
that is, who think of His promises above those things which they work. For those things are
sacrifices, God saying, “I will have mercy more than sacrifice.”1736 “Who keep His covenant
more than sacrifice.”
13. “And the Heaven shall declare His righteousness” (ver. 6). Truly this righteousness
of God to us the “heavens have declared,” the Evangelists have foretold. Through them we
have heard that some will be on the right hand, to whom the Householder saith, “Come, ye
blessed of My Father, receive.”1737 Receive what? “A kingdom.” In return for what thing?
“I was an hungred, and ye gave Me to eat.” What so valueless, what so earthly, as to break
bread to the hungry? At so much is valued the kingdom of heaven. “Break thy bread to the
hungry, and the needy without covering bring into thy house; if thou seest one naked, clothe
him.”1738 If thou hast not the means of breaking bread, hast not house into which thou
mayest bring, hast not garment wherewith thou mayest cover: give a cup of cold water,1739
cast two mites into the treasury.1740 As much the widow doth buy with two mites, as Peter
buyeth, by leaving the nets,1741 as Zacchæus buyeth by giving half his goods.1742 Of so much
worth is all that thou hast. “The heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God is Judge.”
Truly judge not confounding but severing. For “the Lord knoweth them that are His.”1743
Even if grains lie hid in the chaff, they are known to the husbandman. Let no one fear that
he is a grain even among the chaff; the eyes of our winnower are not deceived. Fear not lest

that tempest, which shall be round about Him, should confound thee with chaff. Certainly
mighty will be the tempest; yet not one grain will it sweep from the side of the corn to the
chaff: because not any rustic with three-pronged fork, but God, Three in One, is Judge. And
the heavens shall declare His righteousness: for God is Judge. Let heavens go, let the heavens
tell, into every land let their sound go out, and unto the ends of the world their words:1744
and let that body say, “From the ends of the world unto Thee have I cried, when my heart
was in heaviness.”1745 For now mingled it groaneth, divided it shall rejoice. Let it cry then
and say, “Destroy not my soul with ungodly men, and with men of blood my life.”1746 He
destroyeth not together, because God is Judge. Let it cry to Him and say, “Judge me, O Lord,
and sever my cause from the nation unholy:”1747 let it say, He shall do it: there shall be
gathered to Him His righteous ones. He hath called the earth that He may sever His people.
14. “Hear, my people, and I will speak to thee” (ver. 7). He shall come and shall not keep
silence; see how that even now, if ye hear, He is not silent. Hear, my people, and I will speak
to thee. For if thou hearest not, I will not speak to thee. “Hear, and I will speak to thee.” For
if thou hearest not, even though I shall speak, it will not be to thee. When then shall I speak
to thee? If thou hearest. When hearest thou? If thou art my people. For, “Hear, my people:”
thou hearest not if thou art an alien people. “Hear, my people, and I will speak to thee: Israel,
and I will testify to thee.”…For “Thy God,” is properly said to that man whom God doth
keep more as one of His family, as though in His household, as though in His peculiar: “Thy
God am I.” What wilt thou more? Requirest thou a reward from God, so that God may give
thee something; so that what He hath given thee may be thine own? Behold God Himself,
who shall give, is thine own. What richer than He? Gifts thou wast desiring, thou hast the
Giver Himself. “God, thy God, I am.”
15. What He requireth of man, let us see; what tribute our God, our Emperor and our
King doth enjoin us; since He hath willed to be our King, and hath willed us to be His
province? Let us hear His injunctions. Let not a poor man tremble beneath the injunction
of God: what God enjoineth to be given to Himself, He doth Himself first give that enjoineth:
be ye only devoted. God doth not exact what He hath not given, and to all men hath given
what He doth exact. For what doth He exact? Let us hear now: “I will not reprove thee because
of thy sacrifices” (ver. 8). I will not say to thee, Wherefore hast thou not slain for me a fat
bull? why hast thou not selected the best he-goat from thy flock? Wherefore doth that ram
amble among thy sheep, and is not laid upon mine altar? I will not say, Examine thy fields

and thy pen1748 and thy walls, seeking what thou mayest give Me. “I will not reprove thee
because of thy sacrifices.” What then: Dost Thou not accept my sacrifices? “But thy holocausts
are always in My sight” (ver. 9). Certain holocausts concerning which it is said in another
Psalm, “If Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would surely have given, with holocausts Thou
wilt not be delighted:” 1749 and again he turneth himself, “Sacrifice to God is a troubled
spirit, a heart broken and humbled God doth not despise.”1750 Which be then holocausts
that He despiseth not? Which holocausts that are always in His sight? “Kindly, O Lord,” he
saith, “deal in Thy good will with Sion, and be the walls of Jerusalem builded, then shalt
Thou accept the sacrifice of righteousness, oblations, and holocausts.” He saith that certain
holocausts God will accept. But what is a holocaust? A whole consumed with fire: causis is
burning, holon is whole: but a “holocaust” is a whole consumed with fire. There is a certain
fire of most burning love: be the mind inflamed with love, let the same love hurry off the
limbs to its use, let it not allow them to serve cupidity, in order that we may wholly glow
with fire of divine love that will offer to God a holocaust. Such “holocausts of thine are in
My sight always.”
16. As yet that Israel perchance doth not understand what are the holocausts thereof
which He hath in His sight always, and is still thinking of oxen, of sheep, of he-goats: let it
not so think: “I will not accept calves of thy house.” Holocausts I named; at once in mind
and thought to earthly flocks thou wast running, therefrom thou wast selecting for Me some
fat thing: “I will not accept calves of thy house.” He is foretelling the New Testament, wherein
all those sacrifices have ceased. For they were then foretelling a certain Sacrifice which was
to be, with the Blood whereof we should be cleansed. “I will not accept calves of thy house,
nor he-goats of thy flocks.”
17. “For mine are all the beasts of the wood” (ver. 10). Why should I ask of thee what I
have made? Is it more thine, to whom I have given it to possess, than Mine, who have made
it? “For mine are all the beasts of the wood.” But perchance that Israel saith, The beasts are
God’s, those wild beasts which I enclose not in my pen, which I bind not to my stall; but
this ox and sheep and he-goat—these are mine own. “Cattle on the mountain, and oxen.”1751
Mine are those which thou possessest not, Mine are these which thou possessest. For if thou
art My servant, the whole of thy property is Mine. For it cannot be, that is the property of
the master which the servant hath gotten to himself, and yet that not be the property of the
Master which the Master Himself hath created for the servant. Therefore Mine are the beasts

of the wood which thou hast not taken; Mine are also the cattle on the mountains which are
thine, and the oxen which are at thy stall: all are Mine own, for I have created them.
18. “I know all the winged creatures of heaven” (ver. 11). How doth He know? He hath
weighed them, hath counted. Which of us knoweth all the winged creatures of heaven? But
even though to some man God give knowledge of all the winged creatures of heaven, He
doth not Himself know in the same manner as He giveth man to know. One thing is God’s
knowledge, another man’s: in like manner as there is one possession of God’s, another of
man’s: that is, God’s possessing is one thing, man’s another. For what thou possessest thou
hast not wholly in thy power, or else thy ox, so long as it liveth, is in thy power; so as that it
either die not, or be not to be fed. With whom there is the highest power, there is highest
and most secret cognition. Let us ascribe this to God, while praising God. Let us not dare
to say, How knoweth God? Do not, I pray you, brethren, of me expect this, that I should
unfold to you, how God doth know: this only I say, He doth not so know as a man, He doth
not so know as an Angel: and how He knoweth I dare not say, because also I cannot ken.
One thing, nevertheless, I ken, that even before all the winged creatures of heaven were,
God knew that which He was to create. What is that knowledge? O man, thou beginnest to
see, after that thou hadst been formed, after that thou hadst received sense of seeing. These
fowls sprung of the water at the word of God, saying, “Let the waters bring forth fowls.”1752
Whereby did God know the things which He commanded the water to bear forth? Now
surely He knew what He had created, and before He created He knew. So great then is the
knowledge of God, so that with Himself they were in a certain ineffable manner before they
were created: and of thee doth He expect to receive what He had, before He created? “I know
all the winged creatures of heaven,” which thou to Me canst not give. The things which thou
wast about to slay for Me, I know all: not because I made I know, but in order that I might
make. “And the beauty of the field is with Me.” The fairness of the field, the abundance of
all things engendering upon earth, “is with Me,” He saith. How with Him? Were they so,
even before they were made? Yea, for with Him were all things to come, and with Him are
all things by-gone: things to come in such sort, that there be not withdrawn from Him all
things by-gone. With Him are all things by a certain cognition of the ineffable wisdom of
God residing in the Word, and the1753 Word Himself is all things. Is not the beauty of the
field in a manner with Him, inasmuch as He is everywhere, and Himself hath said, “Heaven
and earth I fill”?1754 What with Him is not, of whom it is said, “If I shall have ascended into
heaven, Thou art there; and if I shall have descended into hell, Thou art present”?1755 With
1752 Gen. i. 20.
1753 Or, “In (or with) the Word Himself are all things.”
1754 Jer. xxiii. 24.
1755 Ps. cxxxix. 8.
Psalm L
Him is the whole: but it is not so with Him as that He doth suffer any contamination from
those things which He hath created, or any want of them. For with thee, perchance, is a
pillar near which thou art standing, and when thou art weary, thou leanest against it. Thou
needest that which is with thee, God needeth not the field which is which Him. With Him
is field, with Him beauty of earth, with Him beauty of heaven, with Him all winged creatures,
because He is Himself everywhere. And wherefore are all things near Him? Because even
before that all things were, or were created, to Him were known all things.
19. Who can explain, who expound that which is said to Him in another Psalm, “For
my goods Thou needest not”?1756 He hath said that He needeth not from us any necessary
thing. “If I shall be hungry, I will not tell thee” (ver. 12). He that keepeth Israel shall neither
hunger nor thirst, nor be weary, nor fall asleep.1757 But, lo! according to thy carnality I
speak: because thou wilt suffer hunger when thou hast not eaten, perhaps thou thinkest
even God doth hunger that He may eat. Even though He shall be hungry, He telleth not
thee: all things are before Him, whence He will He taketh what is needful for Him. These
words are said to convince little understanding; not that God hath declared His hunger.
Though for our sake this God of gods deigned even to hunger. He came to hunger, and to
fill; He came to thirst, and give drink; He came to be clothed with mortality, and to clothe
with immortality; He came poor, to make rich. For He lost not His riches by taking to Him
our poverty, for, “In him are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.”1758 “If I
shall be hungry, I will not tell thee. For Mine is the whole world, and the fulness thereof.”
Do not then labour to find what to give Me, without whom I have what I will.
20. Why then dost still think of thy flocks? “Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or shall I drink
the blood of he-goats?” (ver. 13). Ye have heard what of us He requireth not, who willeth
to enjoin us somewhat. If of such things ye were thinking, now withdraw your thoughts
from such things: think not to offer God any such thing. If thou hast a fat bull, kill for the
poor: let them eat the flesh of bulls, though they shall not drink the blood of he-goats. Which,
when thou shalt have done, He will account it to thee, that hath said, “If I shall be hungry,
I will not tell thee:” and He shall say to thee, “I was hungry, and thou gavest Me to eat.”
“Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or shall I drink the blood of he-goats?”1759
21. Say then, Lord our God, what dost Thou enjoin thy people, Thy Israel? “Immolate
to God the sacrifice of praise” (ver. 14). Let us also say to Him, “In me, O God, are thy vows,
which I will render of prose to Thee.” I had feared lest Thou mightest enjoin something
which would be out of my power, which I was counting to be in my pen, and but now per-

chance it had been taken away by a thief. What dost Thou enjoin me? “Immolate to God
the sacrifice of praise.” Let me revert to myself, wherein I may find what I may immolate:
let me revert to myself; in myself may I find immolation of praise: be Thy altar my conscience.
We are without anxiety, we go not into Arabia in quest of frankincense:1760 not any bags
of covetous dealer do we sift: God requireth of us the sacrifice of praise. Zacchæus had the
sacrifice of praise in his patrimony;1761 the widow had it in her bag;1762 some poor host or
other hath had it in his jar: another neither in patrimony, nor in bag, nor in jar, hath had
anything, had it wholly in his heart: salvation was to the house of Zacchæus; and more this
poor widow cast in than those rich men: this man, that doth offer a cup of cold water, shall
not lose his reward:1763 but there is even “peace on earth to men of good will.”1764 “Immolate
to God the sacrifice of praise.” O sacrifice gratuitous, by grace given! I have not indeed
bought this to offer, but Thou hast given: for not even this should I have had. And this is
the immolation of the sacrifice of praise, to render thanks to Him from whom thou hast
whatever of good thou hast, and by whose mercy is forgiven thee whatsoever of evil of thine
thou hast. “Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise: and render to the Highest thy prayers.”
With this odour the Lord is well pleased.1765
22. “And call thou upon Me in the day of thy tribulation: and I will draw thee forth, and
thou shalt glorify Me” (ver. 15). For thou oughtest not to rely on thy powers, all thy aids are
deceitful. “Upon Me call thou in the day of tribulation: I will draw thee forth, and thou shalt
glorify Me.” For to this end I have allowed the day of tribulation to come to thee: because
perchance if thou wast not troubled, thou wouldest not call on Me: but when thou art
troubled, thou callest on Me; when thou callest upon Me, I will draw thee forth; when I shall
draw thee forth, thou shalt glorify Me, that thou mayest no more depart from Me. A certain
man had grown dull and cold in fervour of prayer, and said, “Tribulation and grief I found,
and on the Name of the Lord I called.”1766 He found tribulation as it were some profitable
thing; he had rotted in the slough of his sins; now he had continued without feeling, he
found tribulation to be a sort of caustic and cutting. “I found,” he saith, “tribulation and
grief, and on the Name of the Lord I called.” And truly, brethren, tribulations are known to
all men. Behold those afflictions that abound in mankind; one afflicted with loss bewaileth;
another smitten with bereavement mourneth; another exiled from country grieveth and

desireth to return, deeming sojourning intolerable; another’s vineyard is hailed upon, he
observeth his labours and all his toil spent in vain. When can a human being not be made
sad? An enemy he findeth in a friend. What greater misery in mankind? These things all
men do deplore and grieve at, and these are tribulations: in all these they call upon the Lord,
and they do rightly. Let them call upon God, He is able either to teach how it must be borne,
or to heal it when borne. He knoweth how not to suffer us to be tried above that we are able
to bear.1767 Let us call upon God even in those tribulations: but these tribulations do find
us; as in another Psalm is written, “Helper in tribulations which have found us too much:”1768
there is a certain tribulation which we ought to find. Let such tribulations find us: there is
a certain tribulation which we ought to seek and to find. What is that? The above-named
felicity in this world, abundance of temporal things: that is not indeed tribulation, these are
the solaces of our tribulation. Of what tribulation? Of our sojourning. For the very fact that
we are not yet with God, the very fact that we are living amid trials and difficulties, that we
cannot be without fear, is tribulation: for there is not that peace which is promised us. He
that shall not have found this tribulation in his sojourning, doth not think of going home
to his father-land. This is tribulation, brethren. Surely now we do good works, when we deal
bread to the hungry, home to the stranger, and the like: tribulation even this is. For we find
pitiful objects upon whom we show pity; and the pitiful case of pitiful objects maketh us
compassionate. How much better now would it be with thee in that place, where thou
findest no hungry man whom thou mayest feed, where thou findest no stranger whom thou
mayest take in, no naked man whom thou mayest cover, no sick man whom thou mayest
visit, no litigant whom thou mayest set at one! For all things in that place are most high, are
true, are holy, are everlasting. Our bread in that place is righteousness, our drink there is
wisdom, our garment there is immortality, our house is everlasting in the heavens, our
stedfastness1769 is immortality: doth sickness come over? Doth weariness weigh down to
sleep? No death, no litigation: there peace, quiet, joy, righteousness. No enemy hath entrance,
no friend falleth away. What is the quiet there? If we think and observe where we are, and
where He that cannot lie hath promised that we are to be, from His very promise we find
in what tribulation we are. This tribulation none findeth, but he that shall have sought it.
Thou art whole, see if thou art miserable; for it is easy for him that is sick to find himself
miserable: when thou art whole, see if thou art miserable; that thou art not yet with God.
“Tribulation and grief I found, and on the Name of the Lord I called.”1770 “Immolate,”
therefore, “to God the sacrifice of praise.” Praise Him promising, praise Him calling, praise

Him exhorting, praise Him helping: and understand in what tribulation thou art placed.

23. But see what followeth, my brethren. For now some one or other, because God had
said to him, “Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise,” and had enjoined in a manner this
tribute, did meditate to himself and said, I will rise daily, I will proceed to Church, I will say
one hymn at matins, another at vespers, a third or fourth in my house, daily I do sacrifice
the sacrifice of praise, and immolate to my God. Well thou doest indeed, if thou doest this:
but take heed, lest now thou be careless, because now thou doest this: and perchance thy
tongue bless God, and thy life curse God. O my people, saith to thee the God of gods, the
Lord that spake, “calling the earth from the rising of the sun unto the setting,” though yet
thou art placed amid the tares,1771 “Immolate the sacrifice of praise to thy God, and render
to Him thy prayers:” but take heed lest thou live ill, and chant well. Wherefore this? For,
“Unto the sinner, saith God, why dost thou tell out My judgments, and takest My Covenant
in thy mouth?” (ver. 16). Ye see, brethren, with what trembling we say these words. We take
the Covenant of God in our mouth, and we say these words. We take the Covenant of God
in our mouth, and we preach to you the instruction and judgment of God. And what saith
God to the sinner? “Why dost thou?” Doth He then forbid preachers that be sinners? And
where is that, “What they say do, but what they do, do not”?1772 Where is that, “Whether
in truth or on occasion Christ be preached”?1773 But these words were said, lest they should
fear that hear, from whomsoever it be that they hear: not that they should be without care
that speak good words, and do evil deeds. Now therefore, brethren, ye are without care: if
ye hear good words ye hear God,1774 through whomsoever it be that ye may hear. But God
would not dismiss without reproof them that speak: lest with their speaking alone, without
care for themselves they should slumber in evil life, and say to themselves, “For God will
not consign us to perdition, through whose mouth He has willed that so many good words
should be spoken to His people.” Nay, but hear what thou speakest, whoever thou art that
speakest: and thou that writ be heard thyself, first hear thyself; and speak what a certain
man doth speak in another Psalm,1775 “I will hear what in me speaketh the Lord God, for
He shall speak peace to His people.” What am I then, that hear not what in me He speaketh,
and will that other hear what through me He speaketh? I will hear first, will hear, and chiefly
I will hear what speaketh in me the Lord God, for He shall speak peace to His people. Let
me hear, and “chasten my body, and to servitude subject it, lest perchance to others

preaching, myself be found a cast-away.” 1776 “Why dost thou tell out my judgments?”
Wherefore to thee what profiteth not thee? He admonisheth him to hear: not to lay down
preaching, but to take up obedience. “But thou, why dost thou take My Covenant in they
mouth?”
24. “But thou hatest instruction” (ver. 17). Thou hatest discipline. When I spare, thou
singest and praisest: when I chasten, thou murmurest: as though, when I spare, I am thy
God: and, when I chasten, I am not thy God. “I rebuke and chasten those whom I love.”1777
“But thou hatest instruction: and hast thrown My sayings behind thee.” The words that are
said through thee, thou throwest behind thee. “And thou hast thrown My sayings behind
thee:” to a place where they may not be seen by thee, but may load thee. “And thou hast
thrown My sayings behind thee.”
25. “If thou sawest a thief, thou didst consent unto him, and with adulterers thou didst
make thy portion” (ver. 18). Lest perchance thou shouldest say, I have not committed theft,
I have not committed adultery. What if he pleased thee that hath committed? Hast thou not
with the very pleasing consented? Hast thou not by approval made thy portion with him
that hath committed? For this is, brethren, to consent with a thief, and to make with an
adulterer thy portion: for even if thou committest not, and approvest what is committed,
thou art an accessory in the deed: for “the sinner is praised in the longings of his soul, and
he that doeth iniquity shall be blessed.”1778 Thou doest not evil things, thou praisest evil-
doers. For is this a small evil? “Thou didst make thy portion with adulterers.”
26. “Thy mouth hath abounded in malice, and thy tongue hath embraced deceit” (ver.
19). Of the malevolence and deceit, brethren, of certain men he speaketh, who by adulation,
though they know what they hear to be evil, yet lest they offend those from whom they hear,
not only by not reproving but by holding their peace do consent.1779 Too little is it, that
they do not say, Thou hast done evil: but they even say, Thou hast done even well: and they
know it to be evil: but their mouth aboundeth in malice, and their tongue embraceth deceit.
Deceit is a sort of guile in words, of uttering one thing, thinking another. He saith not, thy
tongue hath committed deceit or perpetrated deceit, but in order to point out to thee a kind
of pleasure taken in the very evil doing, He hath said, “Hath embraced.” It is too little that
thou doest it, thou art delighted too; thou praisest openly, thou laughest to thyself. Thou
dost push to destruction a man heedlessly putting forth his faults, and knowing not whether
they be faults: thou that knowest it to be a fault, sayest not, “Whither art thou rushing?” If

thou wert to see him heedlessly walk in the dark, where thou knewest a well to be, and wert
to hold thy peace, of what sort wouldest thou be? wouldest thou not be set down for an enemy
of his life? 1780 And yet if he were to fall into a well, not in soul1781 but in body he would
die. He doth fall headlong into his vices, he doth expose before thee his evil doings: thou
knowest them to be evil, and praisest and laughest to thyself. Oh that at length he were to
be turned to God at whom thou laughest, and whom thou wouldest not reprove, and that
he were to say, “Let them be confounded that say to me, Well, well.”1782
27. “Sitting against thy brother thou didst detract” (ver. 20). And this “sitting” doth
belong to that whereof he hath spoken above in, “hath embraced.” For he that doeth anything
while standing or passing along, doth it not with pleasure: but if he for this purpose sitteth,
how much leisure doth he seek out to do it! That very evil detraction thou wast making with
diligence, thou wast making sitting; thou wouldest thereon be wholly engaged; thou wast
embracing thy evil, thou wast kissing thy craftiness. “And against thy mother’s son thou
didst lay a stumbling-block.” Who is “mother’s son”? Is it not brother? He would repeat
then the same that he had said above, “thy brother.” Hath he intimated that any distinction
must be perceived by us? Evidently, brethren, I think a distinction must be made. Brother
against brother doth detract, for example’s sake, as though for instance one strong, and now
a doctor and scholar of some weight, doth detract from his brother, one perchance that is
teaching well and walking well: but another is weak, against him he layeth a stumbling-block
by detracting from the former. For when the good are detracted from by those that seem to
be of some weight and to be learned, the weak fall upon the stumbling-block, who as yet
know not how to judge. Therefore this weak one is called “mother’s son,” not yet father’s,
still needing milk, and hanging on the breast. He is borne as yet in the bosom of his mother
the Church, he is not strong enough to draw near to the solid food of his Father’s table, but
from the mother’s breast he draweth sustenance, unskilled in judging, inasmuch as yet he
is animal and carnal. “For the spiritual man judgeth all things,”1783 but “the animal man
perceiveth not those things which are of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him.”1784
To such men saith the Apostle, “I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal, as to babes in Christ I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for ye were not able, but not
even now are ye able.”1785 A mother I have been to you: as is said in another place, “I became
a babe among you, even as a nurse cherishing her own children.”1786 Not a nurse nursing

children of others, but a nurse cherishing her own children. For there are mothers who
when they have borne give to nurses: they that have borne cherish not their children, because
they have given them to be nursed;1787 but those that cherish, cherish not their own, but
those of others: but he himself had borne, he was himself cherishing, to no nurse did commit
what he had borne; for he had said, “Of whom I travail again until Christ be formed in
you.”1788 He did cherish them, and gave milk. But there were some as it were learned and
spiritual men who detracted from Paul. “His letters indeed, say they, are weighty and
powerful; but the presence of his body weak, and speech contemptible:”1789 he saith himself
in his Epistle, that certain his detractors had said these words. They were sitting, and were
detracting against their brother, and against that their mother’s son, to be fed with milk,
they were laying a stumbling-block. “And against thy mother’s son thou didst lay a stumbling-
block.”
28. “These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue” (ver. 21). Therefore the Lord
our God shall come, and shall not keep silence. Now, “These things hast thou done, and I
held my tongue.” What is, “I held my tongue”? From vengeance I have desisted, my severity
I have deferred, patience to thee I have prolonged, thy repentance I have long looked
for…“Thou hast imagined iniquity, that I shall be like unto thee;” Thou hast1790 imagined
that I shall be like unto thee, while thou wilt not be like unto Me. For, “Be ye,” he saith,
“perfect, even as your Father, which is in the heavens, who maketh His sun to rise on the
good and evil.”1791 Him thou wouldest not copy, who giveth good things even to evil men,
insomuch that sitting thou dost detract even from good men. “I will reprove thee,” when
“God manifest shall come, our God, and shall not keep silence,” “I will reprove thee.” And
what to thee shall I do in reproving thee? what to thee shall I do? Now thyself thou seest
not, I will make thee see thyself. Because if thou shouldest see thyself, and shouldest displease
thyself, thou wouldest please Me: but because not seeing thyself thou hast pleased thyself,
thou wilt displease both Me and thyself; Me when thou shalt be judged; thyself when thou
shalt burn. But what to thee shall I do? He saith. “I will set thee before thy face.” For why
wouldest thou escape thyself? At thy back thou art to thyself, thou seest not thyself: I make
thee see thyself: what behind thy back thou hast put, before thy face will I put; thou shalt
see thy uncleanness, not that thou mayest amend, but that thou mayest blush.…

keepeth not silence, spareth1792 not. Thou hadst forgotten the Lord,1793 didst not think of
thy evil life. Perceive how thou hast forgotten the Lord. “Lest at length He seize like a lion,
and there be none to deliver.” What is “like a lion”? Like a brave one, like a mighty one, like
him whom none can withstand. To this he made reference when he said, “Lion.” For it is
used for praise, it is used also for showing evil. The devil hath been called lion: “Your ad-
versary,” He saith, “like a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom He may devour.”1794
May it not be that whereas he hath been called lion because of savage fierceness, Christ hath
been called Lion for wondrous mightiness? And where is that, “The Lion hath prevailed of
the tribe of Judah?”1795…
30. “Sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me” (ver. 23). How shall “sacrifice of praise glorify
Me”? Assuredly sacrifice of praise doth no wise profit evil men, because they take Thy
Covenant in their mouth, and do damnable things that displease Thine eyes. Straightway,
he saith, even to them this I say, “Sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me.” For if thou livest ill
and speakest good words, not yet dost thou praise: but again, if, when thou beginnest to live
well, to thy merits thou dost ascribe thy living well, not yet dost thou praise.…Therefore
the Publican went down justified, rather than that Pharisee. Therefore hear ye that live well,
hear ye that live ill: “Sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me.” No one offereth Me this sacrifice,
and is evil. I say not, Let there not offer Me this any one that is evil; but no one doth offer
Me this, that is evil. For he that praiseth, is good: because if he praiseth, he doth also live
well, because if he praiseth, not only with tongue he praiseth, but life also with tongue doth
agree.
31. “And there is the way whereby I will show him the salvation of God.” In sacrifice of
praise “is the way.” What is “the salvation of God”? Christ Jesus. And how in sacrifice of
praise to us is shown Christ? Because Christ with grace came to us. These words saith the
Apostle: “But I live, now not I, but Christ liveth in me: but that in flesh I live, in faith I live
of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.” 1796 Acknowledge then sinners,
that there would not need physician, if they were whole.1797 For Christ died for the un-
godly.1798 When then they acknowledge their ungodlinesses, and first copy that Publican,
saying, “Lord, be merciful to me a sinner:”1799 show wounds, beseech Physician: and because

for this end He came, that He might save sinners: for “Jesus Christ came,” he saith, “into
this world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.”1801 Further, those Jews, boasting of their
work, thus the same Apostle doth rebuke, in saying, that they to grace belonged not, who
to their merits and their works thought that reward was owing.1802 He therefore that knoweth
himself to belong to grace, doth know what is Christ and what is Christ’s because he needeth
grace. If grace it is called, gratis it is given; if gratis it is given, not any merits of time have
preceded that it should be given.…

Psalm LI.1803
1. Neither must this multitude’s throng be defrauded, nor their infirmity burthened.
Silence we ask, and quiet, in order that our voice, after yesterday’s labour, be able with some
little vigour to last out. It must be believed, that your love hath met together in greater
numbers to-day for nothing else, but that ye may pray for those whom an alien and perverse
inclination doth keep away. For we are speaking neither of heathens nor of Jews, but of
Christians: nor of those that are yet Catechumens, but of many that are even baptized, from
the Laver of whom ye do no wise differ, and yet to their heart ye are unlike. For to-day how
many brethren of ours we think of, and deplore their going unto vanities and lying insanities,
to the neglect of that to which they have been called. Who, if in the very circus from any
cause they chance to be startled, do immediately cross themselves,1804 and stand bearing It
on the forehead, in the very place, from whence they had withdrawn, if they had borne It
in heart. God’s mercy must be implored, that He may give understanding for condemning
these things, inclination to flee them, and mercy to forgive. Opportunately, then, of Penitence
a Psalm to-day has been chanted. Speak we even with the absent: there will be to them for
our voice your memory. Neglect not the wounded and feeble, but that ye may more easily
make whole, whole ye ought to abide. Correct by reproving, comfort by addressing, set an
example by living well, He will be with them that hath been with you. For now that ye have
overpassed these dangers, the fountain of God’s mercy is not closed. Where ye have come
they will come; where ye have passed they will pass. A grievous thing it is indeed, and ex-
ceeding perilous, nay ruinous, and for certain a deadly thing, that witting they sin. For in
one way to these vanities doth he run that despiseth the voice of Christ; in another way, he
that knoweth from what he is fleeing. But that not even of such men we ought to despair,
this Psalm doth show.
2. For there is written over it the title thereof, “A Psalm of David himself, when there
came to him Nathan the prophet, when he went in unto Bersabee.” Bersabee was a woman,
wife of another. With grief indeed we speak, and with trembling; but yet God would not
have to be hushed what He hath willed to be written. I will say then not what I will, but what
I am obliged; I will say not as one exhorting to imitation, but as one instructing you to fear.
Captivated with this woman’s beauty, the wife of another, the king and prophet David, from
whose seed according to the flesh the Lord was to come,1805 committed adultery with her.
This thing in this Psalm is not read, but in the title thereof it appeareth; but in the book of
Kings1806 it is more fully read. Both Scriptures are canonical, to both without any doubt by
1803 From a sermon to the people of Carthage. See below, § 11.

Christians credit must be given. The sin was committed, and was written down. Moreover
her husband in war he caused to be killed: and after this deed there was sent to him Nathan
the prophet;1807 sent by the Lord, to reprove him for so great an outrage.
3. What men should beware of, we have said; but what if they shall have fallen they
should imitate, let us hear. For many men will to fall with David, and will not to rise with
David. Not then for falling is the example set forth, but if thou shalt have fallen for rising
again. Take heed lest thou fall. Not the delight of the younger be the lapse of the elder, but
be the fall of the elder the dread of the younger. For this it was set forth, for this was written,
for this in the Church often read and chanted: let them hear that have not fallen, lest they
fall; let them hear that have fallen, that they may rise. So great a man’s sin is not hushed, is
proclaimed in the Church. There men hear that are ill hearers, and seek for themselves
countenance for sinning: they look out for means whereby they may defend what they have
made ready to commit, not how they may beware of what they have not committed, and
they say to themselves, If David, why not I too? Thence that soul is more unrighteous, which,
forasmuch as it hath done it because David did, therefore hath done worse than David. I
will say this very thing, if I shall be able, more plainly. David had set forth to himself none
for a precedent as thou hast: he had fallen by lapse of concupiscence, not by the countenance
of holiness: thou dost set before thine eyes as it were a holy man, in order that thou mayest
sin: thou dost not copy his holiness, but dost copy his fall. Thou1808 dost love that in David,
which in himself David hated: thou makest thee ready to sin, thou inclinest to sin: in order
that thou mayest sin thou consultest the book of God: the Scriptures of God for this thou
hearest, that thou mayest do what displeaseth God. This did not David; he was reproved by
a Prophet, he stumbled not over a Prophet. But others hearing to their health, by the fall of
a strong man measure their weakness: and desiring to avoid what God condemneth, from
careless looking do restrain their eyes. Them they fix not upon the beauty of another’s flesh,
nor make themselves careless with perverse simpleness; they say not, “With good intent I
have observed, of kindness I have observed, of charity I have long looked.” For they set before
themselves the fall of David, and they see that this great man for this purpose hath fallen,
in order that little men may not be willing to look on that whereby they may fall. For they
restrain their eyes from wantonness, not readily do they join themselves in company, they
do not mingle with strange women, they raise not complying eyes to strange balconies, to
strange terraces. For from afar David saw her with whom he was captivated.1809 Woman
afar, lust near. What he saw was elsewhere, in himself that whereby he fell. This weakness
of the flesh must be therefore minded, the words of the Apostle recollected, “Let not sin

Psalm LI
therefore reign in your mortal body.”1810 He hath not said, let there not be; but, “let there
not reign.” There is sin in thee, when thou takest pleasure; there reigneth, if thou shalt have
consented. Carnal pleasure, especially if proceeding unto unlawful and strange objects, is
to be bridled, not let loose: by government to be tamed, not to be set up for government.
Look and be without care, if thou hast nothing whereby thou mayest be moved. But thou
makest answer, “I contain with strong resolution.” Art thou any wise stronger than David?1811
4. He admonisheth, moreover, by such an example, that no one ought to lift himself up
in prosperous circumstances. For many fear adverse circumstances, fear not prosperous
circumstances. Prosperity is more perilous to soul than adversity to body. First, prosperity
doth corrupt, in order that adversity may find something to break. My brethren, stricter
watch must be kept against felicity. Wherefore, see ye after what manner the saying of God
amid our own felicity doth take from us security: “Serve ye,” He saith, “the Lord in fear, and
exult unto Him with trembling.”1812 In exultation, in order that we may render thanks; in
trembling, lest we fall. This sin did not David, when he was suffering Saul for persecutor.1813
When holy David was suffering Saul his enemy, when he was being vexed by his persecutions,
when he was fleeing through divers places, in order that he might not fall into his hands, he
lusted not for her that was another’s, he slew not husband after committing adultery with
wife. He was in the infirmity of his tribulation so much the more intimate with God as he
seemed more miserable. Something useful is tribulation; useful the surgeon’s lancet rather
than the devil’s temptation. He became secure when his enemies were overthrown, pressure
was removed, swelling grew out. This example therefore doth avail to this end, that we
should fear felicity. “Tribulation,” he saith, “and grief I found, and on the name of the Lord
I called.”1814
5. But it was done; I would say these words to those that have not done the like, in order
that they should watch to keep their uncorruptness, and that while they take heed how a
great one has fallen, they that be small should fear. But if any that hath already fallen heareth
these words, and that hath in his conscience any evil thing; to the words of this Psalm let
him advert; let him heed the greatness of the wound, but not despair of the majesty of the
Physician. Sin with despair is certain death. Let no one therefore say, If already any evil
thing I have done, already I am to be condemned: God pardoneth not such evil things, why
add I not sins to sins? I will enjoy this word in pleasure, in wantonness, in wicked cupidity:
now hope of amendment having been lost, let me have even what I see, if I cannot have what

I believe. This Psalm then, while it maketh heedful those that have not believed, so doth not
will them that have fallen to be despaired of. Whoever thou art that hast sinned, and hesitatest
to exercise penitence1815 for thy sin, despairing of thy salvation, hear David groaning. To
thee Nathan the prophet hath not been sent, David himself hath been sent to thee. Hear
him crying, and with him cry: hear him groaning, and with him groan; hear him weeping,
and mingle tears; hear him amended, and with him rejoice. If from thee sin could not be
excluded, be not hope of pardon excluded. There was sent to that man Nathan the prophet,
observe the king’s humility. 1816 He rejected not the words of him giving admonition, he
said not, Darest thou speak to me, a king? An exalted king heard a prophet, let His humble
people hear Christ.
6. Hear therefore these words, and say thou with him: “Have pity upon me, O God, after
Thy great mercy” (ver. 1). He that imploreth great mercy, confesseth great misery. Let them
seek a little mercy of Thee, that have sinned in ignorance: “Have pity,” he saith, “upon me,
after Thy great mercy.” Relieve a deep wound after Thy great healing. Deep is what I have,
but in the Almighty I take refuge. Of my own so deadly wound I should despair, unless I
could find so great a Physician. “Have pity upon me, O God, after Thy great mercy: and
after the multitude of Thy pities, blot out my iniquity.” What he saith, “Blot out my iniquity,”
is this, “Have pity upon me, O God.” And what he saith, “After the multitude of Thy pities,”
is this, “After Thy great mercy.” Because great is the mercy, many are the mercies; and of
Thy great mercy, many are Thy pitying. Thou dost regard mockers to amend them, dost
regard ignorant men to teach them, dost regard men confessing to pardon. Did he this in
ignorance? A certain man had done some, aye many evil things he had done; “Mercy,” he
saith, “I obtained, because ignorant I did it in unbelief.”1817 This David could not say, “Ig-
norant I did it.” For he was not ignorant how very evil a thing was the touching of another’s
wife, and how very evil a thing was the killing of the husband, who knew not of it, and was
not even angered. They obtain therefore the mercy of the Lord that have in ignorance done
it; and they that have knowing done it, obtain not any mercy it may chance, but “great
mercy.”
7. “More and more wash me from mine unrighteousness” (ver. 2). What is, “More and
more wash”? One much stained. More and more wash the sins of one knowing. Thou that
hast washed off the sins of one ignorant. Not even thus is it to be despaired of Thy mercy.
“And from my delinquency purge Thou me.” According to the manner in which He is
physician, offer a recompense. He is God, offer sacrifice. What wilt thou give that thou

Psalm LI
mayest be purged? For see upon whom thou callest; upon a Just One thou callest. He hateth
sins, if He is just; He taketh vengeance upon sins, if He is just; thou wilt not be able to take
away from the Lord God His justice: entreat mercy, but observe the justice: there is mercy
to pardon the sinner, there is justice to punish the sin. What then? Thou askest mercy; shall
sin unpunished abide? Let David answer, let those that have fallen answer, answer with
David, and say, No, Lord, no sin of mine shall be unpunished; I know the justice of Him
whose mercy I ask: it shall not be unpunished, but for this reason I will not that Thou punish
me, because I punish my sin: for this reason I beg that Thou pardon, because I acknowledge.
8. “For mine iniquity I acknowledge, and my delinquency is before me ever” (ver. 3). I
have not put behind my back what I have done, I look not at others, forgetful of myself, I
pretend not to pull out a straw from my brother’s eye, when there is a beam in my eye;1818
my sin is before me, not behind me. For it was behind me when to me was sent the Prophet,
and set before me the parable of the poor man’s sheep.1819 For saith Nathan the Prophet to
David, “There was a certain rich man having very many sheep; but a poor man his neighbour
had one little ewe sheep, which in his bosom and of his own food he was feeding: there came
a stranger to the rich man, nothing from his flock he took, for the lithe ewe sheep of the
poor man his neighbour he lusted; her he slew for the stranger: what doth he deserve?” But
the other being angry doth pronounce sentence: then the king, evidently knowing not
wherein he had been taken,1820 declared the rich man deserving of death, and that the sheep
be restored fourfold. Most sternly and most justly. But his sin was not yet before him, behind
his back was what he had done: his own iniquity he did not yet acknowledge, and therefore
another’s he did not pardon. But the Prophet, being for this purpose sent, took from his
back the sin, and before his eyes placed it, so that he might see that sentence so stern to have
been pronounced against himself. For cutting and healing his heart’s wound, he made a
lancet of his tongue.…
9. “Against Thee alone have I sinned, and before Thee an evil thing have I done” (ver.
4). What is this? For before men was not another’s wife debauched and husband slain? Did
not all men know what David had done?1821 What is, “Against Thee alone have I sinned,
and before Thee an evil thing have I done.” Because Thou alone art without sin. He is a just
punisher that hath nothing in Him to be punished; He is a just reprover that hath nothing
in Him to be reproved. “That thou mayest be justified in Thy sayings, and conquer when
Thou art judged.” To whom he speaketh, brethren, to whom he speaketh, is difficult to un-
derstand. To God surely he speaketh, and it is evident that God the Father is not judged.

Psalm LI
What is, “And conquer when Thou art judged”? He seeth the future Judge to be judged, one
just by sinners to be judged, and therein conquering, because in Him was nothing to be
judged. For alone among men could truly say the God-Man, “If ye have found in Me sin,
say.”1822 But perchance there was what escaped men, and they found not what was really
there, but was not manifest. In another place1823 He saith, “Behold there cometh the Prince
of the world,” being an acute observer of all sins; “Behold,” He saith, “there cometh the
Prince of this world,” with death afflicting sinners, presiding over death: for, “By the malice
of the devil death came into the world.”1824 “Behold,” He saith, “there cometh the Prince
of the world:”—He said these words close upon His Passion:—“and in Me he shall find
nothing,” nothing of sin, nothing worthy of death, nothing worthy of condemnation. And
as if it were said to Him, Why then dost Thou die? He continueth and saith, “But that all
men may know that I do the will of My Father; arise, let us go hence.” I suffer, He saith,
undeserving, for men deserving, in order that them I may make deserving of My Life, for
whom I undeservedly suffer their death. To Him then, having no sin, saith on the present
occasion the Prophet David, “Against Thee only have I sinned, and before Thee an evil thing
have I done, that Thou mayest be justified in Thy sayings, and conquer when Thou art
judged.” For Thou overcomest all men, all judges; and he that deemeth himself just, before
Thee is unjust: Thou alone justly judgest, having been unjustly judged, That hast power to
lay down Thy life, and hast power again to take it.1825 Thou conquerest, then, when Thou
art judged. All men Thou overcomest, because Thou art more than men, and by Thee were
men made.
10. “For, behold, in iniquities I was conceived” (ver. 5). As though he were saying, They
are conquered that have done what thou, David, hast done: for this is not a little evil and
little sin, to wit, adultery and man-slaying. What of them that from the day that they were
born of their mother’s womb, have done no such thing? even to them dost thou ascribe
some sins, in order that He may conquer all men when He beginneth to be judged. David
hath taken upon him the person of mankind, and hath heeded the bonds of all men, hath
considered the offspring of death, hath adverted to the origin of iniquity, and he saith, “For,
behold, in iniquities I was conceived.” Was David born of adultery; being born of Jesse,1826
a righteous man, and his own wife? What is it that he saith himself to have been in iniquity
conceived, except that iniquity is drawn from Adam? Even the very bond of death, with
iniquity itself is engrained? No man is born without bringing punishment, bringing desert

of punishment. A Prophet saith also in another place,1827 “No one is clean in Thy sight, not
even an infant, whose life is of one day upon earth.” For we know both by the Baptism of
Christ that sins are loosed, and that the Baptism of Christ availeth the remission of sins. If
infants are every way innocent, why do mothers run with them when sick to the Church?1828
What by that Baptism, what by that remission is put away? An innocent one I see that rather
weeps than is angry. What doth Baptism wash off? what doth that Grace loose? There is
loosed the offspring of sin. For if that infant could speak to thee, it would say, and if it had
the understanding which David had, it would answer thee, Why heedest thou me, an infant?
Thou dost not indeed see my actions: but I in iniquity have been conceived, “And in sins
hath my mother nourished me in the womb.”
Apart from this bond of mortal1829 concupiscence was Christ born without a male, of
a virgin conceiving by the Holy Ghost. He cannot be said to have been conceived in iniquity,
it cannot be said, In sins His mother nourished Him in the womb, to whom was said, “The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Virtue of the Highest shall overshadow thee.”1830
It is not therefore because it is sin to have to do with wives that men are conceived in iniquity,
and in sins nourished in the womb by their mother; but because that which is made is surely
made of flesh deserving punishment.1831 For the punishment of the flesh is death, and surely
there is in it liability to death itself. Whence the Apostle spoke not of the body as if to die,
but as if dead: “The body indeed is dead,” he saith, “because of sin, but the Spirit is life because
of righteousness.”1832 How then without bond of sin is born that which is conceived and
sown of a body dead because of sin? This chaste operation in a married person hath not sin,
but the origin of sin draweth with it condign punishment. For there is no husband that,
because he is an husband, is not subject to death, or that is subject to death for any other
reason but because of sin. For even the Lord was subject to death, but not on account of sin:
He took upon Him our punishment, and so looseth our guilt. With reason then, “In Adam
all die, but in Christ shall all be made alive.”1833 For, “Through one man,” saith the Apostle,
“sin hath entered into this world, and through sin death, and so hath passed unto all men,

in that all have sinned.”1834 Definite is the sentence: “In Adam,” he saith, “all have sinned.”
Alone then could such an infant be innocent, as hath not been born of the work of Adam.
11. “For, behold, truth Thou hast loved: uncertain and hidden things of Thy wisdom,
Thou hast manifested to me” (ver. 6). That is, Thou hast not left unpunished even the sins
of those whom Thou dost pardon. “Truth Thou hast loved:” so mercy Thou hast granted
first,1835 as that Thou shouldest also preserve truth. Thou pardonest one confessing,
pardonest, but only if he punisheth himself: so there are preserved mercy and truth: mercy
because man is set free; truth, because sin is punished. “Uncertain and hidden things of Thy
wisdom Thou hast manifested to me.” What “hidden things”? What “uncertain things”?
Because God pardoneth even such. Nothing is so hidden, nothing so uncertain.1836 For this
uncertainty the Ninevites repented, for they said, though after the threatenings of the
Prophet, though after that cry, “Three days and Nineve shall be overthrown:”1837 they said
to themselves, Mercy must be implored; they said in this sort reasoning among themselves,
“Who knoweth whether God may turn for the better His sentence, and have pity?”1838 It
was “uncertain,” when it is said, “Who knoweth?” on an uncertainty they did repent,1839
certain mercy they earned: they prostrated them in tears, in fastings, in sackcloth and ashes
they prostrated them, groaned, wept, God spared. Nineve stood: was Nineve overthrown?
One way indeed it seemeth to men, and another way it seemed to God. But I think that it
was fulfilled that the Prophet had foretold. Regard what Nineve was, and see how it was
overthrown; overthrown in evil, builded in good; just as Saul the persecutor was overthrown,
Paul the preacher builded. 1840 Who would not say that this city, in which we now are, was
happily overthrown, if all those madmen, leaving their triflings,1841 were to run together
to the Church with contrite heart, and were to call upon God’s mercy for their past doings?
Should we not say, Where is that Carthage? Because there is not what there was, it is over-
thrown: but if there is what there was not, it is builded. So is said to Jeremiah, “Behold, I
will give to thee to root up, to dig under, to overthrow, to destroy,” and again, “to build, and
to plant.”1842 Thence is that voice of the Lord, “I will smite and I will heal.”1843 He smiteth

the rottenness of the deed, He healeth the pain of the wound. Physicians do thus when they
cut; they smite and heal; they arm themselves in order to strike, they carry steel, and come
to cure. But because great were the sins of the Ninevites, they said, “Who knoweth?” This
uncertainty had God disclosed to His servant David. For when he had said, before the
Prophet standing and convicting him, “I have sinned:” straightway he heard from the
Prophet, that is, from the Spirit of God which was in the Prophet, “Thy sin is put away from
thee.”1844 “Uncertain and hidden things” of His wisdom He manifested to him.1845
12. “Thou shalt sprinkle me,” he saith, “with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed” (ver. 7).
Hyssop we know to be a herb humble but healing: to the rock it is said to adhere with roots.
Thence in a mystery the similitude of cleansing the heart has been taken. Do thou also take
hold, with1846 the root of thy love, on thy Rock: be humble in thy humble God, in order
that thou mayest be exalted in thy glorified God. Thou shalt be sprinkled with hyssop, the
humility of Christ shall cleanse thee. Despise not the herb, attend to the efficacy of the
medicine. Something further I will say, which we are wont to hear from physicians, or to
experience in sick persons. Hyssop, they say, is proper for purging the lungs. In the lung is
wont to be noted pride: for there is inflation, there breathing. It was said of Saul the persecutor
as of Saul the proud, that he was going to bind Christians, breathing slaughter:1847 he was
breathing out slaughter, breathing out blood, his lung not yet cleansed. Hear also in this
place one humbled, because with hyssop purged: “Thou shalt wash me,” that is, shalt cleanse
me: “and above snow I shall be whitened.” “Although,” he saith, “your sins shall have been
like scarlet, like snow I will whiten.”1848 Out of such men Christ doth present to Himself a
vesture without spot and wrinkle.1849 Further, His vesture on the mount, which shone forth
like whitened snow,1850 signified the Church cleansed from every spot of sin.
13. But where is humility from hyssop? Hear what followeth: “To my hearing Thou
shall give exultation and gladness, and bones humbled shall exult” (ver. 8). I will rejoice in
hearing Thee, not in speaking against Thee. Thou hast sinned, why defendest thou thyself?
Thou wilt speak: suffer thou; hear, yield to divine words, lest thou be put to confusion, and
be still more wounded: sin hath been committed, be it not defended: to confession let it
come, not to defence. Thou engagest thyself as defender of thy sin, thou art conquered: no

innocent patron hast thou engaged, thy defence is not profitable to thee. For who art thou
that defendest thyself? Thou art meet to accuse thyself. Say not, either, “I have done nothing;”
or, “What great thing have I done?” or, “Other men as well have done.” If in doing sin thou
sayest thou hast done nothing, thou wilt be nothing, thou wilt receive nothing: God is ready
to give indulgence, thou closest the door against thyself: He is ready to give, do not oppose
the bar of defence, but open the bosom of confession. “To my hearing Thou shalt give ex-
ultation and gladness.”…
14. “Turn Thou away Thy face from my sins, and all mine iniquities blot out” (ver. 9).
For now bones humbled exult, now with hyssop cleansed, humble I have become. “Turn
Thou away Thy face,” not from me, but “from my sins.” For in another place praying he
saith, “Turn not away Thy face from me.”1851 He that would not that God’s face be turned
away from himself, would that God’s face be turned away from his sins. For to sin, when
God turneth not Himself away, he adverteth: if he adverteth, he animadverteth. “And all
mine iniquities blot out.” He is busied1852 with that capital sin: he reckoneth on more, he
would have all his iniquities to be blotted out: he relieth on the Physician’s hand, on that
“great mercy,” upon which he hath called in the beginning of the Psalm: “All mine iniquities
blot out.” God turneth away His face, and so blotteth out; by “turning away” His face, sins
He blotteth out. By “turning towards,” He writeth them. Thou hast heard of Him blotting
out by turning away, hear of Him by turning towards, doing what? “But the countenance
of the Lord is upon men doing evil things, that He may destroy from the earth the remem-
brance of them:”1853 He shall destroy the remembrance of them,1854 not by “blotting out
their sins.” But here he doth ask what? “Turn away Thy face from my sins.” Well he asketh.
For he himself doth not turn away his face from his own sins, saying, “For my sin I acknow-
ledge.” With reason thou askest and well askest, that God turn away from thy sin, if thou
from thence dost not turn away thy face: but if thou settest thy sin at thy back, God doth
there set His face. Do thou turn sin before thy face, if thou wilt that God thence turn away
His face; and then safely thou askest, and He heareth.
15. “A clean heart create in me, O God” (ver. 10). “Create”—he meant1855 to say, “as it
were begin something new.” But, because repentant he was praying (that had committed
some sin, which before he had committed, he was more innocent), after what manner he
hath said “create” he showeth. “And a right spirit renew in my inner parts.” By my doing,
he saith, the uprightness of my spirit hath been made old and bowed. For he saith in another

Psalm LI
Psalm, “They have bowed my soul.”1856 And when a man doth make himself stoop unto
earthly lusts, he is “bowed” in a manner, but when he is made erect for things above, upright
is his heart made, in order that God may be good to him. For, “How good is the God of Israel
to the upright of heart!”1857 Moreover, brethren, listen. Sometimes God in this world
chastiseth for his sin him that He pardoneth in the world to come. For even to David himself,
to whom it had been already said by the Prophet, “Thy sin is put away,”1858 there happened
certain things which God had threatened for that very sin.1859 For his son Abessalom against
him waged bloody war, and many ways humbled his father.1860 He was walking in grief, in
the tribulation of his humiliation, so resigned to God, that, ascribing to Him all that was
just, he confessed that he was suffering nothing undeservedly, having now an heart upright,
to which God was not displeasing. A slanderous person and one throwing in his teeth harsh
curses1861 he patiently heard, one of the soldiers on the opposite side, that were with his
unnatural son. And when he was heaping curses upon the king, one of the companions of
David, enraged, would have gone and smitten him; but he is kept back by David. And he is
kept back how? For that he said, God sent him to curse me. Acknowledging his guilt he
embraced his penance, seeking glory not his own, praising the Lord in that good which he
had, praising the Lord in that which he was suffering, “blessing the Lord alway, ever His
praise was in his mouth.”1862 Such are all the upright in heart: not those crooked persons
who think themselves upright and God crooked: who when they do any evil thing, rejoice;
when they suffer any evil thing, blaspheme; nay, if set in tribulation and scourging, they say
from their distorted heart, “O God, what have I done to Thee?” Truly it is because they have
done nothing to God, for they have done all to themselves. “And an upright spirit, renew
in my inner parts.”
16. “Cast me not forth from Thy face” (ver. 11). Turn away Thy face from my sins: and
“cast me not forth from Thy face.” Whose face he feareth, upon the face of the Same he
calleth. “And Thy Holy Spirit take not away from me.” For in one confessing there is the
Holy Spirit. Even now, to the gift of the Holy Spirit it belongeth, that what thou hast done
displeaseth thee. The unclean spirit sins do please; the Holy One they displease. Though
then thou still implore pardon, yet thou art joined to God on the other part, because the
evil thing that thou hast committed displeaseth thee: for the same thing displeaseth both

thee and Him. Now, to assail thy fever, ye are two, thou and the Physician. For the reason
that there cannot be confession of sin and punishment of sin in a man of himself: when one
is angry with himself, and is displeasing to himself, then it is not without the gift of the Holy
Spirit, nor doth he say, Thy Holy Spirit give to me, but, “Take not away from me.”

had; what by sinning I had lost: to wit, of Thy Christ. For who without Him can be made
whole? Because even before that He was Son of Mary, “In the beginning He was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;”1864 and so, by the holy fathers a future
dispensation of flesh taken upon Him, was looked for;1865 as is believed by us to have been
done. Times are changed, not faith. “And with Principal Spirit confirm me.” Some have
here understood the Trinity in God, Itself God; the dispensation of Flesh being excepted
therefrom: since it is written, “God is a Spirit.”1866 For that which is not body, and yet is,
seemeth to exist in such sort as that it is spirit. Therefore some understand here the Trinity
spoken of: “In upright Spirit,” the Son; in “Holy Spirit,” Holy Ghost; in “Principal Spirit,”
Father.1867 It is not any heretical opinion, therefore, whether this be so, or whether “upright
Spirit” He would have to be taken of man himself (when He saith, “An upright spirit renew
in my inner parts”), which I have bowed and distorted by sinning, so that in that case the
Holy Spirit be Himself the Principal Spirit: which also he would not have to be taken away
from him, and thereby would have himself to be confirmed therein.
18. But see what he annexeth: “With Principal Spirit,” he saith, “confirm Thou me.”
Wherein “confirm”? Because Thou hast pardoned me, because I am secure, that what Thou
hast forgiven is not to be ascribed, on this being made secure and with this grace confirmed,
therefore I am not ungrateful. But I shall do what? “I would teach unrighteous men Thy
ways” (ver. 13). Being myself of the unrighteous1868 (that is, one that was myself an unright-
eous man, now no longer unrighteous; the Holy Spirit not having been taken away from
me, and I being confirmed with Principal Spirit). “I would teach unrighteous men Thy
ways.” What ways wilt thou teach unrighteous men? “And ungodly men to Thee shall be
converted.” If David’s sin is counted for ungodliness, let not ungodly men despair of
themselves, forasmuch as God hath spared an ungodly man; but let them take heed that to
Him they be converted, that His ways they learn. But if David’s deed is not counted for un-
godliness, but this is properly call ungodliness, namely, to apostatize from God, not to

worship one God, or never to have worshipped, or to have forsaken, Him whom one did
worship, then what he saith hath the force of superabundance, “And ungodly men shall to
Thee be converted.” So full art thou of the fatness of mercy, that for those converted to Thee,
not only sinners of any sort, but even ungodly, there is no cause for despair. Wherefore?
That believing on Him that justifieth an ungodly man, their faith may be counted for
righteousness.1869
19. “Deliver me from bloods, O God, God of my health” (ver. 14). The Latin translator
hath expressed, though by a word not Latin, yet an accuracy from the Greek.1870 For we all
know that in Latin, sanguines (bloods) are not spoken of, nor yet sanguina (bloods in the
neuter), nevertheless because the Greek translator hath thus used the plural number, not
without reason, but because he found this in the original language the Hebrew, a godly
translator hath preferred to use a word not Latin, rather than one not exact. Wherefore then
hath he said in the plural number, “From bloods”? In many bloods, as in the origin of the
sinful flesh, many sins he would have to be understood. The Apostle having regard to the
very sins which come of the corruption of flesh and blood, saith, “Flesh and blood shall not
possess the kingdom of God.”1871 For doubtless, after the true faith of the same Apostle,
that flesh shall rise again and shall itself gain incorruption, as He saith Himself, “This cor-
ruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.”1872 Because then
this corruption is of sin, by the name thereof sins are called. In like manner as both that
morsel of flesh and member which playeth in the mouth when we articulate words is called
a tongue, and that is called a tongue which by the tongue is made, so we call one tongue the
Greek, another the Latin; for the flesh is not diverse, but the sound. In the same manner,
then, as the speech which is made by the tongue is called a tongue; so also the iniquity which
is made by blood is called blood. Heeding, then, his many iniquities, as1873 in the expression
above,1874 “And all my iniquities blot out,” and ascribing them to the corruption of flesh
and blood, “Free me,” he saith, “from bloods:” that is, free me from iniquities, cleanse me
from all corruption.…Not yet is the substance, but certain hope. “And my tongue shall exult
of Thy righteousness.”
20. “O Lord, my lips Thou shalt open, and my mouth shall tell of Thy praise” (ver. 15).
“Thy praise,” because1875 I have been created: “Thy praise,” because sinning I have not been

forsaken: “Thy praise,” because I have been admonished to confess: “Thy praise,” because
in order that I might be secured I have been cleansed.
21. “Because if Thou hadst willed sacrifice, I would have given it surely” (ver. 16). David
was living at that time when sacrifices of victim animals were offered to God, and he saw
these times that were to be. Do we not perceive ourselves in these words? Those sacrifices
were figurative, foretelling the One Saving Sacrifice. Not even we have been left without a
Sacrifice to offer to God. For hear what he saith, having a concern for his sin, and wishing
the evil thing which he hath done to be forgiven him: “If Thou hadst willed,” he saith, “sac-
rifice, I would have given it surely. With holocausts Thou wilt not be delighted.” Nothing
shall we therefore offer? So shall we come to God? And whence shall we propitiate Him?
Offer; certainly in thyself thou hast what thou mayest offer. Do not from without fetch
frankincense,1876 but say, “In me are, O God, Thy vows, which I will render of praise to
Thee.”1877 Do not from without seek cattle to slay, thou hast in thyself what thou mayest
kill. “Sacrifice to God is a spirit troubled, a heart contrite and humbled God despiseth not”
(ver. 17). Utterly he despiseth bull, he-goat, ram: now is not the time that these should be
offered. They were offered when they indicated something, when they promised something;
when the things promised come, the promises are taken away. “A heart contrite and humbled
God despiseth not.” Ye know that God is high: if thou shalt have made thyself high, He will
be from thee; if thou shalt have humbled thyself, He will draw near to thee.
22. See who this is: David as one man was seeming to implore; see ye here our image
and the type of the Church.
“Deal kindly, O Lord, in Thy good will with Sion” (ver. 18). With this Sion deal kindly.
What is Sion? A city holy. What is a city holy? That which cannot be hidden, being upon a
mountain established. Sion in prospect, because it hath prospect of something which it hopeth
for. For Sion is interpreted “prospect,” and Jerusalem, “vision of peace.” Ye perceive then
yourselves to be in Sion and in Jerusalem, if being sure ye look for hope that is to be, and if
ye have peace with God. “And be the walls of Jerusalem builded.” “Deal kindly, O Lord, in
Thy good will with Sion, and be the walls of Jerusalem builded.” For not to herself let Sion
ascribe her merits: do Thou with her deal kindly, “Be the walls of Jerusalem builded:” be the
battlements of our immortality laid, in faith and hope and charity.
23. “Then Thou shalt accept the sacrifice of righteousness” (ver. 19). But now sacrifice
for iniquity, to wit, a spirit troubled, and a heart humbled; then the sacrifice of righteousness,
praises alone. For, “Blessed they that dwell in Thy house, for ever and ever they shall praise

Thee:”1878 for this is the sacrifice of righteousness. “Oblations and holocausts.” What are
“holocausts”? A whole victim by fire consumed. When a whole beast was laid upon the altar
with fire to be consumed, it was called a holocaust. May divine fire take us up whole, and
that fervour catch us whole. What fervour? “Neither is there that hideth himself from the
heat thereof.”1879 What fervour? That whereof speaketh the Apostle: “In spirit fervent.”1880
Be not merely our soul taken up by that divine fire of wisdom, but also our body; that1881
it may earn their immortality; so be it lifted up for a holocaust, that death be swallowed into
victory. “Oblations and holocausts.” “Then shall they lay upon thine altar calves.” Whence
“calves”? What shall He therein choose? Will it be the innocence of the new age, or necks
freed from the yoke of the law?…

Psalm LI
Psalm LII.1882
1. The title of the Psalm hath: “At the end, understanding of David, when there came
Doeg the Edomite and told Saul, David hath come into the house of Abimelech:” whereas
we read that he had come into the house of Achimelech. And it may chance that we do not
unreasonably suppose, that because of the similarity of a name and the difference of one
syllable, or rather of one letter, the titles have been varied. In the manuscripts, however, of
the Psalms, when we looked into them, rather Abimelech we have found than Achimelech.
And since in another place thou hast a most evident Psalm, intimating not a dissimilarity
of name, but an utterly different name; when, for instance, David changed his face before
King Achish, not before king Abimelech, and he sent him away, and he departed: and yet
the title of the Psalm is thus written, “When he changed his countenance in the presence of
Abimelech”1883—the very change of name maketh us the rather intent upon a mystery, lest
thou shouldest pursue the quasi-facts of history, and despise the sacred veilings.…
2. Observe ye two kinds of men; the one of men labouring, the other of those among
whom they labour: the one of men thinking of earth, the other of heaven: the one of men
weighing down their heart unto the deep, the other of men with Angels their heart conjoining:
the one trusting in earthly things, wherein this world aboundeth, the other confiding in
heavenly things, which God, who lieth not, hath promised. But mingled are these kinds of
men. We see now the citizen of Jerusalem, citizen of the kingdom of heaven, have some office
upon earth: to wit, one weareth purple, is a Magistrate, is Ædile, is Proconsul, is Emperor,
doth direct the earthly republic: but he hath his heart above, if he is a Christian, if he is a
believer, if he is godly, if he is despising those things wherein he is, and trusteth in that
wherein he is not yet. Of which kind was that holy woman Esther, who, though she was wife
of a king, incurred the danger of interceding for her countrymen: and when she was praying
before God, where she could not lie, in her prayer said, that her royal ornaments were to
her but as the cloth of a menstruous woman.1884 Despair we not then of the citizens of the
kingdom of heaven, when we see them engaged in any of Babylon’s matters, doing something
earthly in republic earthly: nor again let us forthwith congratulate all men that we see doing
matters heavenly; because even the sons of pestilence sit sometimes in the seat of Moses, of
whom is said, “What things they say, do ye: but what things they do, do not: for they say,
and do not.”1885 Those, amid earthly things, lift up heart unto heaven, these, amid heavenly
words, trail heart upon earth. But there will come time of winnowing, when both are to be
severed with greatest diligence, in order that no grain may pass over unto the heap of chaff

that is to be burned, that not one single straw may pass over to the mass that is to be stored
in the barn.1886 So long as then now it is mingled, hear we thence our voice, that is, voice
of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven (for to this we ought to aspire, to bear with evil
men here, rather than be borne with by good men): and let us conjoin ourselves to this voice,
both with ear and with tongue, and with heart and work. Which if we shall have done, we
are here speaking in those things which we hear. Let us therefore speak first of the evil body
of kingdom earthly.
3. “Why doth he glory in malice that is mighty?” (ver. 1). Observe, my brethren, the
glorying of malignity, the glorying of evil men. Where is glorying? “Why doth he glory in
malice that is mighty?” That is, he that in malice is mighty, why doth he glory? There is need
that a man be mighty, but in goodness, not in malice. Is it any great thing to glory in malice?
To build a house doth belong to few men, any ignorant man you please can pull down. To
sow wheat, to dress the crop, to wait until it ripen, and in that fruit on which one has laboured
to rejoice, doth belong to few men: with one spark any man you please can burn all the crop.
To breed an infant, when born to feed him, to educate, to bring him on to youth’s estate, is
a great task: to kill him in one moment of time any one you please is able. Therefore those
things which are done for destruction, are most easily done. “He that glorieth, let him glory
in the Lord:”1887 he that glorieth, let him glory in goodness. Thou gloriest, because thou art
mighty in evil. What art thou about to do, O mighty man, what art thou about to do,
boasting thyself much? Thou art about to kill a man: this thing also a scorpion, this also one
fever, this also a poisonous fungus can do. To this is thy mightiness reduced, that it be made
equal to a poisonous fungus? This therefore do the good citizens of Jerusalem, who not in
malice but in goodness glory: firstly, that not in themselves, but in the Lord they glory.
Secondly, that those things which make for edification they earnestly do, and do such things
as are strong to abide: but things which make for destruction they may do, for the discipline
of men advancing, not for the oppression of the innocent. To this mightiness then that
earthly body being compared, why may it not hear out of these words, “Why doth he glory
in malice that is mighty?”
4. “In iniquity the whole day upon injustice hath thy tongue thought” (ver. 2): that is,
in the whole of time, without weariness, without intermission, without cessation. And when
thou doest not, thou thinkest; so that when anything of evil is away from thy hands, from
thy heart it is not away; either thou doest an evil thing, or while thou canst not do, thou
sayest an evil thing, that is, thou evil-speakest: or when not even this thou canst do, thou
willest and thinkest an evil thing. “The whole day,” then, that is, without intermission. We
expect punishment to this man. Is he to himself a small punishment? Thou threatenest him:
1886 Matt. iii. 12.
1887 1 Cor. i. 31.
Psalm LII
thou, when thou threatenest him, wilt send him whither? Unto evil? Send him away unto
himself. In order that thou mayest vent much rage, thou art going to give him into the power
of beasts: unto himself he is worse than beasts. For a beast can mangle his body: of himself
he cannot leave his heart whole. Within, against himself he doth rage of himself, and dost
thou from without seek for stripes? Nay, pray God for him, that he may be set free from
himself. Nevertheless in this Psalm, my brethren, there is not a prayer for evil men, or against
evil men, but a prophecy of what is to result to evil men. Think not therefore that the Psalm
of ill-will saith anything: for it is said in the spirit of prophecy.
5. There followeth then what? All thy might and all thy thought of iniquity all the day,
and meditation of malignity in thy tongue without intermission, hath performed what, done
what? “As with a sharp razor thou hast done deceit” (ver. 3). See what do evil men to Saints,
they scrape their hair. What is it that I have said? If there be such citizens of Jerusalem, that
hear the voice of their Lord, of their King, saying, “Fear not them which kill the body, but
are not able to kill the soul:” that hear the voice which but now from the Gospel hath been
read, “What doth it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and of himself make
wreck:”1888 they despise all present good things, and above all life itself. And what is Doeg’s
razor to do to a man on this earth meditating on the kingdom of heaven, and about to be
in the kingdom of heaven, having with him God, and about to abide with God? What is that
razor to do? Hair it is to scrape, it is to make a man bald. And this belongeth to Christ, who
in the Place of a Skull was crucified.1889 It maketh also the son of Core, which is interpreted
baldness.1890 For this hair signifieth a superfluity of things temporal. Which hairs indeed
are not made by God superfluously on the body of men, but for a sort of ornament: yet be-
cause without feeling they are cut off, they that cleave to the Lord with their heart, so have
these earthly things as they have hair. But sometimes even something of good with “hair”
is wrought, when thou breakest bread to the hungry, the poor without roof thou bringest
into thy house; if thou shalt have seen one naked, thou coverest him:1891 lastly, the Martyrs
themselves also imitating the Lord, blood for the Church shedding, hearing that voice, “As
Christ laid down His life for us, so also ought we also to lay down for the brethren,”1892 in
a certain way with their hair did good to us, that is, with those things which that razor can
lop off or scrape. But that therefore even with the very hair some good can be done, even
that woman a sinner intimated, who, when she had wept over the feet of the Lord, with her
hair wiped what with tears she wetted.1893 Signifying what? That when thou shalt have pitied

1893 Luke vii. 38.
Psalm LII
any one, thou oughtest to relieve him also if thou canst. For when thou hast pity, thou
sheddest as it were tears: when thou relievest, thou wipest with hair. And if this to any one,
how much more to the feet of the Lord. The feet of the Lord are what? The holy Evangelists,
whereof is said, “How beautiful are the feet of them that tell of peace, that tell of good
things!”1894 Therefore like a razor let Doeg whet his tongue, let him whet deceit as much
as he may: he will take away superfluous temporal things; will he necessary things everlasting?
6. “Thou hast loved malice above benignity” (ver. 4). Before thee was benignity; herself
thou shouldest have loved. For thou wast not going to expend anything, nor wast thou going
to fetch something to love by a distant voyage. Benignity is before thee, iniquity before thee:
compare and choose. But perchance thou hast an eye wherewith thou seest malignity, and
hast no eye wherewith thou seest benignity. Woe to the iniquitous heart. What is worse, it
doth turn away itself, that it may not see what it is able to see. For what of such hath been
said in another place? “He would not understand that he might do good.”1895 For it is not
said, he could not: but “he would not,” he saith, “understand that he might do good,” he
closed his eyes from present light. And what followeth? “Of iniquity he hath meditated in
his bed;” that is, in the inner secrecy of his heart. Some reproach of this kind is heaped upon
this Doeg the Edomite, a malignant body, a motion of earth, not abiding, not heavenly.
“Thou hast loved malignity above benignity.” For wilt thou know how an evil man doth see
both, and the former he doth rather choose, from the other doth turn himself away?
Wherefore doth he cry out when he suffereth anything unjustly? Wherefore doth he then
exaggerate as much as he can the iniquity, and praise benignity, censuring him that hath
wrought in him malignity above benignity? Be he then a rule to himself for seeing: out of
himself he shall be judged. Moreover, if he do what is written, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself;” 1896 and, “Whatsoever good things ye will that men should do unto you, these
also do ye do unto them:”1897 at home he hath means of knowing, because what on himself
he will not have to be done, he ought not to do to another. “Thou hast loved malice above
benignity.” Iniquitously, inordinately, perversely thou wouldest raise water above oil:1898
the water will be sunk, the oil will remain above. Thou wouldest under darkness place a
light: the darkness will be put to flight, the light will remain. Above heaven thou wouldest
place earth, by its weight the earth will fall into its place. Thou therefore wilt be sunk by
loving malice above benignity. For never will malice overcome benignity. “Thou hast loved
malice above benignity: iniquity more than to speak of equity.” Before thee is equity, before
1894 Isa. lii. 7; Rom. x. 15.
1895 Ps. xxxvi. 4.
1896 Matt. xxii. 39.
1897 Matt. vii. 12.
1898 See. S. Chrys. on 1 Thess. Hom. xi.
Psalm LII
thee is iniquity: one tongue thou hast, whither thou wilt thou turnest it: wherefore then
rather to iniquity and not to equity? Food of bitterness dost thou not give to thy belly, and
food of iniquity dost thou give to thy malignant tongue? As thou choosest whereon to live,
so choose what thou mayest speak. Thou preferrest iniquity to equity, and preferrest malice
to benignity; thou indeed preferrest, but above what can ever be but benignity and equity?
But thou, by placing thyself in a manner upon those things which it is necessary should go
beneath, wilt not make them to be above good things, but thou with them wilt be sunk unto
evil things.
7. Because of this there followeth in the Psalm, “Thou hast loved all words of sinking
under” (ver. 5). Rescue therefore thyself, if thou canst, from sinking under. From shipwreck
thou art fleeing, and dost embrace lead! If thou wilt not sink, catch at a plank, be borne on
wood, let the Cross carry thee through. But now because thou art a Doeg the Edomite, a
“motion,” and “of earth,” thou doest what? “Thou hast loved all words of sinking-under, a
tongue deceitful.” This hath preceded, words of sinking-under have followed a tongue de-
ceitful. What is a tongue deceitful? A minister of guile is a tongue deceitful, of men bearing
one thing in heart, another thing from mouth bringing forth. But in these is overthrowing,
in these sinking under.
8. “Wherefore God shall destroy thee at the end” (ver. 6): though now thou seemest to
flourish like grass in the field before the heat of the sun. For, “All flesh is grass, and the
brightness of man as the bloom of grass: the grass hath withered, and the bloom hath fallen
down: but the word of the Lord abideth for everlasting.”1899 Behold that to which thou
mayest bind thyself, to what1900 “abideth for everlasting.” For if to grass, and to the bloom
of grass, thou shalt have bound thyself, since the grass shall wither, and the bloom shall fall
down, “God shall destroy thee at the end:” and if not now, certainly at the end He shall
destroy, when that winnowing shall have come, and the heap of chaff from the solid grain
shall have been separated.1901 Is not the solid grain for the barns, and the chaff for the fire?
Shall not the whole of that Doeg stand at the left hand, when the Lord is to say, “Go ye into
fire everlasting, which hath been prepared for the devil and his angels”?1902 Therefore “God
shall destroy at the end: shall pluck thee out, and shall remove thee from thy dwelling.” Now
then this Doeg the Edomite is in a dwelling: “But a servant abideth not in the house for
ever.”1903 Even he worketh something of good, even if not with his doings, at least with the
1899 Isa. xl. 6–8.
1900 Al. “to the Word that.”
1901 Matt. iii. 12, xiii. 40.
1902 Matt. xxv. 41.
1903 John viii. 35.
Psalm LII
words of God, so that in the Church, when he “seeketh his own,”1904 he would say, at least,
those things which are of Christ.
“But He shall remove thee from thy dwelling.” “Verily, verily, I say unto you, they have
received their reward.”1905 “And thy root from the land of the living.” Therefore in the land
of the living we ought to have root. Be our root there. Out of sight is the root: fruits may be
seen, root cannot be seen. Our root is our love, our fruits are our works: it is needful that
thy works proceed from love, then is thy root in the land of the living. Then shall be rooted
up that Doeg, nor any wise shall he be able there to abide, because neither more deeply there
hath he fixed a root:1906 but it shall be with him in like manner as it is with those seeds on
the rock, which even if a root they throw out, yet, because moisture they have not, with the
risen sun forthwith do wither. But, on the other hand, they that fix a root more deeply, hear
from the Apostle what? “I bow my knees for you to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
ye may be in love rooted and grounded.” And because there now is root, “That ye may be
able,” he saith, “to comprehend what is the height, and breadth, and length, and depth: to
know also the supereminent knowledge of the love of Christ, that ye may be filled unto all
the fulness of God.”1907 Of such fruits so great a root is worthy, being so single, so budding,
for buddings so deeply grounded. But truly this man’s root shall be rooted up from the land
of the living.
9. “And the just shall see, and shall fear; and over him they shall laugh” (ver. 7). Shall
fear when? Shall laugh when? Let us therefore understand, and make a distinction between
those two times of fearing and laughing, which have their several uses. For so long as we
are in this world, not yet must we laugh, lest hereafter we mourn. We have read what is re-
served at the end for this Doeg, we have read and because we understand and believe, we
see but fear. This, therefore, hath been said, “The just shall see, and shall fear.” So long as
we see what will result at the end to evil men, wherefore do we fear? Because the Apostle
hath said, “In fear and trembling work out your own salvation:”1908 because it hath been
said in a Psalm,1909 “Serve the Lord in fear, and exult unto Him with trembling.” Wherefore
“with fear”? “Wherefore let him that thinketh himself to stand, see that he fall not.”1910
Wherefore “with trembling”? Because he saith in another place: “Brethren, if a man shall
have been overtaken in any delinquency, ye that are spiritual instruct such sort in the spirit

Psalm LII
of gentleness; heeding thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”1911 Therefore, the just that are
now, that live of faith, so see this Doeg, what to him is to result, that nevertheless they fear
also for themselves: for what they are to-day, they know; what to-morrow they are to be,
they know not. Now, therefore, “The just shall see, and they shall fear.” But when shall they
laugh? When iniquity shall have passed over; when it shall have flown over; as now to a
great degree hath flown over the time uncertain; when shall have been put to flight the
darkness of this world, wherein now we walk not but by the lamp of the Scriptures, and
therefore fear as though in night. For we walk by prophecy; whereof saith the Apostle Peter,
“We have a more sure prophetic word, to which giving heed ye do well, as to a lamp shining
in a dark place, until the day shine, and the day-star arise in your hearts.”1912 So long then
as by a lamp we walk, it is needful that with fear we should live. But when shall have come
our day, that is, the manifestation of Christ, whereof the same Apostle saith, “When Christ
shall have appeared, your life, then ye also shall appear with Himself in glory,”1913 then the
just shall laugh at that Doeg.…
10. But what shall they then say that shall laugh? “And over him they shall laugh; and
shall say, Behold a man that hath not set God for his helper” (ver. 8). See ye the body earthly!
“As much as thou shalt have, so great shalt thou be,” is a proverb of covetous men, of
grasping men, of men oppressing the innocent, of men seizing upon other men’s goods, of
men denying things entrusted to their care. Of what sort is this proverb? “As much as thou
shalt have, so great shalt thou be;” that is, as much as thou shalt have had of money, as much
as thou shalt have gotten, by so much the more mighty shalt thou be. “Behold a man that
hath not set God for his helper, but hath trusted in the multitude of his riches.” Let not a
poor man, one perchance that is evil, say, I am not of this body. For he hath heard the
Prophet saying, “He hath trusted in the multitude of his riches:” forthwith if he is poor, he
heedeth his rags, he hath observed near him perchance a rich man among the people of God
more richly apparelled, and he saith in his heart, Of this man he speaketh; doth he speak of
me? Do not thence except thyself, do not separate thyself, unless thou shalt have seen and
feared, in order that thou mayest hereafter laugh. For what doth it profit thee, if thou dost
want means, and thou burnest with cupidity? When our Lord Jesus Christ to that rich man
that was grieved, and that was departing from Him, had said, “Go, sell all that thou hast,
and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me:”1914 and
great hopelessness for rich men foretold, so that He said, more easily could a camel pass
through the eye of a needle, than a rich man enter into the kingdom of Heaven,1915 were

not forthwith the disciples grieved, saying with themselves, “Who shall be able to be saved?”
Therefore when they were saying, “Who shall be able to be saved?” did they think of the few
rich men, did there escape them so great a multitude of poor men? Could they not say to
themselves, If it is hard, aye an impossible thing, that rich men should enter into the kingdom
of heaven, as it is impossible that a camel should enter through the eye of a needle, let all
poor men enter into the kingdom of heaven, be the rich alone shut out? For how few are
the rich men? But of poor men are thousands innumerable. For not the coats are we to look
upon in the kingdom of heaven; but for every one’s garment shall be reckoned the effulgence
of righteousness: there shall be therefore poor men equal to Angels of God, clothed with
the stoles of immortality, they shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father: what
reason is there for us about a few rich men to be concerned, or distressed? This thought not
the Apostles; but when the Lord had spoken this, “It is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:” they saying to
themselves, “Who shall be able to be saved,” meant what? Not means, but desires; for they
saw even poor men themselves, even if not having money, yet to have covetousness. And
that ye may know, that not money in a rich man, but covetousness is condemned, attend
to what I say; Thou observest that rich man standing near thee, and perchance in him is
money, and is not covetousness; in thee is not money, and is covetousness. A poor man full
of sores, full of woe, licked by dogs, having no help, having no morsel, not having perchance
a mere garment, was borne by the Angels unto Abraham’s bosom.1916 Ho! being a poor
man, art thou glad now; for are even sores by thee to be desired? Is not thy patrimony
soundness? There is not in this Lazarus the merit of poverty, but that of godliness. For thou
seest who was borne up, thou seest not whither he was borne up. Who was borne up by
Angels? A poor man, full of woe, full of sores. Whither was he borne up? Unto Abraham’s
bosom. Read the Scriptures, and thou shall find Abraham to have been a rich man. 1917 In
order that thou mayest know, that not riches are blamed; Abraham had much gold, silver,
cattle, household, was a rich man, and unto his bosom Lazarus, a poor man, was borne up.
Unto bosom of rich man, poor man: are not rather both unto God rich men, both in cupidity
poor men?…
11. Therefore that man having been condemned that “hath trusted in the multitude of
his riches, and hath prevailed in his vanity:” for what more vain, than he that thinketh coin
more to avail than God? Therefore that man having been condemned that said, blessed of
the people to whom these things are: thou that sayest, “Blessed the people of whom is the
Lord their own God,” dost think of thyself what? dost hope for thyself what? “But I;” now
at length hear that body: “But I am like an olive, fruit-bearing in the house of God” (ver. 9).
1916 Luke xvi. 22.
1917 Gen. xiii. 2.
Psalm LII
Not one man speaketh, but that olive fruit-bearing, whence have been pruned the proud
branches, and the humble wild olive graffed in.1918 “Like an olive, fruit-bearing in the house
of God, I have trusted in the mercy of God.” He did what? “In the multitude of his riches:”
therefore his root shall be plucked out from the land of the living. “But I,” because “like an
olive, fruit-bearing in the house of God,” the root whereof is nourished, is not rooted out,
“have trusted in the mercy of God.” But perchance now? For even herein men err sometimes.
God indeed they worship, and are not now like to that Doeg: but though on God they rely,
it is for temporal things nevertheless; so that they say to themselves, I worship my God, who
will make me rich upon earth, who to me will give sons, who to me will give a wife. Such
things indeed giveth none but God, but God would not have Himself for the sake of such
things to be loved. For to this end oftentimes those things He giveth even to evil men, in
order that some other thing good men of Him may learn to seek. In what manner then
sayest thou, “I have trusted in the mercy of God”? Perchance for obtaining temporal things?
Nay but, “For everlasting and world without end.” The expression, “For everlasting,” he
willed to repeat by adding, “world without end,” in order that by there repeating he might
affirm how rooted he was in the love of the kingdom of heaven, and in the hope of everlasting
felicity.
12. “I will confess to Thee for ever, because Thou hast done” (ver. 10). “Hast done what?”
Doeg Thou hast condemned, David Thou hast crowned. “I will confess to Thee for ever,
because Thou hast done.” Great confession, “Because thou hast done”! “Hast done” what?
except these very things which above have been spoken of, that like an olive fruit-bearing
in the house of God, I should trust in the mercy of God for everlasting and world without
end? Thou hast done: an ungodly man cannot justify himself. But who is He that justifieth?
“Believing,” he saith, “on Him” that justifieth “the ungodly.”1919 “For what hast thou which
thou hast not received? But if thou hast received, why dost thou glory as if thou hast not
received, as if of thyself thou hast?”1920 Be it far from me that I should so glory, saith he,
that is opposed against Doeg, that beareth with Doeg upon earth, until he remove from his
dwelling, and be rooted up from the land of the living. I glory not as if I have not received,
but in God I glory. “And I will confess to Thee because Thou hast done,” that is, because
Thou hast done not according to my merits, but according to Thy mercy. But I have done
what? If thou recollectest, “Before, I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.”
But thou, what hast thou done? “But mercy I have obtained, because ignorant I did it.”1921
“I will confess to Thee for ever, because Thou hast done.”

Psalm LII
13. “And I will look for Thy name, for it is pleasant.” Bitter is the world, but Thy name
is pleasant. Even if certain sweet things are in the world, yet with bitterness they are digested.
Thy name is preferred, not only for greatness but also for pleasantness. “For unjust men
have told to me their delights, but it is not as Thy law, O Lord.”1922 For if there were nothing
sweet to the Martyrs, they would not have suffered with equanimity so great bitterness of
tribulations. Their bitterness by any one was experienced, their sweetness easily could no
one taste. The name of God therefore is pleasant to men loving God above all pleasantnesses.
“I will look for Thy name, for it is pleasant.” And to what dost Thou prove that it is pleasant?
Give me a palate to which it is pleasant. Praise honey as much as thou art able, exaggerate
the sweetness thereof with what words thou shalt have the power: a man knowing not what
honey is, unless he shall have tasted, what thou sayest knoweth not. Therefore the rather to
the proof the Psalm inviting thee saith what? “Taste and see that sweet is the Lord.”1923
Taste thou wilt not, and thou sayest, Is it pleasant? What is pleasant? If thou hast tasted, in
thy fruit be it found, not in words alone, as it were only in leaves, lest by the curse of the
Lord, to wither like that fig-tree1924 thou shouldest deserve. “Taste,” he saith, “and see, that
sweet is the Lord.” Taste and see: then ye shall see, if ye shall have tasted. But to a man not
tasting, how provest thou? By praising the pleasantness of the name of God, whatsoever
things thou shalt have said are words: something else is taste. The words of His praise there
hear even the ungodly, but none taste how sweet it is, but the Saints. Further, a man discern-
ing the sweetness of the name of God, and wishing to unfold and wishing to show the same,
and not finding persons to whom he may unfold it; for to the Saints there is no need that
he show it, because they even of themselves taste and know, but the ungodly cannot discern
what they will not taste: doth, I say, what, because of the sweetness of the name of God? He
hath borne him forthwith away from the crowds of the ungodly. “And I will look,” he saith,
“for Thy name, for it is pleasant, in the sight of Thy Saints.” Pleasant is Thy name, but not
in the sight of the ungodly. I know how sweet a thing it is, but it is to them that have tasted.

Psalm LII
Psalm LIII.1925
1. Of this Psalm we undertake to treat with you, as far as the Lord supplieth us. A
brother biddeth us1926 that we may have the will, and prayeth that we may have the power.
If anything in haste perchance I shall have passed over, He that even to us deigneth to give
what we shall be enabled to say, will supply it in you. The title of it is: “At the end, for Maeleth,
understanding to David himself.” “For Maeleth,” as we find in interpretations of Hebrew
names, seemeth to say, For one travailing, or in pain. But who there is in this world that
travaileth and is in pain, the faithful acknowledge, because thereof they are. Christ here
travaileth, Christ here is in pain: the Head is above, the members below. For one not travailing
nor in pain would not say, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”1927 Him, with whom
when persecuting He was travailing, being converted, He made to travail. For he also was
himself afterwards enlightened, and grafted on those members which he used to persecute;
being pregnant with the same love, he said, “My little children, of whom again I travail,
until Christ be formed in you.”1928 For the members therefore of Christ, for His Body which
is the Church,1929 for that same One Man, that is, for that very unity, whereof the Head is
above, this Psalm is sung.…Who are they, then, amid whom we travail and groan, if in the
Body of Christ we are, if under Him, the Head, we live, if amongst His members we are
counted? Who they are, hear ye.
2. “The unwise man hath said in his heart, There is no God” (ver. 1). Such sort is it of
men amid whom is pained and groaneth the Body of Christ. If such is this sort of men, of
not many do we travail; as far as seemeth to occur to our thoughts, very few there are; and
a difficult thing it is to meet with a man that saith in his heart, “There is no God;”1930 nev-
ertheless, so few there are, that, fearing amid the many to say this, in their heart they say it,
for that with mouth to say it they dare not. Not much then is that which we are bid to endure,
hardly is it found: uncommon is that sort of men that say in their heart, “There is no God.”
But, if it be examined in another sense, is not that found to be in more men, which we sup-
posed to be in men few and uncommon, and almost in none? Let them come forth into the
midst that live evil lives, let us look into the doings of profligate, daring, and wicked men,
of whom there is a great multitude; who foster day by day their sins, who, their acts having
been changed into habit, have even lost sense of shame: this is so great a multitude of men,
that the Body of Christ, set amid them, scarce dareth to censure that which it is not con-

strained to commit, and deemeth it a great matter for itself that the integrity of innocence
be preserved in not doing that which now, by habit, either it doth not dare to blame, or if
it1931 shall have dared, there breaketh out the censure and recrimination of them that live
evil lives, more readily than the free voice of them that live good lives. And those men are
such as say in their heart, “There is no God.” Such men I am confuting. Whence confuting?
That their doings please God, they judge. He doth not therefore affirm, “some say,” but
“The unwise man hath said in his heart, There is no God.” Which men do so far believe
there is a God, that the same God they judge with what they do to be pleased. But if thou
being wise dost perceive, how “the unwise man hath said in his heart, There is no God,” if
thou give heed, if thou understand, if thou examine; he that thinketh that evil doings please
God, Him he doth not think to be God. For if God is, He is just; if He is just, injustice dis-
pleaseth Him, iniquity displeaseth. But thou, when thou thinkest that iniquity pleaseth Him,
dost deny God. For if God is one Whom iniquity displeaseth, but God seemeth not to thee
to be one whom iniquity displeaseth, and there is no God but one whom iniquity displeaseth,
then when thou sayest in thy heart, God doth countenance my iniquities, thou sayest nothing
else than, “There is no God.”
3. Let us advert also to that sense, which concerning Christ our Lord Himself, our Head
Himself, doth present itself. For when Himself in form of a servant1932 appeared on earth,
they that crucified Him said, “He is not God.” Because Son of God He was, truly God He
was. But they that are corrupted and have become abominable said what? “He is not God:”
let us slay Him, “He is not God.” Thou hast the voice of these very men in the book of
Wisdom.1933 For after there had gone before the verse, “The unwise man hath said in his
heart, There is no God;” as if reasons were required why the unwise man could say this, he
hath subjoined, “Corrupted they are, and abominable have become in their iniquities” (ver.
2). Hear ye those corrupted men. “For they have said with themselves, not rightly think-
ing:”1934 corruption beginneth with evil belief, thence it proceedeth to depraved morals,
thence to the most flagrant iniquities, these are the grades. But what with themselves said
they, thinking not rightly? “A small thing and with tediousness is our life.”1935 From this
evil belief followeth that which also the Apostle hath spoken of, “Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we shall die.”1936 But in the former passage more diffusely luxury itself is de-
scribed: “Let us crown us with roses, before they be withered; in every place let us leave the

tokens of our gladness.”1937 After the more diffuse description of that luxury, what followeth?
“Let us slay the poor just man:”1938 this is therefore saying, “He is not God.” Soft words
they seemed but now to say: “Let us crown us with roses, before they be withered.” What
more delicate, what more soft? Wouldest thou expect, out of this softness, Crosses, swords?
Wonder not, soft are even the roots of brambles; if any one handle them, he is not pricked:
but that wherewith thou shalt be pricked from thence hath birth. “Corrupted,” therefore,
are those men, “and abominable have become in their iniquities.” They say, “If Son of God
He is, let Him come down from the Cross.”1939 Behold them openly saying, “He is not
God.”…
4. “The Lord from Heaven hath looked forth upon the sons of men, that He might see
if there is one understanding and seeking after God” (ver. 3). What is this? “Corrupted they
are,” all these that say, “There is no God”? And what? Did it escape God, that they were be-
come such? Or indeed to us would their inward thought be opened, except by Him it were
told? If then He understood, if then He knew, what is this which hath been said, “that He
might see”? For the words are of one inquiring, of one not knowing. “God from Heaven
hath looked forth,” etc. And as though He had found what He sought by looking upon, and
by looking down from Heaven, He giveth sentence: “All men have gone aside, together
useless they have become: there is not one that doeth good, not so much as one” (ver. 4).
Two questions arise somewhat difficult: for if God looketh out from Heaven, in order that
He may see if there is one understanding or seeking after God; there stealeth upon an unwise
man the thought, that God knoweth not all things. This is one question: what is the other?
If there is not one that doeth good, is not so much as one; who is he that travaileth amid
bad men? The former question then is solved as followeth: ofttimes the Scripture speaketh
in such manner, that what by the gift of God a creature doth, God is said to do.…For hence
has been said the following also, “For the Spirit searcheth all things, even the depth of
God;”1940 not because He that knoweth all things searcheth, but because to thee hath been
given the Spirit, which maketh thee also to search: and that which by His own gift thou
doest, He is said to do; because without Him thou wouldest not do it: therefore God is said
to do, when thou doest.…And because this by the gift of God thou doest, God from heaven
is “looking forth upon the sons of men.” The former question then, according to our
measure, thus hath been solved.
5. What is that which looking forth we acknowledge? What is that which looking forth
God acknowledgeth? What (because here He giveth it) doth He acknowledge? Hear what
1937 Wisd. ii. 8, 9.
1938 Wisd. ii. 10.
1939 Matt. xxvii. 40.
1940 1 Cor. ii. 10.
Psalm LIII
it is; that “All have gone aside, together useless they have become: there is not one that doeth
good, there is not so much as one.” What then is that other question, but the same whereof
a little before I have made mention? If, “There is not one that doeth good, is not so much
as one,” no one remaineth to groan amid evil men. Stay, saith the Lord, do not hastily give
judgment. I have given to men to do well; but of Me, He saith, not of themselves: for of
themselves evil they are: sons of men they are, when they do evil; when well, My sons. For
this thing God doth, out of sons of men He maketh sons of God: because out of Son of God
He hath made Son of Man. See what this participation is: there hath been promised to us a
participation of Divinity: He lieth that hath promised, if He is not first made partaker of
mortality. For the Son of God hath been made partaker of mortality, in order that mortal
man may be made partaker of divinity. He that hath promised that His good is to be shared
with thee, first with thee hath shared thy evil: He that to thee hath promised divinity, showeth
in thee love. Therefore take away that men are sons of God, there remaineth that they are
sons of men: “There is none that doeth good, is not so much as one.”
6. “Shall not all know that work iniquity, that devour My people for the food of bread”?
(ver. 5).…There is therefore here a people of God that is being devoured. Nay, “There is not
one that doeth good, there is not so much as one.” We reply by the rule above. But this
people that is devoured, this people that suffereth evil men, this that groaneth and travaileth
amid evil men, now out of sons of men have been made sons of God: therefore are they de-
voured. For, “The counsel of the needy man thou hast confounded, because the Lord is his
hope.”1941 For ofttimes, in order that the people of God may be devoured, this very thing
in it is despised, that it is the people of God. I will pillage, he saith, and despoil; if he is a
Christian, what will he do to me?…But what followeth? “I will convince thee, and will set
thee before thy face.” Thou wilt not now know so as thou shouldest be displeasing to thyself,
thou shalt know so as thou mayest mourn. For God cannot but show to the unrighteous
their iniquity. If He is not to show, who will they be that are to say, “What hath profited us
pride, and what hath boasting of riches bestowed upon us?”1942 For then shall they know,
that now will not know. “Shall not all know?” etc. Why hath He added, “for the food of
bread”? As it were as bread, they eat My people. For all other things which we eat, we can
eat now these, now those; not always this vegetable, not always this flesh, not always these
apples: but always bread. What is then, “Devour My people for the food of bread”? Without
intermission, without cessation they devour.
7. “On God they have not called.” He is comforting the man that groaneth, and chiefly
by an admonition, lest by imitating evil men, who ofttimes prosper, they delight in evil doing.
There is kept for thee that which to thee hath been promised: their hope is present, thine is
1941 Ps. xiv. 6.
1942 Wisd. v. 8.
Psalm LIII
future, but theirs is transient, thine sure; theirs false, thine true. For they “upon God have
not called.” Do not daily such men ask of God? They do “not” ask of God. Give heed, if I
am able to say this by the aid of God Himself. God gratuitously will have Himself to be
worshipped, gratuitously will have Himself to be loved, that is chastely to be loved; not
Himself to be loved for the reason that He giveth anything besides Himself, but because He
giveth Himself. He then that calleth upon God in order that He may be made rich, on God
doth not call: for upon that He calleth which to himself he willeth to come.…But now thou
wouldest have coffer full, and conscience void: God filleth not coffer, but breast. What do
outward riches profit thee, if inward need presseth thee? Therefore those men that for the
sake of worldly comforts, that for the sake of earthly good things, that for the sake of present
life and earthly felicity, call upon God, do not call upon God.
8. For this reason what followeth concerning them? “There have they feared with fear,
where there was no fear” (ver. 6). For is there fear, if a man lose riches? There is no fear
there, and yet in that case men are afraid. But if a man lose wisdom, truly there is fear, and
in that case he is not afraid.…Thou hast feared to give back money, and hast willed to lose
fidelity. The Martyrs took not away property of other persons, but even their own they
despised that they might not lose fidelity: and it was too little to lose money, when they were
proscribed; they took also their life when they suffered: they lost life, in order that unto
everlasting life they might find it.1943 Therefore there they feared, where they ought to have
been afraid. But they that of Christ have said, “He is not God,” have there feared where was
no fear. For they said, “If we shall have let Him go, there will come the Romans, and will
take away from us both place and kingdom.”1944 O folly and imprudence saying in its heart,
“He is not God”! Thou hast feared to lose earth, thou hast lost Heaven: thou hast feared lest
there should come the Romans, and take away from thee place and kingdom! Could they
take away from thee God? What then remaineth? what but that thou confess, that thou hast
willed to keep, and by keeping ill hast lost? For thou hast lost both place and nation by
slaying Christ. For ye did will rather to slay Christ, than to lose place; and ye have lost place,
and nation, and Christ. In fearing, they have slain Christ: but wherefore this? “For God hath
scattered the bones of them that please men.”1945 Willing to please men, they feared to lose
their place. But Christ Himself, of whom they said, “He is not God,” willed rather to displease
such men, as they were: sons of men, not sons of God, He willed rather to displease. Thence
were scattered their bones, His bones no one hath broken. “They were confounded, for God
hath despised them.” In very deed, brethren, as far as regardeth them, great confusion hath
come to them. In the place where they crucified the Lord, whom for this cause they crucified,
1943 Matt. x. 39.
1944 John xi. 48.
1945 E.V. “that encamp against thee.”
Psalm LIII
that they might not lose both place and nation, the Jews are not. “God,” therefore, “hath
despised them:” and yet in despising He warned them to be converted. Let them now confess
Christ, and say, He is God, of whom they said, “He is not God.” Let them return to the in-
heritance of their fathers, to the inheritance of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, let them
possess with these very persons life eternal: though they have lost life temporal. Wherefore
this? Because out of sons of men have been made sons of God. For so long as they remain,
and will not, there is not one that doeth good, there is not so much as one. “They were
confounded, for God hath despised them.” And as though to these very persons He were
turned, He saith, “Who shall give out of Sion salvation to Israel?” (ver. 7). O ye fools, ye revile,
insult, buffet, besmear with spittings, with thorns ye crown, upon the Cross ye lift up; whom?
“Who shall give out of Sion salvation to Israel?” Shall not That Same of whom ye have said,
“He is not God”? “In God’s turning away the captivity of His people.” For there turneth
away the captivity of His people, no one but He that hath willed to be a captive in your own
hands. But what men shall understand this thing? “Jacob shall exult, and Israel shall rejoice.”
“Israel;” the true Jacob, and the true Israel, that younger, to whom the elder was servant,
1946 shall himself exult, for he shall himself understand.

Psalm LIII
Psalm LIV.1947
1. The title of this Psalm hath fruit in the prolixity thereof, if it be understood: and be-
cause the Psalm is short, let us make up our not having to tarry over the Psalm by tarrying
over the title. For upon this dependeth every verse which is sung. If any one, therefore, ob-
serve that which on the front of the house is fixed, secure he will enter; and, when he shall
have entered, he will not err. For this on the post itself is prominently marked, namely, in
what manner within he may not be in error. The title thereof standeth thus: “At the end, in
hymns, understanding to David himself, when there came the Ziphites, and said to Saul,
Behold, is not David hidden with us?” That Saul was persecutor of the holy man David, very
well we know: that Saul was bearing the figure of a temporal kingdom, not to life but to
death belonging, this also to your Love we remember to have imparted. And also that David
himself was bearing the figure of Christ, or of the Body of Christ, ye ought both to know
and to call to mind, ye that have already learned.1948 What then of the Ziphites? There was
a certain village, Ziph, whereof the inhabitants were Ziphites, in whose country David had
hidden himself, when Saul would find and slay him. These Ziphites then, when they had
learned this, betrayed him to the king his persecutor, saying, “Behold, is not David hidden
with us?” Of no good to them indeed was their betrayal, and to David himself of no harm.
For their evil disposition was shown: but Saul not even after their betrayal could seize David;
but rather in a certain cave in that very country, when into his hands Saul had been given
to slay, David spared him, and that which he had in his power he did not.1949 But the other
was seeking to do that which he had not in his power. Let them that have been Ziphites take
heed: let us see those whom to us the Psalm presenteth to be understood by the occasion of
those same men.
2. If we inquire then by what word is translated Ziphites, we find, “Men flourishing.”
Flourishing then were certain enemies to holy David, flourishing before him hiding. We
may find them in mankind, if we are willing to understand the Psalm. Let us find here at
first David hiding, and we shall find his adversaries flourishing. Observe David hiding: “For
ye are dead,” saith the Apostle to the members of Christ, “and your life is hid with Christ
in God.”1950 These men, therefore, that are hiding, when shall they be flourishing? “When
Christ,” he saith, “your life, shall have appeared, then ye also with Him shall appear in
glory.”1951 When these men shall be flourishing, then shall be those Ziphites withering. For
observe to what flower their glory is compared: “All flesh is grass, and the honour of flesh

as the flower of grass.”1952 What is the end? “The grass hath withered, and the flower hath
fallen off.” Where then shall be David? See what followeth: “But the Word of the Lord
abideth for ever.”…
3. These men sometimes are observed of the weak sons of light, and their feet totter,
when they have seen evil men in felicity to flourish, and they say to themselves, “Of what
profit to me is innocence? What doth it advantage me that I serve God, that I keep His
commandments, that I oppress no one, from no one plunder anything, hurt no one, that
what I can I bestow? behold, all these things I do, and they flourish, I toil.” But why?
Wouldest thou also wish to be a Ziphite? They flourish in the world, wither in judgment,
and after withering, into fire everlasting shall be cast: wouldest thou also choose this? Art
thou ignorant of what He hath promised thee, who to thee hath come, what in Himself here
He displayed? If the flower of the Ziphites were to be desired, would not Himself thy Lord
also in this world have flourished? Or indeed was there wanting to Him the power to
flourish? Nay but here He chose rather amid the Ziphites to hide, and to say to Pontius Pilate,
as if to one being himself also a flower of the Ziphites, and in suspicion about His kingdom,
“My kingdom is not of this world.”1953 Therefore here He was hidden: and all good men
are hidden here, because their good is within, it is concealed, in the heart it is, where is faith,
where charity, where hope, where their treasure is. Do these good things appear in the world?
Both these good things are hidden, and the reward of these good things is hidden.…
4. “O God, in Thy name make me safe, and in Thy virtue judge me” (ver. 1). Let the
Church say this, hiding amid the Ziphites. Let the Christian body say this, keeping secret
the good of its morals, expecting in secret the reward of its merits, let it say this: “In Thy
virtue1954 judge me.” Thou hast come, O Christ, humble Thou hast appeared, despised
Thou hast been, scourged hast been, crucified hast been, slain hast been; but, on the third
day hast risen, on the fortieth day into Heaven hast ascended: Thou sittest at the right hand
of the Father, and no one seeth: Thy Spirit thence Thou hast sent, which men that were
worthy have received; fulfilled with Thy love, the praise of that very humility of Thine
throughout the world and nations they have preached: Thy name I see to excel among
mankind, but nevertheless as weak to us hast Thou been preached. For not even did that
Teacher of the Gentiles say, that among us he knew anything, “Save Christ Jesus, and Him
crucified;”1955 in order that of Him we might choose the reproach, rather than the glory of
the flourishing Ziphites. Nevertheless, of Him he saith what? “Although He died of weakness,
yet He liveth of the power1956 of God.” He came then that He might die of weakness, He is

1953 John xviii. 36.
1954 [i.e., power or strength.—C.]
1955 1 Cor. ii. 2.

Psalm LIV
to come that He may judge in the power of God: but through the weakness of the Cross His
name hath been illustrious. Whosoever shall not have believed upon the name made illus-
trious through weakness, shall stand in awe at the Judge, when He shall have come in power.
But, lest He that once was weak, when He shall have come strong, with that fan send us to
the left hand; may He “save us in His name, and judge us in His virtue.” For who so rash as
to have desired this, as to say to God, for instance “Judge me”? Is it not wont to be said to
men for a curse, “God judge thee”? So evidently it is a curse, if He judge thee in His virtue;
and shall not have saved thee in His name: but when in name precedent He shall have saved
thee, to thy health in virtue consequent He shall judge. Be thou without care: that judgment
shall not to thee be punishment, but dividing. For in a certain Psalm 1957 thus is said: “Judge
me, O God, and divide my cause from the nation unholy.”…
5. “O God, hearken to my prayer, in Thy ears receive the words of my mouth” (ver.
2).…To Thee may my prayer attain, driven forth and darted out from the desire of Thy
eternal blessings: to Thy ears I send it forth, aid it that it may reach, lest it fall short in the
middle of the way, and fainting as it were it fall down. But even if there result not to me now
the good things which I ask, I am secured nevertheless that hereafter they will come. For
even in the case of transgressions a certain man is said to have asked of God, and not to
have been hearkened to for his good. For privations of this world had inspired him to
prayer, and being set in temporal tribulations he had wished that temporal tribulations
should pass away, and there should return the flower of grass; and he saith, “My God, my
God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”1958 The very voice of Christ it is, but for His members’
sake. “The words,” he saith, “of my transgressions I have cried to Thee throughout the day,
and Thou hast not hearkened: and by night, and not for the sake of folly to me:” that is, “and
by night I have cried, and Thou hast not hearkened; and nevertheless in this very thing that
Thou hast not hearkened, it is not for the sake of folly to me that Thou hast not hearkened,
but rather for the sake of wisdom that Thou hast not hearkened, that I might perceive what
of Thee I ought to ask. For those things I was asking which to my cost perchance I should
have received.” Thou askest riches, O man; how many have been overset through their
riches? Whence knowest thou whether to thee riches may profit? Have not many poor men
more safely been in obscurity; having become rich men, so soon as they have begun to blaze
forth, they have been a prey to the stronger? How much better they would have lain con-
cealed, how much better they would have been unknown, that have begun to be inquired
after not for the sake of what they were, but for the sake of what they had! In these temporal
things therefore, brethren, we admonish and exhort you in the Lord, that ye ask not anything
as if it were a thing settled, but that which God knoweth to be expedient for you. For what
1957 Ps. xliii. i.
1958 Ps. xxii. 1.
Psalm LIV
is expedient for you, ye know not at all. Sometimes that which ye think to be for you is
against you, and that which ye think to be against you is for you. For sick ye are; do not
dictate to the physician the medicines he may choose to set beside you. If the teacher of the
Gentiles, Paul the Apostle, saith, “For what we should pray for as we ought, we know not,”1959
how much more we? Who nevertheless, when he seemed to himself to pray wisely, namely,
that from him should be taken away the thorn of the flesh, the angel of Satan, that did buffet
him, in order that he might not in the greatness of the revelations be lifted up, heard from
the Lord what? Was that done which he wished? Nay,1960 in order to that being done which
was expedient, he heard from the Lord, I say, what? “Thrice,” he saith, “I besought the Lord
that He would take it from me; and He said to me, My Grace sufficeth for thee: for virtue
in weakness is made perfect.”1961 Salve to the wound I have applied; when I applied it I
know, when it should be taken away I know. Let not a sick man draw back from the hands
of the physician, let him not give advice to the physician. So it is with all these things tem-
poral. There are tribulations; if well thou worshippest God, thou wilt know that He knoweth
what is expedient for each man: there are prosperities; take the more heed, lest these same
corrupt thy soul, so that it withdraw from Him that hath given these things.…
6. “For aliens have risen up against me” (ver. 3). What “aliens”? Was not David himself
a Jew of the tribe of Judah? But the very place Ziph belonged to the tribe of Judah; it was of
the Jews. How then “aliens”? Not in city, not in tribe, not in kindred, but in flower.1962…But
see the Ziphites, see them for a time flourishing. With reason “alien” sons. Thou amid the
Ziphites hiding saidst what? “Blessed the people whereof the Lord is its God.” Out of this
affection this prayer1963 is being sent forth into the ears of the Lord, when it is said, “for
aliens have risen up against me.”
7. “And mighty men have sought after my soul.” For in a new manner, my brethren,
they would destroy the race of holy men, and the race of them that abstain from hoping in
this world, all they that have hope in this world. Certainly commingled they are, certainly
together they live. Very much to one another are opposed these two sorts: the one of those
that place no hope but in things secular, and in temporal felicity, and the other of those that
do firmly place their hope in the Lord God. And though concordant are these Ziphites, do
not much trust to their concord: temptations are wanting; when there shall have come any
temptation, so as that a person may be reproved for the flower of the world, I say not to thee
he will quarrel with the Bishop, but not even to the Church Herself will he draw near, lest

Psalm LIV
there fall any part of the grass.1964 Wherefore have I said these words, brethren? Because
now gladly ye all hear in the name of Christ, and according as ye understand, so ye shout
out at the word; ye would not indeed shout at it unless ye understood.1965 This your under-
standing ought to be fruitful. But whether it is fruitful, temptation doth try; lest suddenly
when ye are said to be ours, through temptation ye be found aliens, and it be said, “Aliens
have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my soul.” Be not that said which
followeth, “They have not set forth God before their face.” For when will he set God before
his face, before whose eyes there is nought but the world? namely, how he may have coin
upon coin, how flocks may be increased, how barns may be filled, how it may be said to his
soul, “Thou hast many good things, be merry, feast, take thy fill.” Doth he set before his face
Him, that unto one so boasting and so blooming with the flower of the Ziphites saith, “Fool”
(that is, “man not understanding,” “man unwise”), “this night shall be taken from thee thy
soul; all these things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?” 1966
8. “For behold, God helpeth me” (ver. 4). Even themselves know not themselves, amid
whom I am hiding. But if they too were to set God before their face, they would find in what
manner God helpeth me. For all holy men are helped by God, but within, where no one
seeth. For in like manner as the conscience of ungodly men is a great punishment, so a great
joy is the very conscience of godly men. “For our glory this is,” saith the Apostle, “the testi-
mony of our conscience.”1967 In this within, not in the flower of the Ziphites without, doth
glory that man that now saith, “For behold God helpeth me.” Surely though afar off are to
be those things which He promiseth, this day have I a sweet and present help; to-day in my
heart’s joy I find that without cause certain say, “Who doth show to us good things? For
there is signed upon us the light of Thy countenance, O Lord, Thou hast put pleasantness
into my heart.” 1968 Not into my vineyard, not into my flock, not into my cask, not into my
table, but “into my heart.” “For behold God helpeth me.” How doth He help thee? “And the
Lord is the lifter up of my soul.”
9. “Turn away evil things unto mine enemies” (ver. 5). So however green they are, so
however they flourish, for the fire they are being1969 reserved. “In Thy virtue destroy Thou
them.” Because to wit they flourish now, because to wit they spring up like grass:1970 do not
thou be a man unwise and foolish, so that by giving thought to these things thou perish for

ever and ever. For, “Turn Thou away evil things unto mine enemies.” For if thou shalt have
place in the body of David Himself, in His virtue He will destroy them. These men flourish
in the felicity of the world, perish in the virtue of God. Not in the same manner as they
flourish, do they also perish: for they flourish for a time, perish for everlasting: flourish in
unreal good things, perish in real torments. “In Thy strength destroy,” whom in Thy weakness
Thou hast endured.
10. “Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee” (ver. 6). Who can even understand this good
thing of the heart, at another’s speaking thereof, unless in himself he hath tasted it? What
is, “Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee”?… For what sacrifice here shall I take, brethren? or
what worthily shall I offer to the Lord for His mercy? Victims shall I seek from flock of
sheep, ram shall I select, for any bull in the herds shall I look out, frankincense indeed from
the land of the Sabæans shall I bring? What shall I do? What offer; except that whereof He
speaketh, “Sacrifice of praise shall honour Me”?1971 Wherefore then “voluntarily”? Because
truly I love that which I praise. I praise God, and in the self-same praise I rejoice: in the
praise of Himself I rejoice, at whom being praised, I blush not. For He is not praised in the
same manner as by those who love the theatrical follies is praised either by a charioteer, or
a hunter, or actor of any kind, and by their praisers, other praisers are invited, are exhorted,
to shout together: and when all have shouted, ofttimes, if their favourite is overcome, they
are all put to the blush. Not so is our God: be He praised with the will, loved with charity:
let it be gratuitous (or voluntary) that He is loved and that He is praised. What is “gratuitous”?
Himself for the sake of Himself, not for the sake of something else. For if thou praisest God
in order that He may give thee something else, no longer freely dost thou love God. Thou
wouldest blush, if thy wife for the sake of riches were to love thee, and perchance if poverty
should befall thee, should begin to think of adultery. Seeing that therefore thou wouldest
be loved by thy partner freely, wilt thou for anything else love God? What reward art thou
to receive of God, O covetous man? Not earth for thee, but Himself He keepeth, who made
heaven and earth. “Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee:” do it not of necessity. For if for the
sake of anything else thou praisest God, out of necessity thou praisest.…These things also
which He hath given, because of the Giver are good things. For He giveth entirely, He giveth
these temporal things: and to certain men to their good, to certain men to their harm, after
the height and depth of His judgments.…“Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee.” Wherefore
“voluntarily”? Because gratis. What is gratis? “And I will confess to Thy name, O Lord, for
it is a good thing:” for nothing else, but because a “good thing” it is. Doth he say, “I will
confess to Thy name, O Lord,” because Thou givest me fruitful manors, because Thou givest
me gold and silver, because Thou givest me extended riches, abundant money, most exalted
dignity? Nay. But what? “For it is a good thing.” Nothing I find better than Thy name.
1971 Ps. l. 23.
Psalm LIV
11. “For out of all tribulation Thou hast delivered me” (ver. 7). For this cause I have
perceived how good a thing is Thy name: for if this I were able before tribulations to acknow-
ledge, perchance for me there had been no need of them. But tribulation hath been applied
for admonition, admonition hath redounded to Thy praise. For I should not have understood
where I was, except of my weakness I had been admonished. “Out of all tribulations,”
therefore, “Thou hast delivered me. And upon mine enemies mine eye hath looked back:”
upon those Ziphites “mine eye hath looked back.” Yea, their flower I have passed over in
loftiness of heart, unto Thee I have come, and thence I have looked back upon them, and
have seen that “All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass:”1972 as in a
certain place is also said, “I have seen the ungodly man to be exalted and raised up like1973
the cedars of Lebanon: I passed by, and, lo! he was not.”1974 Wherefore “he was not”? Because
thou hast passed by. What is, “because thou hast passed by”? Because not to no purpose
hast thou heard “Lift up thy heart;” because not on earth, where thou wouldest have rotted,
thou hast remained; because thou hast lifted thy soul to God, and thou hast mounted beyond
the cedars of Lebanon, and from that elevation hast observed: and “Lo! he was not;” and
thou hast sought him, and there hath not been found place for him. No longer is labour
before thee; because thou hast entered into the sanctuary of God, and hast understood for
the last things.1975 So also here thus he concludeth. “And upon mine enemies mine eye hath
looked back.” This do ye therefore, brethren, with your souls; lift up your hearts, sharpen
the edge of your mind, learn truly to love God, learn to despise the present world, learn
voluntarily to sacrifice the offerings of praise; to the end that, mounting beyond the flower
of the grass, ye may look back upon your enemies.

Psalm LIV
Psalm LV.1976
1. Of this Psalm the title is: “At the end, in hymns, understanding to David himself.”
What the “end” is, we will briefly call to your recollection, because ye have known it. “For
the end of the Law is Christ, for righteousness unto every man believing.”1977 Be the attention
therefore directed unto the End, directed unto Christ. Wherefore is He called the end? Be-
cause whatever we do, to Him we refer it, and when to Him we shall have come home, more
to ask we shall not have. For there is an end spoken of which doth consume, there is an end
spoken of which doth make perfect. In one sense, for instance, we understand it, when we
hear, there is ended the food which was in eating; and in another sense we understand it
when we hear, there is ended the vesture which was in weaving: in each case we hear, there
is ended; but the food so that it no longer is, the vesture so that it is perfected. Our end
therefore ought to be our perfection, our perfection Christ. For in Him we are made perfect,
because of Himself the Head, the Members are we. And he hath been spoken of as “the End
of the Law,” because without Him no one doth make perfect the Law. When therefore ye
hear in the Psalms, “At the end,”—for many Psalms are thus superscribed,—be not your
thought upon consuming, but upon consummation.
2. “In hymns:” in praises. For whether we are troubled and are straitened, or whether
we rejoice and exult, He is to be praised, who both in tribulations doth instruct, and in
gladness doth comfort. For the praise of God from the heart and mouth of a Christian man
ought not to depart; not that he may be praising in prosperity, and speaking evil in adversity;
but after the manner that this Psalm doth prescribe, “I will speak good of the Lord in every
time, alway the praise of Him is in my mouth.” Thou dost rejoice; acknowledge a Father
indulging: thou art troubled; acknowledge a Father chastening. Whether He indulge, or
whether He chasten, He is instructing one for whom He is preparing an inheritance.
3. What then is, “Understanding to David himself”? David indeed was, as we know, a
holy prophet, king of Israel, son of Jesse:1978 but because out of his seed there came for our
salvation after the flesh the Lord Jesus Christ,1979 often under that name He is figured, and
David instead of Christ is in a figure set down, because of the origin of the Flesh of the Same.
For after some sort He is Son of David, after some sort He is the Lord of David; Son of
David after the flesh, Lord of David after the divinity. For if by Him have been made all
things,1980 by Him also David himself hath been made, out of whose seed He came to men.

Moreover, when the Lord had questioned the Jews, whose Son they affirmed Christ to be,
they made answer, “David’s:” where the Lord chides the Jews, when they said that He was
the Son of David.1981 He saw that they had stayed at the flesh, and had lost sight of the di-
vinity; and He reproveth them by propounding a question: “How then doth David himself
in spirit call Him Lord, ‘The Lord hath said unto my Lord.’…If then He in spirit calleth Him
Lord, how is He is Son?”1982 A question He propounded; His being Son He denied not. Ye
have heard “Lord;” say ye how He is his “Son:” ye have heard “Son;” say how He is “Lord.”
This question the Catholic Faith solveth. How “Lord”? Because “In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”1983 How “Son”? Because “The
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”1984 Because then David in a figure is Christ,
but Christ, as we have often reminded your Love, is both Head and Body; neither ought we
to speak of ourselves as alien from Christ, of whom we are members, nor to count ourselves
as if we were any other thing: because “The two shall be in one flesh.”1985 “This is a great
Sacrament,” saith the Apostle, “but I speak in regard of Christ and the Church.”1986 Because
then whole Christ is “Head and Body;” when we hear, “Understanding to David himself,”
understand we ourselves also in David. Let the members of Christ understand, and Christ
in His members understand, and the members of Christ in Christ understand: because Head
and Members are one Christ. The Head was in heaven, and was saying, “Why dost thou
persecute Me?”1987 We with Him are in heaven through hope, Himself is with us on earth
through love. Therefore “understanding to David himself.” Be we admonished when we
hear, and let the Church understand: for there belongeth to us great diligence to understand
in what evil we now are, and from what evil we desire to be delivered, remembering the
Prayer of the Lord, where at the end we say, “Deliver us from evil.”1988 Therefore amid
many tribulations of this world, this Psalm complaineth somewhat of understanding. He
lamenteth not with it, who hath not understanding. But furthermore, dearly beloved, we
ought to remember, that after the image of God we have been made, and that not in any
other part than in the understanding itself. For in many things by beasts we are surpassed:
but when a man knoweth himself to have been made after the image of God,1989 therein

something in himself he acknowledgeth to be more than hath been given to dumb animals.
But on consideration of all those things which a man hath, he findeth himself in this thing
peculiarly distinguished from a dumb animal, in that he hath himself an understanding.
Whence certain men despising in themselves that peculiar and especial thing which from
their Maker they had received, the Maker Himself reproveth, saying, “Do not become like
horse and mule, in which there is no understanding.”1990…
4. “Hear Thou, O God, my entreaty, and despise not my prayer: give heed unto me, and
hearken unto me” (ver. 1). Of one earnest, anxious, of one set in tribulation, are these words.
He is praying, suffering many things, from evil yearning to be delivered: it remaineth that
we hear in what evil he is, and when he beginneth to speak, let us acknowledge there ourselves
to be; in order that the tribulation being shared, we may conjoin prayer. “I have been made
sad in my exercise, and have been troubled” (ver. 2). Where made sad, where troubled? “In
my exercise,” he saith. Of evil men, whom he suffereth, he hath made mention, and the
same suffering of evil men he hath called his “exercise.” Think ye not that without profit
there are evil men in this world, and that no good God maketh of them. Every evil man
either on this account liveth that he may be corrected, or on this account liveth that through
him a good man may be exercised. O that therefore they that do now exercise us would be
converted, and together with us be exercised! Nevertheless, so long as they are such as to
exercise, let us not hate them: because in that wherein any one of them is evil, whether unto
the end he is to persevere, we know not; and ofttimes when to thyself thou seemest to have
been hating an enemy, thou hast been hating a brother, and knowest not. The devil and his
angels in the holy Scriptures have been manifested to us, that for fire everlasting they have
been destined. Of them only must amendment be despaired of.…Therefore since this rule
of Love for thee is fixed, that imitating the Father thou shouldest love an enemy: for, He
saith, “love your enemies:”1991 in this precept how wouldest thou be exercised, if thou hadst
no enemy to suffer? Thou seest then that he profiteth thee somewhat: and let God sparing
evil men profit thee, so that thou show mercy: because perchance thou too, if thou art a
good man, out of an evil man hast been made a good man: and if God spared not evil men,
not even thou wouldest be found to return thanks. May He therefore spare others, that hath
spared thee also. For it were not right, when thou hadst passed through, to close up the way
of godliness.
5. Whence then doth this man pray, set among evil men, with whose enmities he was
being exercised? Why saith he, “I have been made sad in my exercise, and have been
troubled”? While he is extending his love so as to love enemies, he hath been affected with
disgust, being bayed at all around by the enmities of many men, by the frenzy of many and
1990 Ps. xxxii. 9.

under a sort of human infirmity he hath sunk. He hath seen himself now begin to be pierced
through with an evil suggestion of the devil, to bring on hatred against his enemies: wrestling
against hatred in order to perfect love herself, in the very fight, and in the wrestling, he hath
been troubled. For there is his voice in another Psalm, “Mine eye hath been troubled, because
of anger.” And what followeth there? “I have waxen old among all mine enemies.”1992 As
if in storm and waves he were beginning to sink, like Peter.1993 For he doth trample the
waves of this world, that loveth enemies. Christ on the sea was walking fearless, from whose
heart there could not by any means be taken away the love of an enemy, who hanging on
the Cross did say, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”1994 Peter too
would walk. He as Head, Peter as Body: because, “Upon this rock,” He saith, “I will build
My Church.”1995 He was bidden to walk, and he was walking by the Grace of Him bidding,
not by his own strength. But when he saw the wind mighty, he feared; and then he began
to sink, being troubled in his exercise. By what mighty wind? “By the voice of the enemy,
and by the tribulation of the sinner” (ver. 3). Therefore, in the same manner as he cried out
on the waves, “Lord, I perish, save me,” 1996 a similar voice from this man hath preceded,
“Hearken unto me.” Wherefore? For what sufferest thou? Of what dost thou groan? “I have
been made sad in my exercise.” To be exercised indeed among evil men Thou hast set me,
but too much they have risen up, beyond my powers: calm Thou one troubled, stretch forth
a hand to one sinking. “For they have brought down upon me iniquity, and in anger they
were shadowing me.” Ye have heard of waves and winds: one as it were humbled they were
insulting, and he was praying: on every side against him with the roar of insult they were
raging, but he within was calling upon Him whom they did not see.…
6. But this man being troubled and made sad was praying, his eye being disturbed as it
were on account of anger.1997 But the anger of a brother if it shall have been inveterate is
then hatred. Anger doth trouble the eye, hatred doth quench it: anger is a straw, hatred is
a beam. Sometimes thou hatest and chidest an angry man: in thee is hatred, in him whom
thou chidest anger: with reason to thee is said, “Cast out first the beam from thine own eye,
and so thou shalt see to cast out the straw from thy brother’s eye.”1998 For that ye may know
how much difference there is between anger and hatred: day by day men are angry with
their sons, show me them that hate their1999 sons! This man being troubled was praying

even when made sad, wrestling against all revilings of all revilers; not in order that he might
conquer any one of them by giving back reviling, but that he might not hate any one of
them. Hence he prayeth, hence asketh: “From the voice of the enemy and from the tribulation
of the sinner.” “My heart hath been troubled in me” (ver. 4). This is the same as elsewhere
hath been said, “Mine eye because of anger hath been troubled.”2000 And if eye hath been
troubled, what followeth? “And fear of death hath fallen upon me.” Our life is love: if life is
love, death is hatred. When a man hath begun to fear lest he should hate him that he was
loving, it is death he is fearing; and a sharper death, and a more inward death, whereby soul
is killed, not body. Thou didst mind a man raging against thee; what was he to do, against
whom thine own Lord had given thee security, saying, “Fear not them that kill the body”?2001
He by raging killeth body, thou by keeping hatred hast killed soul; and he the body of another,
thou thine own soul. “Fear,” therefore, “of death hath fallen upon me.”
7. “Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and darkness hath covered me” (ver.
5). “And I have said,” “He that hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.”2002 If love is
light, hatred is darkness. And what saith to himself one set in that weakness and troubled
in that exercise? “Who shall give me wings as to a dove, and I shall fly and shall rest?” (ver.
6). Either for death he was wishing, or for solitude he was longing. So long, he saith, as this
is the work with me, as this command is given me, that I should love enemies, the revilings
of these men, increasing and shadowing me, do derange mine eye, perturb my sight, penetrate
my heart, slay my soul. I could wish to depart, but2003 weak I am, lest by abiding I should
add sins to sins: or at least may I be separated for a little space from mankind, lest my wound
suffer from frequent blows, in order that when it hath been made whole it may be brought
back to the exercise. This is what takes place, brethren, and there ariseth ofttimes in the
mind of the servant of God a longing for solitude, for no other reason than because of the
multitude of tribulations and scandals, and he saith, “Who shall give me wings?” Doth he
find himself without wings, or rather with bound wings? If they are wanting, be they given;
if bound, be they loosed; because even he that looseth a bird’s wings, either giveth, or giveth
back to it its wings. For it had not as though its own them, wherewith it could not fly. Bound
wings make a burden. “Who,” he saith, “shall give me wings as to a dove, and I shall fly and
shall rest?” Shall rest, where? I have said there are two senses here: either, as saith the Apostle,
“To be dissolved and to be with Christ, for it is by far the best thing.”2004…Even he that
amended cannot be, is thine, either by the fellowship of the human race, or ofttimes by

Church Communion; he is within, what wilt thou do? whither wilt go? whither separate
thyself, in order that these things thou mayest not suffer? But go to him, speak, exhort, coax,
threaten, reprove. I have done all things, whatever powers I had I have expended and have
drained, nothing I see have I prevailed; all my labour hath been spent out, sorrow hath re-
mained. How then shall my heart rest from such men, except I say, “Who shall give me
wings?” “As to a dove,” however, not as to a raven. A dove seeketh a flying away from
troubles, but she loseth not love. For a dove as a type of love is set forth, and in her the plaint
is loved. Nothing is so fond of plaints as a dove: day and night she complaineth, as though
she were set here where she ought to complain. What then saith this lover? Revilings of men
to bear I am unable, they roar, with frenzy are carried away, are inflamed with indignation,
in anger they shadow2005 me; to do good to them I am unable; O that I might rest somewhere,
being separated from them in body, not in love; lest in me there should be troubled love itself:
with my words and my speech no good can I do them, by praying for them perchance I shall
do good. These words men say, but ofttimes they are so bound, that to fly they are not able.
For perchance they are not bound with any birdlime, but are bound by duty. But if they are
bound with care and duty, and to leave it are unable, let them say, “I was wishing to be dis-
solved and to be with Christ, for it is by far the best thing: to abide in the flesh is necessary
because of you.”2006 A dove bound back by affection, not by cupidity, was not able to fly
away because of duty to be fulfilled, not because of little merit. Nevertheless a longing in
heart must needs be; nor doth any man suffer this longing, but he that hath begun to walk
in that narrow way:2007 in order that he may know that there are not wanting to the Church
persecutions, even in this time, when a calm is seen in the Church, at least with respect to
those persecutions which our Martyrs have suffered. But there are not wanting persecutions,
because a true saying is this, “All that will godly to live in Christ, shall suffer persecu-
tion.”2008…
8. “Behold I have gone afar fleeing, and have abode in the desert” (ver. 7). In what desert?
Wherever thou shalt be, there will gather them together other men, the desert with thee
they will seek, will attach themselves to thy life, thou canst not thrust back the society of
brethren: there are mingled with thee also evil men; still exercise is thy due portion, “Behold
I have gone afar, and have abode in the desert.” In what desert? It is perchance in the con-
science, whither no man entereth, where no one is with thee, where thou art and God. For
if in the desert, in any place, what wilt thou do with men gathering themselves together?

9. “I was looking for him that should save me from weakness of mind and tempest”
(ver. 8). Sea there is, tempest there is: nothing for thee remaineth but to cry out, “Lord, I
perish.”2010 Let Him stretch forth hand, who doth the waves tread fearlessly, let Him relieve
thy dread, let Him confirm in Himself thy security, let Him speak to thee within, and say
to thee, “Give heed to Me, what I have borne:” an evil brother perchance thou art suffering,
or an enemy without art suffering; which of these have I not suffered? There roared without
Jews, within a disciple was betraying. There rageth therefore tempest, but He doth save men
from weakness of mind, and tempest. Perchance thy ship is being troubled, because He in
thee is sleeping. The sea was raging, the bark wherein the disciples were sailing was being
tossed; but Christ was sleeping: at length it was seen by them that among them was sleeping
the Ruler2011 and Creator of winds; they drew near and awoke Christ;2012 He commanded2013
the winds, and there was a great calm. With reason then perchance thy heart is troubled,
because thou hast forgotten Him on whom thou hast believed: beyond endurance thou art
suffering, because it hath not come into thy mind what for thee Christ hath borne. If unto
thy mind cometh not Christ, He sleepeth: awake Christ, recall faith. For then in thee Christ
is sleeping, if thou hast forgotten the sufferings of Christ: then in thee Christ is watching, if
thou hast remembered the sufferings of Christ. But when with full heart thou shalt have
considered what He hath suffered, wilt not thou too with equanimity endure? and perchance
rejoicing, because thou hast been found in some likeness of the sufferings of thy King. When
therefore on these things thinking thou hast begun to be comforted and to rejoice, He hath
arisen, He hath commanded the winds; therefore there is a great calm. “I was looking for
Him that should save me from weakness of mind and tempest.”
10. “Sink, O Lord, and divide the tongues of them” (ver. 9). He is referring to men
troubling him and shadowing him, and he hath wished this thing not of anger, brethren.
They that have wickedly lifted up themselves, for them it is expedient that they be sunk.
They that have wickedly conspired, it is expedient for them that their tongues should be
divided: to good let them consent, and let their tongues agree together. But if to one pur-

pose2014 there were a whispering against me,2015 he saith, all mine enemies, let them lose
their “one purpose” in evil, divided be the tongues of them, let them not with themselves
agree together. “Sink, O Lord, and divide the tongues of them.” Wherefore “sink”? Because
themselves they have lifted up. Wherefore “divide”? Because for an evil thing they have
united. Recollect that tower of proud men made after the deluge: what said the proud men?
Lest we perish in a deluge, let us make a lofty tower.2016 In pride they were thinking them-
selves to be fortified, they builded up a lofty tower, and the Lord divided the tongues of
them. Then they began not to understand one another; hence arose the beginning of many
tongues. For before, one tongue there was: but one tongue for men agreeing was good, one
tongue for humble men was good: but when that gathering together did into a union of
pride fall headlong, God spared them; even though He divided the tongues, lest by under-
standing one another they should make a destructive unity. Through proud men, divided
were the tongues; through humble Apostles, united were the tongues. Spirit of pride dispersed
tongues, Spirit Holy united tongues. For when the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples, with
the tongues of all men they spake,2017 by all men they were understood: tongues dispersed,
into one were united. Therefore if still they rage and are Gentiles, it is expedient for them
divided to have their tongues. They would have one tongue; let them come to the Church;
because even among the diversity of tongues of flesh, one is the tongue in faith of heart.
11. “For I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.” With reason this man was
seeking the desert, for he saw iniquity and contradiction in the city. There is a certain city
turbulent: the same it was that was building a tower, the same was confounded and called
Babylon, the same through innumerable nations dispersed:2018 thence is gathered the Church
into the desert of a good conscience. For he saw contradiction in the city. “Christ
cometh.”—“What Christ?” thou contradictest.—“Son of God.”—“And hath God a Son?”
thou contradictest.—“He was born of a virgin, suffered, rose again.”—“And whence is it
possible for this to be done?” thou contradictest.—Give heed at least to the glory of the Cross
itself. Now on the brow of kings that Cross hath been fixed, over which enemies insulted.
The effect hath proved the virtue.2019 It hath subdued the world, not with steel, but with
wood. The wood of the Cross deserving of insults hath seemed to enemies, and before the
wood itself standing they were wagging the head, and saying, “If Son of God He is, let Him
come down from the Cross.”2020 He was stretching forth His hands to a people unbelieving

and contradicting. For if just he is that of faith liveth,2021 unjust he is that hath not faith.
By that which here he saith “iniquity,” I understand unbelief. The Lord therefore was seeing
in the city iniquity and contradiction, and was stretching forth His hands to a people unbe-
lieving and contradicting: and nevertheless waiting for these same, He was saying, “Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do.”2022 Even now indeed there rage the remnant
of that city, even now they contradict. From the brows of all men now He is stretching forth
hands to the remnant unbelieving and contradicting.
12. “Day and night there will compass it upon the walls thereof iniquity, and labour.”2023
“Upon the walls thereof;” upon the fortifications thereof, holding as it were the heads
thereof, the noble men thereof. If that noble man were a Christian, not one would remain
a pagan! Oft-times men say, “no one would remain a pagan, if he were a Christian.” Ofttimes
men say, “If he too were made a Christian, who would remain a pagan?” Because therefore
not yet they are made Christians, as if walls they are of that city unbelieving and contradicting.
How long shall these walls stand? Not always shall they stand. The Ark is going around the
walls of Jericho: there shall come a time at the seventh going round of the Ark, when all the
walls of the city unbelieving and contradicting shall fall.2024 Until it come to pass, this man
is being troubled in his exercise; and enduring the remains of men contradicting, he would
choose wings for flying away, would choose the rest of the desert. Yea let him continue amid
men contradicting, let him endure menaces, drink revilings, and look for Him that will save
him from weakness of mind and tempest: let him look upon the Head, the pattern for his
life,2025 let him be made calm in hope, even if he is troubled in fact. “Day and night there
will compass it upon the walls thereof iniquity; and labour in the midst thereof and injustice.”
And for this reason labour is there, because iniquity is there: because injustice is there,
therefore also labour is there. But let them hear him stretching forth hands. “Come unto
Me, all ye that labour.”2026 Ye cry, ye contradict, ye revile: He on the contrary, “Come unto
Me, all ye that labour,” in your pride, and ye shall rest in My humility. “Learn of Me,” He
saith, “for meek I am and humble in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”2027 For

13. “There hath not failed from the streets thereof usury and deceit” (ver. 11). Usury
and deceit are not hidden at least, because they are evil things, but in public they rage. For
he that in his house doth any evil thing, however for his evil thing doth blush: “In the streets
thereof usury and deceit.” Money-lending2028 even hath a profession, Money-lending also
is called a science; a corporation is spoken of, a corporation as if necessary to the state, and
of its profession it payeth revenue; so entirely indeed in the streets is that which should have
been hidden. There is also another usury worse, when thou forgivest not that which to thee
is owed; and the eye is disturbed in that verse of the prayer, “Forgive us our debts—as we
too forgive our debtors.” 2029 For what there wilt thou do, when thou art going to pray, and
coming to that same verse? An insulting word thou hast heard: thou wouldest exact the
punishment of condemnation. Do but consent to exact just so much as thou hast given,
thou usurer of injuries! With the fist thou hast been smitten, slaying thou seekest. Evil usury!
How wilt thou go to prayer? If thou shalt have left praying, which way wilt thou come round
unto the Lord? Behold thou wilt say: “Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy
Name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, as in heaven so on earth.” Thou wilt say, “Our
daily bread give us to-day.” Thou wilt come to, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors.”2030 Even in that evil city let there abound these usuries; let them not enter the
walls where the breast is smitten! What wilt thou do? because there thou and that verse
are2031 in the midst? Petitions for thee hath a heavenly Lawyer composed.2032 He that knew
what used there to be done, said to thee, “Otherwise thou shalt not obtain.” “Verily, verily,
I say unto you, that if ye shall have forgiven men sins, they shall be forgiven you; but if ye
shall not have forgiven sins unto men, neither will your Father forgive you.”2033 Who saith
this? He that knoweth what there is being done, in the place whereat thou art standing to
make request. See how Himself hath willed to be thy Advocate; Himself thy Counsellor,2034
Himself the Assessor of the Father, Himself thy Judge hath said, “Otherwise thou shalt not
receive.” What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not receive, unless thou shalt speak; wilt not receive
if falsely thou shalt speak. Therefore either thou must do and speak, or else what thou askest
thou wilt not earn; because they that this do not do, are in the midst of those evil usuries.

that thou exactest for injuries which thou hast endured? doth vengeance refresh thee?
Therefore, over the evil of another shalt thou rejoice? Thou hast suffered evil; pardon thou;

14. “For if an enemy had upbraided me” (ver. 12). And indeed above he was “troubled
in his exercise” by the voice of the enemy and by the tribulation of the sinner, perhaps being
placed in that city, that proud city that was building a tower, which was “sunk,”2037 that
divided might be the tongues: give heed to his inward groaning because of perils from false
brethren. “For if an enemy had upbraided me, I would have undergone it assuredly, and if
he that did hate me had over me spoken great words,” that is, through pride had on me
trampled, did magnify himself above me, did threaten me all in his power: “I would hide
myself assuredly from him.” From him that is abroad, thou wouldest hide thyself where?
Amid those that are within. But now see whether anything else remaineth, but that thou
seek solitude. “But thou,” he saith, “man of one mind, my guide and my friend” (ver. 13).
Perchance sometimes good counsel thou hast given, perchance sometimes thou hast gone
before me, and some wholesome advice thou hast given me: in the Church of God together
we have been. “But thou,…that together with me didst take sweet morsels” (ver. 14). What
are the sweet morsels? Not all they that are present know: but let them not be soured that
do know, in order that they may be able to say to them that as yet know not: “Taste ye and
see, how sweet is the Lord.”2038 “In the House of God we have walked with consent.” Whence
then dissension? Thou that wast within, hast become one without. He hath walked with me
in the House of God with consent: another house hath he set up against the House of God.
Wherefore hath that been forsaken, wherein we have walked with consent?2039 wherefore
hath that been deserted, wherein together we did take sweet morsels?
15. “Let there come death upon them, and let them go down unto Hell living” (ver. 15).
How hath he cited and hath made us call to mind that first beginning of schism, when in
that first people of the Jews certain proud men separated themselves, and would without
have sacrificed? A new death upon them came: the earth opened herself, and swallowed
them up alive.2040 “Let there come,” he saith, “death upon them, and let them go down into

Hell living.” What is “living”? knowing that they are perishing, and yet perishing. Hear of
living men perishing and being swallowed up in a gulf of the earth, that is, being swallowed
up in the voraciousness of earthly desires.2041 Thou sayest to a man, What aileth thee,
brother? Brethren we are, one God we invoke, in one Christ we believe, one Gospel we hear,
one Psalm we sing, one Amen we respond, one Hallelujah we sound, one Easter we celebrate:
why art thou without and I am within? Ofttimes one straitened, and perceiving how true
are the charges which are made, saith, May God requite our ancestors! Therefore alive he
perisheth. In the next place thou continuest and thus givest warning. At least let the evil of
separation stand alone, why dost thou adjoin thereto that of rebaptism? Acknowledge in
me what thou hast; and if thou hatest me, spare thou Christ in me. And this evil thing doth
frequently and very greatly displease them.…Because they themselves have the Scriptures
in their hands, and know well by daily reading how the Church Catholic through the whole
world is so spread, that in a word all contradiction is void; and that there cannot be found
any support for their schism they know well: therefore unto the lower places living they go
down, because the evil which they do, they know evil to be. But the former a fire of divine
indignation consumed. For being inflamed with desire of strife, from their evil leaders they
would not depart. There came upon fire a fire, upon the heat of dissension the heat of con-
suming. “For naughtiness is in their lodgings, in the midst of them.” “In their lodgings,”2042
wherein they tarry and pass away. For here they are not alway to be: and nevertheless in
defence of a temporal animosity they are fighting so fiercely. “In their lodgings is iniquity;
in the midst of them is iniquity:” no part of them is so near the middle of them as their heart.
16. “Therefore to the Lord I have cried out” (ver. 16). The Body of Christ and the oneness
of Christ in anguish, in weariness, in uneasiness, in the tribulation of its exercise, that One
Man, Oneness in One Body set, when He was wearying His soul in crying out from the ends
of the earth; saith, “From the ends of the earth to Thee I have cried out, when My heart was
being vexed.”2043 Himself one, but a oneness2044 that One! and Himself one, not in one
place one, but from the ends of the earth is crying as one. How from the ends of the earth
should there cry one, except there were one? “I to the Lord have cried out.” Rightly do thou
cry out to the Lord, cry not to Donatus: lest for thee he be instead of the Lord a lord, that
under the Lord would not be a fellow-servant.

thou hast received, “in evening” of things gone by, “in morning” of things to be, at “noonday”
of things ever to be. Therefore, to that which he saith “in evening” belongeth that which he
recounteth: to that which he saith, “in morning,” belongeth that which he telleth forth: to
that which he saith “at noon-day,” belongeth that wherein his voice is hearkened to. For the
end is at noon-day; that is to say, whence there is no going down unto setting. For at noon-
day there is light full high, the splendour of wisdom, the fervour of love. “In evening and in
morning and at noon-day.” “In evening,” the Lord on the Cross; “in morning,” in Resurrec-
tion; “at noon-day,” in Ascension. I will recount in evening the patience of Him dying, I
will tell forth in morning the life of Him rising, I will pray that He hearken at noon-day
sitting at the right hand of the Father. He shall hearken to my voice, That intercedeth for
us.2046 How great is the security of this man. How great the consolation, how great the
refuge “from weakness of mind and tempest,” against evil men, against ungodly men both
without and within, and in the case of those that are without though they had been within.
18. Therefore, my Brethren, those that in the very congregation of these walls ye see to
be rebellious men, proud, seeking their own, lifted up; not having a zeal for God that is
chaste, sound, quiet, but ascribing to themselves much; ready for dissension, but not finding
opportunity; are the very chaff of the Lord’s floor.2047 From hence these few men the wind
of pride hath dislodged: the whole floor will not fly, save when He at the last shall winnow.
But what shall we do, save with this man sing, with this man pray, with this man mourn
and say securely, “He shall redeem in peace my soul” (ver. 18). Against them that love not
peace: “in peace He shall redeem my soul.” “Because with those that hated peace I was peace-
making.” 2048 “He shall redeem in peace my soul, from those that draw near to me.” For
from those that are afar from me, it is an easy case: not so soon doth he deceive me that
saith, Come, pray to an idol: he is very far from me. Art thou a Christian? A Christian, he
saith. Out of a neighbouring place he is my adversary, he is at hand. “He shall redeem in
peace my soul, from those that draw near to me: for in many things they were with me.”
Wherefore have I said, “draw near to me”? Because “in many things they were with me.” In
this verse two propositions occur. “In many things they were with me.” Baptism we had
both of us, in that they were with me: the Gospel we both read, they were in that with me:
the festivals of martyrs we celebrated, they were there with me: Easter’s solemnity we atten-
ded, they were there with me. But not entirely with me: in schism not with me, in heresy
not with me. In many things with me, in few things not with me. But in these few things
wherein not with me, there is no profit to them of the many things wherein they were with
me. For see, brethren, how many things hath recounted the Apostle Paul: one thing, he hath

of angels I shall speak,” he saith, “if I have all prophecy, and all faith, and all knowledge; if
mountains I shall remove, if I shall bestow all my goods upon the poor, if I shall deliver my
body even so that it be burned.”2049 How many things he hath enumerated! To all these
many things let there be wanting one thing, charity; the former in number are more, the
latter in weight is greater. Therefore in all Sacraments they are with me, in one charity not
with me: “In many things they were with me.” Again, by a different expression: “For in many
things they were with me.” They that themselves have separated from me, with me they
were, not in few things, but in many things. For throughout the whole world few are the
grains, many are the chaffs. Therefore he saith what? In chaff with me they were, in wheat
with me they were not. And the chaff is nearly related to the wheat, from one seed it goeth
forth, in one field is rooted, with one rain is nourished, the same reaper it suffereth, the
same threshing sustaineth, the same winnowing awaiteth, but not into one barn entereth.
19. “God will hear me, and He shall humble them That is before ages” (ver. 19). For
they rely on some leader or other of theirs that hath begun but yesterday. “He shall humble
them That is before ages.” For even if with reference to time Christ is of Mary the Virgin,
nevertheless before ages: “In the beginning He is the Word and the Word with God, and
the Word God.”2050 “He shall humble them That is before ages. For to them is no changing:”
of them I “speak to whom is no changing.” He knew of some to persevere, and in the per-
severance of their own wickedness to die. For we see them, and to them is no changing: they
that die in that same perverseness, in that same schism, to them is no changing. God shall
humble them, shall humble them in damnation, because they are exalted in dissension. To
them is no changing, because they are not changed for the better, but for the worse: neither
while they are here, nor in the resurrection. For all we shall rise again, but2051 not all shall
be changed. Wherefore? Because “’To them is no changing: and they have not feared God.”…
20. “He stretcheth forth His hand in requiting” (ver. 20). “They have polluted His
Testament.” Read the testament which they have polluted: “In thy seed shall be blessed all
nations.”2052 Thou against these words of the Testator sayest what? The Africa of holy
Donatus hath alone deserved this grace, in him hath remained the Church of Christ. Say at
least the Church of Donatus. Wherefore addest thou, of Christ? Of whom it is said, “In thy
seed shall be blessed all nations.” After Donatus wilt thou go? Set aside Christ, and then se-
cede. See therefore what followeth: “They have polluted His Testament.” What Testament?
To Abraham have been spoken the promises, and to his seed. The Apostle saith, “Neverthe-

less, a man’s testament confirmed no one maketh void, or super-addeth to: to Abraham
have been spoken the promises, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as if in many;
but as if in one, And to thy Seed, which is Christ.”2053 In this Christ, therefore, what Testa-
ment hath been promised? “In thy seed shall be blessed all nations.” Thou that hast given
up the unity of all nations, and in a part hast remained, hast polluted His Testament.…
21. “And His heart hath drawn near” (ver. 22). Of whom do we understand it, except
of Him, by the anger of whom they have been divided? How “hath his heart drawn near”?
In such sort, that we may understand His will. For by heretics hath been vindicated the
Catholic Church, and by those that think evil have been proved those that think well. For
many things lay hid in the Scriptures: and when heretics had been cut off, with questions
they troubled the Church of God: then those things were opened which lay hid, and the will
of God was understood.2054 Thence is said in another Psalm, “In order that they might be
excluded that have been proved with silver.”2055 For let them be excluded, He hath said, let
them come forth, let them appear. Whence even in silver-working men are called “excluders,”
that is, pressers out of form from the sort of confusion of the lump. Therefore many men
that could understand and expound the Scriptures very excellently, were hidden among the
people of God: but they did not declare the solution of difficult questions, when no reviler
again urged them. For was the Trinity perfectly treated of before the Arians snarled thereat?
Was repentance perfectly treated of before the Novatians opposed? So not perfectly of
Baptism was it treated, before rebaptizers removed outside2056 contradicted; nor of the very
oneness of Christ were the doctrines clearly stated which have been stated, save after that
this separation began to press upon the weak: in order that they that knew how to treat of
and solve these questions (lest the weak should perish vexed with the questions of the un-
godly), by their discourses and disputations should bring out unto open day the dark things
of the Law.2057…This obscure sense see in what manner the Apostle bringeth out into light;
“It is needful,” he saith, “that also heresies there be, in order that men proved may be made
manifest among you.”2058 What is “men proved”? Proved with silver, proved with the word.
What is “may be made manifest”? May be brought out.2059 Wherefore this? Because of

heretics. So therefore these also “have been divided because of the anger of His countenance,
and His heart hath drawn near.”
22. “His discourses have been softened above oil, and themselves are darts” (ver. 21).
For certain things in the Scriptures were seeming hard, while they were obscure; when ex-
plained, they have been softened. For even the first heresy in the disciples of Christ, as it
were from the hardness of His discourse arose. For when He said, “Except a man shall have
eaten My flesh and shall have drunk My blood, he shall not have life in himself:” they, not
understanding, said to one another, “Hard is this discourse, who can hear it?” Saying that,
“Hard is this discourse,” they separated from Him: He remained with the others, the twelve.
When they had intimated to Him, that by His discourse they had been scandalized, “Will
ye also,” He saith, “choose to go?” Then Peter: “Thou hast the Word of life eternal: to whom
shall we go?”2060 Attend, we beseech you, and ye little ones learn godliness. Did Peter by
any means at that time understand the secret of that discourse of the Lord? Not yet he un-
derstood: but that good were the words which he understood not, godly he believed.
Therefore if hard is a discourse, and not yet is understood, be it hard to an ungodly man,
but to thee be it by godliness softened: for whenever it is solved, it both will become for thee
oil, and even unto the bones it will penetrate.
23. Furthermore, just as Peter, after their having been scandalized by the hardness, as
they thought, of the discourse of the Lord, even then said, “to whom shall we go?” so he
hath added, “Cast upon the Lord thy care, and He shall Himself nourish thee up” (ver. 22).
A little one thou art, not yet thou understandest the secret things of words: perchance from
thee the bread is hidden, and as yet with milk thou must be fed:2061 be not angry with the
breasts: they will make thee fit for the table, for which now little fitted thou art. Behold by
the division of heretics many hard things have been softened: His discourses that were hard
have been softened above oil, and they are themselves darts. They have armed men
preaching the Gospel: and the very discourses are aimed at the breast of every one that
heareth, by men instant in season and out of season: by those discourses, by those words,
as though by arrows, hearts of men unto the love of peace are smitten. Hard they were, and
soft they have been made. Being softened they have not lost their virtue, but into darts have
been converted.…Upon the Lord cast thyself. Behold thou wilt cast thyself upon the Lord,
let no one put himself in the place of the Lord. “Cast upon the Lord thy care.”…
24. But to the others what? “But Thou, O God, shall bring them down unto the pit of
corruption” (ver. 23). The pit of corruption is the darkness of sinking under. When blind
leadeth blind, they both fall into a ditch.2062 God bringeth them down into the pit of corrup-

Psalm LV
tion, not because He is the author of their own guilt, but because He is Himself the judge
of their iniquities. “For God hath delivered them unto the desires of their heart.”2063 For
they have loved darkness, and not light; they have loved blindness, and not seeing. For behold
the Lord Jesus hath shone out to the whole world, let them sing in unity with the whole
world: “For there is not one that can hide himself from the heat of Him.”2064 But they passing
over from the whole to a part, from the body to a wound, from life to a limb cut off, shall
meet with what, but going into the pit of corruption?
25. “Men of bloods and of deceitfulness.” Men of bloods, because of slayings he calleth
them: and O that they were corporal and not spiritual slayings. For blood from the flesh
going forth, is seen and shuddered at: who seeth the blood of the heart in a man rebaptized?
Those deaths require other eyes. Although even about these visible deaths Circumcelliones
armed everywhere remain not quiet. And if we think of these visible deaths, there are men
of bloods. Give heed to the armed man, whether he is a man of peace and not of blood. If
at least a club only he were to carry, well; but he carrieth a sling, carrieth an axe, carrieth
stones, carrieth lances; and carrying these weapons, wherever they may they scour, for the
blood of innocent men they thirst.2065 Therefore even with regard to these visible deaths
there are men of bloods. But even of them let us say, O that such deaths alone they perpet-
rated, and souls they slew not. These that are men of bloods and of deceit, let them not
suppose that we thus wrongly understand men of bloods, of them that kill souls: they
themselves of their Maximianists2066 have so understood it. For when they condemned
them, in the very sentence of their Council they have set down these words: “Swift are the
feet of them to shed the blood” (of the proclaimers2067), “tribulation and calamity are in
the ways of them, and the way of peace they have not known.”2068 This of the Maximianists
they have said. But I ask of them, when have the Maximianists shed the body’s blood; not
because they too would not shed, if there were so great a multitude as could shed, but because
of the fear in their minority rather they have suffered somewhat from others, than have
themselves at any time done any such thing. Therefore I question the Donatist and say: In
thy Council thou hast set down of the Maximianists, “Swift are the feet of them to shed
blood.” Show me one of whom the Maximianists have hurt so much as a finger! What other

thing to me is he to answer, than that which I say? They that have separated themselves
from unity,2069 and who slay souls by leading astray, spiritually, not carnally, do shed blood.
Very well thou hast expounded, but in thy exposition acknowledge their own deeds. “Men
of bloods and of deceitfulness.” In guile is deceitfulness, in dissimulation, in seduction. What
therefore of those very men that have been divided because of the anger of His countenance?
They are themselves men of bloods and of deceit.
26. But of them he saith what? “They shall not halve their days.” What is, “They shall
not halve their days”? They shall not make progress as much as they think: within the time
which they expect, they shall perish. For he is that partridge, whereof hath been said, “In
the half of his days they shall leave him, and in his last days he shall be an unwise one.”2070
They make progress, but for a time. For what saith the Apostle? “But evil men and seducers
shall make progress for the worse, themselves erring, and other men into error driving.”2071
But “a blind man leading a blind man, together into a ditch they fall.”2072 Deservedly they
fall “into the pit of corruption.” What therefore saith he? They shall make progress for the
worse: not however for long. For a little before he hath said, “But further they shall not make
progress:”2073 that is, “shall not halve their days.” Let the Apostle proceed and tell wherefore:
“For the madness of them shall be manifest to all men, as also was that of the others.” “But
I in Thee will hope, O Lord.” But deservedly they shall not halve their days, because in man
they have hoped. But I from days temporal have reached unto day eternal. Wherefore? Be-
cause in Thee I have hoped, O Lord.

Psalm LV
Psalm LVI.2074
1. Just as when we are going to enter into any house, we look on the title to see whose
it is and to whom it belongeth, lest perchance inopportunely we burst into a place whereunto
we ought not; and again, in order that we may not through timidity withdraw from that
which we ought to enter: as if in a word we were to read, These estates belong to such an
one or to such an one: so on the lintel of this Psalm we have inscribed, “At the end, for the
people that from holy men were put afar off, to David himself, at the inscription of the Title,
when the Allophyli held him in Gath.”2075 Let us therefore take knowledge of the people
that from holy men were put afar off at the inscription of the Title. For this doth belong to
that David whom now ye know how to understand spiritually. For there is here commended
to our notice no other than He of whom hath been said, “The end of the Law is Christ for
righteousness to every man believing.”2076 Therefore when thou hearest “at the end,” unto
Christ give heed, lest tarrying in the way thou arrive not at the end.…
2. Who are then the people that from holy men were put afar off at the inscription of
the Title? Let the Title itself declare to us that people. For there was written a certain title at
the Passion of the Lord, when the Lord was crucified: there was in that place a Title inscribed
in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin, “The King of the Jews;”2077 in three tongues as though
by three witnesses the Title was confirmed: because “in the mouth of two or three witnesses
shall stand every word.”2078…
3. What therefore meaneth that which to the title itself still belongeth, namely, that “the
Allophyli held him in Geth”? Geth was a certain city of the Allophyli,2079 that is, of strangers,
to wit, of people afar from holy men. All they that refuse Christ for King become strangers.
Wherefore strangers are they made? Because even that vine, though by Him planted, when
it had become sour what heard it? “Wherefore hast thou been turned into sourness, O alien
vine?”2080 It hath not been said, My vine: because if Mine, sweet; if sour, not Mine; if not
Mine, surely alien. “There held him,” then, “Allophyli in Geth.” We find indeed, brethren,
David himself, son of Jesse, king of Israel, to have been in a strange land among the Allophyli,
when he was sought by Saul, and was in that city and with the king of that city,2081 but that

Psalm LVI
there he was detained we read not. Therefore our David, the Lord Jesus Christ out of the
seed of that David, not alone they held, but there hold Him still Allophyli in Geth. Of Geth
we have said that it is a city. But the interpretation of this name, if asked for, signifieth
“press.”…How therefore here is He held in Geth? Held in a winepress is His Body, that is,
His Church. What is, in a winepress? In pressings. But in a winepress fruitful is the pressing.
A grape on the vine sustaineth no pressing, whole it seemeth, but nothing thence floweth:
it is thrown into a winepress, is trodden, is pressed; harm seemeth to be done to the grape,
but this harm is not barren; nay, if no harm had been applied, barren it would have remained.
4. Let whatsoever holy men therefore that are suffering pressing from those that have
been put afar off from the saints, give heed to this Psalm, let them perceive here themselves,
let them speak what here is spoken, that suffer what here is spoken of.…Private enmities
therefore let no one think of, when about to hear the words of this Psalm: “Know ye that
for us the wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against princes and powers, and
spiritual things of wickedness,”2082 that is, against the devil and his angels; because even
when we suffer men that annoy us, he is instigating, he is inflaming, as it were his vessels
he is moving. Let us give heed therefore to two enemies, him whom we see, and him whom
we see not; man we see, the devil we see not; man let us love, of the devil beware; for man
pray, against the devil pray, and let us say to God, “Have pity on me, O Lord, for man hath
trodden me down” (ver. 1). Fear not because man hath trodden thee down: have thou wine,
a grape thou hast become in order that thou shouldest be trodden. “All day long warring
he hath troubled me,” every one that hath been put afar off from the saints. But why should
not here be understood even the devil himself? Is it because mention is made of “man”?2083
doth therefore the Gospel err, because it hath said, “A man that is an enemy hath done
this”?2084 But by a kind of figure may he also be called a man,2085 and yet not be a man.
Whether therefore it was him whom he that said these words was beholding, or whether it
was the people and each one that was put afar off from holy men, through which kind the
devil troubleth the people of God, who cleave to holy men, who cleave to the Holy One,
who cleave to the King, at the title of which King being indignant they were as though beaten
back, and put afar off: let him say, “Have pity on me, O Lord, for man hath trodden me
down:” and let him faint not in this treading down, knowing Him on whom he is calling,
and by whose example he hath been made strong. The first cluster in the winefat pressed is
Christ. When that cluster by passion was pressed out,2086 there flowed that whence “the

Psalm LVI
cup inebriating is how passing beautiful!”2087 Let His Body likewise say, looking upon its
Head, “Have pity on me, O Lord, for man hath trodden me down: all day long warring he
hath troubled me.” “All day long,” at all times. Let no one say to himself, There have been
troubles in our fathers’ time, in our time there are not. If thou supposest thyself not to have
troubles, not yet hast thou begun to be a Christian. And where is the voice of the Apostle,
“But even all that will live godly in Christ, persecutions shall suffer.”2088 If therefore thou
sufferest not any persecution for Christ, take heed lest not yet thou hast begun godly to live
in Christ. But when thou hast begun godly to live in Christ, thou hast entered into the
winepress; make ready thyself for pressings: but be not thou dry, lest from the pressing
nothing go forth.
5. “Mine enemies have trodden me down all day long” (ver. 2). They that have been put
afar off from holy men, these are mine enemies. All day long: already it hath been said,
“From the height2089 of the day.” What meaneth, “from the height of the day”? Perchance
it is a high thing to understand. And no wonder, because the height of the day it is. For
perchance they for this reason have been put afar off from holy men, because they were not
able to penetrate the height of the day, whereof the Apostles are twelve shining hours.
Therefore they that crucified Him, as if man, in the day have erred. But why have they
suffered darkness, so that they should be put afar off from holy men? Because on high the
day was shining, Him in the height hidden they knew not. “For if they had known, never
the Lord of Glory would they have crucified.”2090…
6. “For many men that war against me, shall fear” (ver. 3). Shall fear when? When the
day shall have passed away, wherein they are high. For for a time high they are, when the
time of their height is finished they will fear. “But I in Thee will hope, O Lord.” He saith
not, “But I will not fear:” but, “Many men, that war against me, shall fear.” When there shall
have come that day of Judgment, then “shall mourn for themselves all the tribes of the
earth.”2091 When there shall have appeared the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, then secure
shall be all holy men. For that thing shall come which they hoped for, which they longed
for, the coming whereof they prayed for: but to those men no place for repentance shall re-
main, because in that time wherein fruitful might have been repentance, their heart they
hardened against a warning Lord. Shall they too raise up a wall against a judging God? The
godliness of this man do thou indeed acknowledge, and if in that Body thou art, imitate
him. When he had said, “Many men, that war against me, shall fear:” he did not continue,

Psalm LVI
“But I will not fear;” lest to his own powers ascribing his not fearing, he too should be amid
high temporal things, and through pride temporal he should not deserve to come to rest
everlasting: rather he hath made thee to perceive whence he shall not fear. “But I,” he saith,
“in thee will hope, O Lord:” he hath not spoken of his confidence: but of the cause of his
confidence. For if I shall not fear, I may also by hardness of heart not fear, for many men
by too much pride fear nothing.…
7. “In God I will praise my discourses, in God I have2092 hoped: I will not fear what
flesh doeth to me” (ver. 4). Wherefore? Because in God I will praise my discourses. If in
thyself thou praisest thy discourses: I say not that thou art not to fear; it is impossible that
thou have not to fear. For thy discourses either false thou wilt have, and therefore thine
own, because false: or if thy discourses shall be true, and thou shalt deem thyself not to have
them from God but of thyself to speak; true they will be, but thou wilt be false: but if thou
shalt have known that thou canst say nothing true in the wisdom of God, in the faith of the
Truth, save that which from Him thou hast received, of whom is said, “For what hast thou
which thou hast not received?”2093 Then in God thou art praising thy discourses, in order
that in God thou mayest be praised by the discourses of God.…“In God I have hoped, I will
not fear what flesh doeth to me.” Wast thou not the same that a little before wast saying,
“Have pity on me, O Lord, for man hath trodden me down; all day long warring he hath
troubled me”?2094 How therefore here, “I will not fear what flesh doeth to me”? What shall
he do to thee? Thou thyself a little before hast said, “Hath trodden me down, hath troubled
me.” Nothing shall he do, when these things he shall do? He hath had regard to the wine
which floweth from treading, and hath made answer, Evidently he hath trodden down,
evidently hath troubled; but what to me shall he do? A grape I was, wine I shall be: “In God
I have hoped, I will not fear what flesh doeth to me.”
8. “All day long my words they abhorred” (ver. 5). Thus they are, ye know. Speak truth,
preach truth, proclaim Christ to the heathen, proclaim the Church to heretics, proclaim to
all men salvation: they contradict, they abhor my words. But when my words they abhor,
whom think ye they abhor, save Him in whom I shall praise my discourses? “All day long
my words they abhorred.” Let this at least suffice, let them abhor words, no farther let them
proceed, censure, reject! Be it far from them! Why should I say this? When words they reject,
when words they hate, those words which from the fount of truth flow forth, what would
they do to him through whom the very words are spoken? what but that which followeth,
“Against me all the counsels of them are for evil?” If the bread itself they hate, how spare
they the basket wherein it is ministered? “Against me all the counsels of them are for evil.”
2092 Or, “will hope,” mss.

2094 Ps. lvi. 1.
Psalm LVI
If so even against the Lord Himself, let not the Body disdain that which hath gone before
in the Head, to the end that the Body may cleave to the Head. Despised hath been thy Lord,
and wilt thou have thyself be honoured by those men that have been put afar off from holy
men? Do not for thyself wish to claim that which in Him hath not gone before. “The disciple
is not greater than his Master; the servant is not greater than his Lord. If the Master of the
family they have called Beelzebub, how much more them of His household?”2095 Against
me all the counsels of them are for evil.”
9. “They shall sojourn, and shall hide” (ver. 6). To sojourn is to be in a strange land.
Sojourners is a term used of those then that live in a country not their own. Every man in
this life is a foreigner: in which life ye see that with flesh we are covered round, through
which flesh the heart cannot be seen. Therefore the Apostle saith, “Do not before the time
judge anything, until the Lord come, and He shall enlighten the hidden things of darkness,
and shall manifest the thoughts of the heart; and then praise shall be to each one from
God.”2096 Before that this be done, in this sojourning of fleshly life every one carrieth his
own heart, and every heart to every other heart is shut. Furthermore, those men of whom
the counsels are against this man for evil, “shall sojourn, and shall hide:” because in this
foreign abode they are, and carry flesh, they hide guile in heart; whatsoever of evil they think,
they hide. Wherefore? Because as yet this life is a foreign one. Let them hide; that shall appear
which they hide, and they too will not be hidden. There is also in this hidden thing another
interpretation, which perchance will be more approved of. For out of those men that have
been put afar off from holy men, there creep in certain false brethren, and they cause worse
tribulations to the Body of Christ; because they are not altogether avoided as if entirely ali-
ens.…Not even those men nevertheless let us fear, brethren: “I will not fear what flesh doeth
to me.” Even if they sojourn, even if they go in, even if they feign, even if they hide, flesh
they are: do thou in the Lord hope, nothing to thee shall flesh do. But he bringeth in tribu-
lation, bringeth in treading down. There is added wine, because the grape is pressed: thy
tribulation will not be unfruitful: another seeth thee, imitateth thee: because thou also in
order that thou mightest learn to bear such a man, to thy Head hast looked up, that first
cluster, unto whom there hath come in a man that he might see, hath sojourned, and hath
hidden, to wit, the traitor Judas. All men, therefore, that with false heart go in, sojourning
and hiding, do not thou fear: the father of these same men, Judas, with thy Lord hath been:
and He indeed knew him; although Judas the traitor was sojourning and hiding, nevertheless,
the heart of him was open to the Lord of all:2097 knowingly He chose one man, whereby He
might give comfort to thee that wouldest not know whom thou shouldest avoid. For He
2095 Matt. x. 24, 25.

2097 Oxf. mss. “guilty before the Lord.”
Psalm LVI
might have not chosen Judas, because He knew Judas: for He saith to His disciples, “Have
not I chosen you twelve, and one out of you is a devil?”2098 Therefore even a devil was
chosen. Or if chosen he was not, how is it that He hath chosen twelve, and not rather eleven?
Chosen even he is, but for another purpose. Chosen were eleven for the work of probation,
chosen one for the work of temptation.2099 Whence could He give an example to thee, that
wouldest not know what men thou shouldest avoid as evil, of what men thou shouldest be-
ware as false and artificial, sojourning and hiding, except He say to thee, Behold, with Myself
I have had one of those very men! There hath gone before an example, I have borne, to
suffer I have willed that which I knew, in order that to thee knowing not I might give con-
solation. That which to Me he hath done, the same he will do to thee also: in order that he
may be able to do much, in order that he may make much havoc, he will accuse, false charges
he will allege.…
10. “These same men shall mark my heel.” For they shall sojourn and hide in such sort,
that they may mark where a man slippeth. Intent they are upon the heel, to see when a slip
may chance to be made; in order that they may detain the foot for a fall, or trip up the foot
for a stumble; certes that they may find that which they may accuse. And what man so
walketh, that nowhere he slippeth? For example, how speedily is a slip made even in tongue?
For it is written, “Whosoever in tongue stumbleth not, the same is a perfect man.”2100 What
man I pray would dare himself to call or deem perfect? Therefore it must needs be that every
one slip in tongue. But let them that shall sojourn and shall hide, carp at all words, seeking
somewhere to make snares and knotty false accusations, wherein they are themselves en-
tangled before those whom they strive to entangle: in order that they may themselves be
taken and perish before that they catch other men in order to destroy them.…Whatever
good thing I have said, whatever true thing I have said, of God I have said it, and from God
have said it: whatever other thing perchance I have said, which to have said I ought not, as
a man I have said, but under God I have said. He that strengtheneth one walking, doth
menace one straying, forgive one acknowledging, recalleth the tongue, recalleth him that
slipped.…Attend thou unto the discourses of him whom thou blamest, whether perchance
he may teach thee something to thy health. And what, he saith, shall he be able to teach to
my health, that hath so slipped in word? This very thing perchance he is teaching thee to
thy health, that thou be not a carper at words, but a gatherer of precepts. “As my soul hath
undergone.” I speak of that which I have undergone. He was speaking as one experienced:
“As my soul hath undergone. They shall sojourn and hide.” Let my soul undergo all men,

Psalm LVI
men without barking, men within hiding, let it undergo. From without coming, like a river
cometh temptation: on the Rock let it find thee, let it strike against, not throw thee down;
the house hath been founded upon a Rock.2101 Within he is, he shall sojourn and hide:
suppose chaff is near thee, let there come in the treading of oxen, let there come in the roller
of temptations; thou art cleansed, the other is crushed.
11. “For nothing Thou shalt save them” (ver. 7). He hath taught us even for these very
men to pray. However “they shall sojourn and hide,” however deceitful they be, however
dissemblers and liers in wait they be; do thou pray for them, and do not say, Shall God
amend even such a man, so evil, so perverse? Do not despair: give heed to Him whom thou
askest, not him for whom thou askest. The greatness of the disease seest thou, the might of
the Physician seest thou not? “They shall sojourn and hide: as my soul hath undergone.”
Undergo, pray: and there is done what? “For nothing Thou shalt save them.” Thou shalt
make them safe so as that nothing to Thee it may be, that is, so that no labour to Thee it
may be. With men they are despaired of, but Thou with a word dost heal; Thou wilt not toil
in healing, though we are astounded in looking on. There is another sense in this verse, “For
nothing Thou shalt save them:” with not any merits of their going before Thou shalt save
them.…They shall not bring to Thee he-goats, rams, bulls, not gifts and spices shall they
bring Thee in Thy temple, not anything of the drink-offering of a good conscience do they
pour thereon; all in them is rough, all foul, all to be detested: and though they to Thee bring
nothing whereby they may be saved; “For nothing Thou shalt save them,” that is, with the
free gift of Thy Grace.…
12. “In anger the peoples Thou shalt bring down.” Thou art angry and dost bring down,
dost rage and save, dost terrify and call. Thou fillest with tribulations all things, in order
that being set in tribulations men may fly to Thee, lest by pleasures and a wrong security
they be seduced. From Thee anger is seen, but that of a father. A father is angry with a son,
the despiser of his injunctions: being angry with him he boxeth him, striketh, pulleth the
ear, draggeth with hand, leadeth to school. How many men have entered, how many men
have filled the House of the Lord, in the anger of Him brought down, that is, by tribulations
terrified and with faith filled? For to this end tribulation stirreth up; in order to empty the
vessel which is full of wickedness, so as that it may be filled with grace.
13. “O God, my life I have told out to Thee” (ver. 8). For that I live hath been Thy doing,
and for this reason I tell out my life to Thee. But did not God know that which He had given?
What is that which thou tellest out to Him? Wilt thou teach God? Far be it. Therefore why
saith he, “I have told out to Thee”? Is it perchance because it profiteth Thee that I have told
out my life? And what doth it profit God? To the advantage of God it doth profit. I have
told out to God my life, because that life hath been God’s doing. In like manner as his life
2101 Matt. vii. 25.
Psalm LVI
Paul the Apostle did tell out, saying, “I that before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and
injurious,” he shall tell out his life. “But mercy I have obtained.”2102 He hath told out his
life, not for himself, but for Him: because he hath told it out in such sort, that in Him men
believe, not for his own advantages, but for the advantages of Him.…“O God, my life I have
told out to Thee. Thou hast put my tears in Thy sight.” Thou hast hearkened to me imploring
Thee. “As also in Thy promise.” Because as Thou hadst promised this thing, so Thou hast
done. Thou hast said Thou wouldest hearken to one weeping. I have believed, I have wept,
I have been hearkened unto; I have found Thee merciful in promising, true in repaying.
14. “Turned be mine enemies backward” (ver. 9). This thing to these very men is prof-
itable, no ill to these men he is wishing. For to go before they are willing, therefore to be
amended they are not willing. Thou warnest thine enemy to live well, that he amend himself:
he scorneth, he rejecteth thy word: “Behold him that adviseth me; behold him from whom
I am to hear the commandments whereby I shall live!” To go before thee he willeth, and in
going before is not amended. He mindeth not that thy words are not thine, he mindeth not
that thy life to God thou tellest out, not to thyself. In going before therefore he is not
amended: it is a good thing for him that he be turned backward, and follow him whom to
go before he willed. The Lord to His disciples was speaking of His Passion that was to be.
Peter shuddered, and saith, “Far be it, O Lord;”2103 he that a little before had said, “Thou
art the Christ, Son of the living God,” having confessed God, feared for Him to die, as if but
a man. But the Lord who so came that He might suffer (for we could not otherwise be saved
unless with His blood we were redeemed), a little before had praised the confession of
Peter.…But immediately when the Lord beginneth to speak of His Passion, he feared lest
He should perish by death, whereas we ourselves should perish unless He died; and he saith,
“Far be it, O Lord, this thing shall not be done.” And the Lord, to him to whom a little before
He had said, “Blessed thou art, and upon this Rock I will build my Church,” saith, “Go back
behind, Satan, an offence thou art to Me.” Why therefore “Satan” is he, that a little before
was “blessed,” and a “Rock”? “For thou savourest not the things which are of God,” He saith,
“but those things which are of man.” 2104 A little before he savoured the things which are
of God: because “not flesh and blood hath revealed to thee, but My Father which is in the
Heavens.” When in God he was praising his discourse, not Satan but Peter, from petra: but
when of himself and out of human infirmity, carnal love of man, which would be for an
impediment to his own salvation, and that of the rest, Satan he is called. Why? Because to
go before the Lord he willed, and earthly counsel to give to the heavenly Leader. “Far be it,
O Lord, this thing shall not be done.” Thou sayest, “Far be it,” and thou sayest, “O Lord:”

Psalm LVI
surely if Lord He is, in power He doeth: if Master He is, He knoweth what He doeth, He
knoweth what He teacheth. But thou willest to lead thy Leader, teach thy Master, command
thy Lord, choose for God: much thou goest before, go back behind. Did not this too profit
these enemies? “Turned be Mine enemies backward;” but let them not remain backward.
For this reason let them be turned backward, lest they go before; but so that they follow, not
so that they remain.
15. “In whatsoever day I shall have called upon Thee, behold I have known that my God
art Thou” (ver. 9). A great knowledge. He saith not, “I have known that God Thou art:” but,
“that my God art Thou.” For thine He is, when thee He succoureth: thine He is, when thou
to Him art not an alien. Whence is said, “Blessed the people of whom is the Lord the God
of the same.” 2105 Wherefore “of whom is”? For of whom is He not? Of all things indeed
God He is: but of those men the God peculiarly He is said to be, that love Him, that hold
Him, that possess Him, that worship Him, as though belonging to His own House: the great
family of Him are they, redeemed by the great blood of the Only Son. How great a thing
hath God given to us, that His own we should be, and He should be ours! But in truth for-
eigners afar have been put from holy men, sons alien they are. See what of them is said in
another Psalm: “O Lord, deliver me,” he saith, “from the hand of alien sons, of whom the
mouth hath spoken vanity, and the right hand of them is a right hand of iniquity.”2106…
16. Let us therefore love God, brethren, purely and chastely. There is not a chaste heart,
if God for reward it worshippeth. How so? Reward of the worship of God shall not we have?
We shall have evidently, but it is God Himself whom we worship. Himself for us a reward
shall be, because “we shall see Him as He is.”2107 Observe that a reward2108 thou shalt ob-
tain.…I will tell you, brethren: in these human alliances consider a chaste heart, of what
sort it is towards God: certainly human alliances are of such sort, that a man doth not love
his wife, that loveth her because of her portion: a woman her husband doth not chastely
love, that for these reasons loveth him, because something he hath given, or because much
he hath given. Both a rich man is a husband, and one that hath become a poor man is a
husband. How many men proscribed, by chaste wives have been the more beloved! Proved
have been many chaste marriages by the misfortunes of husbands: that the wives might not
be supposed to love any other object more than their husband, not only have they not for-
saken, but the more have they obeyed. If therefore a husband of flesh freely is loved, if
chastely he is loved; and a wife of flesh freely is loved, if chastely she is loved; in what manner
must God be loved, the true and truth-speaking Husband of the soul, making fruitful unto

Psalm LVI
the offspring of everlasting life, and not suffering us to be barren? Him, therefore, so let us
love, as that any other thing besides Himself be not loved: and there takes place in us that
which we have spoken of, that which we have sung, because even here the voice is ours: “In
whatsoever day I shall have called upon Thee, behold, I have known that my God art Thou.”
This is to call upon God, freely to call upon Him. Furthermore, of certain men hath been
said what? “Upon the Lord they have not called.”2109 The Lord they seemed as it were to
call unto themselves and they besought Him about inheritances, about increasing money,
about lengthening this life, about the rest of temporal things: and concerning them the
Scripture saith what? “Upon the Lord they have not called.” Therefore there followeth what?
“There they have feared with fear, where there was no fear.” What is, “where there was no
fear”? Lest money should be stolen from them, lest anything in their house should be made
less; lastly, lest they should have less of years in this life, than they hoped for themselves:
but there have they trembled with fear, where there was no fear.…“In God I will praise the
word, in the Lord I will praise the discourse” (ver. 10): “in God I have hoped, I will not fear
what man doeth unto me” (ver. 11). Now this is the very sense which above2110 hath been
repeated.
17. “In me, O God, are Thy vows, which I will render of praise to Thee” (ver. 12). “Vow
ye, and render to the Lord your God.”2111 What vow, what render? Perchance those animals
which were offered at the altars aforetime? No such thing offer thou: in thyself is what thou
mayest vow and render. From the heart’s coffer bring forth the incense of praise; from the
store of a good conscience bring forth the sacrifice of faith. Whatsoever thing thou bringest
forth, kindle with love. In thyself be the vows, which thou mayest render of praise to God.
Of what praise? For what hath He granted thee? “For Thou hast rescued my soul from death”
(ver. 13). This is that very life which he telleth out to Him: “O God, my life I have told out
to Thee.”2112 For I was what? Dead. Through myself I was dead: through Thee I am what?
Alive. Therefore “in me, O God, are Thy vows, which I will render of praise to Thee.” Behold
I love my God: no one doth tear Him from me: that which to Him I may give, no one doth
tear from me, because in the heart it is shut up. With reason is said with that former confid-
ence, “What should man do unto me?”2113 Let man rage, let him be permitted to rage, be
permitted to accomplish that which he attempteth: what is he to take away? Gold, silver,
cattle, men servants, maid servants, estates, houses, let him take away all things: doth he by
any means take away the vows, which are in me, which I may render of praise to God? The

Psalm LVI
tempter was permitted to tempt a holy man, Job;2114 in one moment he took away all things:
whatever of possessions he had had, he carried off: took away inheritance, slew heirs; and
this not little by little, but in a crowd, at one blow, at one swoop, so that all things were on
a sudden announced: when all was taken away, alone there remained Job, but in him were
vows of praise, which he might render to God, in him evidently there were: the coffer of his
holy breast the thieving devil had not rifled, full he was of that wherefrom he might sacrifice.
Hear what he had, hear what he brought forth: “The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken
away; as hath pleased the Lord, so hath been done: be the name of the Lord blessed.”2115 O
riches interior, whither thief doth not draw near! God Himself had given that whereof He
was receiving; He had Himself enriched him with that whereof to Him he was offering that
which He loved. Praise from thee God requireth, thy confession God requireth. But from
thy field wilt thou give anything? He hath Himself rained in order that thou mayest have.
From thy coffer wilt thou give anything? He hath Himself put in that which thou art to give.
What wilt thou give, which from Him thou hast not received? “For what hast thou which
thou hast not received?”2116 From the heart wilt thou give? He too hath given faith, hope,
and charity: this thou must bring forth: this thou must sacrifice. But evidently all the other
things the enemy is able to take away against thy will; this to take away he is not able, unless
thou be willing. These things a man will lose even against his will: and wishing to have gold,
will lose gold; and wishing to have house, will lose house: faith no one will lose, except him
that shall have despised her.
18. “Because Thou hast rescued my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet
from slipping: that I may be pleasing before God in the light of the living” (ver. 13). With
reason he is not pleasing to alien sons, that are put afar off from holy men, because they
have not the light of the living, whence they may see that which to God is pleasing. “Light
of the living,” is light of the immortal, light of holy men. He that is not in darkness, is
pleasing in the light of the living. A man is observed, and the things which belong to him;
no one knoweth of what sort he is: God seeth of what sort he is. Sometimes even the devil
himself he escapeth; except he tempt, he findeth not: just as concerning that man of whom
just now I have made mention:…“Doth Job by any means worship God for nought?”2117
For this was true light, this the light of the living, that gratis he should worship God. God
saw in the heart of His servant His gratuitous worship. For that heart was pleasing in the
sight of the Lord in the light of the living: the devil’s sight he escaped, because in darkness
he was. God admitted the tempter, not in order that He might Himself know that which He
2114 Job i. 12.
2115 Job i. 21.
2116 1 Cor. iv. 7.
2117 Job i. 9.
Psalm LVI
did know, but in order that to us to be known and imitated He might set it forth. Admitted
was the tempter; he took away everything, there remained the man bereft of possessions,
bereft of family, bereft of children, full of God. A wife certainly was left.2118 Merciful do ye
deem the devil, that he left him a wife? He knew through whom he had deceived
Adam.…With wound smitten from head even unto feet, whole nevertheless within, he made
answer to the woman tempting, out of the light of the living, out of the light of his heart:
“thou hast spoken as though one of the unwise women,”2119 that is, as though one that hath
not the light of the living. For the light of the living is wisdom, and the darkness of unwise
men is folly. Thou hast spoken as though one of the unwise women: my flesh thou seest,
the light of my heart thou seest not. For she then might more have loved her husband, if
the interior beauty she had known, and had beheld the place where he was beautiful before
the eyes of God: because in Him were vows which he might render of praise to God. How
entirely the enemy had forborne to invade that patrimony! How whole was that which he
was possessing, and that because of which yet more to be possessed he hoped for, being to
go on “from virtues unto virtue.”2120 Therefore, brethren, to this end let all these things
serve us, that God gratis we love, in Him hope always, neither man nor devil fear. Neither
the one nor the other doeth anything, except when it is permitted: permitted for no other
reason can it be, except because it doth profit us. Let us endure evil men, let us be good men:
because even we have been evil. Even as nothing2121 God shall save men, of whom we dare
to despair. Therefore of no one let us despair, for all men whom we suffer let us pray, from
God let us never depart. Our patrimony let Him be, our hope let Him be, our safety let Him
be. He is Himself here a comforter, there a remunerator, everywhere Maker-alive, and of
life the Giver, not of another life, but of that whereof hath been said, “I am the Way, and
the Truth, and the Life:”2122 in order that both here in the light of faith, and there in the
light of sight, as it were in the light of the living, in the sight of the Lord we may be pleasing.

Psalm LVII.2123
1. We have heard in the Gospel just now, brethren, how loveth us our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, God with the Father, Man with us, out of our own selves, now at2124 the right
hand of the Father; ye have heard how much He loveth us.…
2. Because then this Psalm is singing of the Passion of the Lord, see what is the title that
it hath: “at the end.” The end is Christ.2125 Why hath He been called end? Not as one that
consumeth, but one that consummateth.…
3. “At the end, corrupt not, for David himself, for the inscription of the title; when he
fled from the face of Saul into a cavern.” We referring to holy Scripture, do find indeed how
holy David, that king of Israel, from whom too the Psalter of David hath received the name
thereof, had suffered for persecutor Saul the king of his own people, as many of you know
that have either read or have heard the Scriptures. King David had then for persecutor Saul:
and whereas the one was most gentle, the other most ferocious: the one mild, the other en-
vious; the one patient, the other cruel; the one beneficent, the other ungrateful: he endured
him with so much mildness, that when he had gotten him into his hands him he touched
not, hurt not.2126…What reference hath this to Christ? If all things which then were being
done, were figures of things future, we find there Christ, and by far in the greatest degree.
For this, “corrupt not for the inscription of the title,” I see not how it belongeth to that
David. For not any “title” was inscribed over David himself which Saul would “corrupt.”
But we see in the Passion of the Lord that there had been written a title, “King of the Jews:”
2127 in order that this title might put to the blush these very men, seeing that from their
King they withheld not their hands. For in them Saul was, in Christ David was. For Christ,
as saith the Apostolic Gospel, is, as we know, as we confess, of the seed of David after the
flesh;2128 for after the Godhead He is above David, above all men, above heaven and earth,
above angels, above all things visible and invisible.…And because already it had been sung
through the Holy Spirit, “Unto the end, corrupt not, for the inscription of the title:” Pilate
answered them, “What I have written, I have written:”2129 why do ye suggest to me falsehood?
I corrupt not truth.
4. What therefore is, “When he fled from the face of Saul into a cavern”? Which thing
indeed the former David also did: but because in him we find not the inscription of the title,

in the latter let us find the flight into the cavern.2130 For that cavern wherein David hid
himself did figure somewhat. But wherefore hid he himself? It was in order that he might
be concealed and not be found. What is to be hidden in a cavern? To be hidden in earth.
For he that fleeth into a cavern, with earth is covered so that he may not be seen. But Jesus
did carry earth, flesh which He had received from earth: and in it He concealed Himself, in
order that by Jews He might not be discovered as God. “For if they had known, never the
Lord of glory would they have crucified.”2131 Why therefore the Lord of glory found they
not? Because in a cavern He had hidden Himself, that is, the flesh’s weakness to their eyes
He presented, but the Majesty of the Godhead in the body’s clothing, as though in a hiding-
place of the earth, He hid.…But wherefore even unto death willed He to be patient? It was
in order that He might flee from the face of Saul into a cavern. For a cavern may be under-
stood as a lower part of the earth. And certainly, as is manifest and certain to all, His Body
in a Tomb was laid, which was cut in a Rock. This Tomb therefore was the Cavern; thither
He fled from the face of Saul. For so long the Jews did persecute Him, even until He was
laid in a cavern. Whence prove we that so long they persecuted Him, until therein He was
laid? Even when dead, and, on the Cross hanging, with lance they wounded Him.2132 But
when shrouded, the funeral celebrated, He was laid in a cavern, no longer had they anything
which to the Flesh they might do. Rose therefore the Lord again out of that cavern unhurt,
uncorrupt, from that place whither He had fled from the face of Saul: concealing Himself
from ungodly men, whom Saul prefigured, but showing Himself to His members. For the
members of Him rising again by His members were handled: for the members of Him, the
Apostles, touched Him rising again and believed;2133 and behold nothing profited the per-
secution of Saul. Hear we therefore now the Psalm; because concerning the title thereof
enough we have spoken, as far as the Lord hath deigned to give.
5. “Have pity on me, O God, have pity on me, for in Thee hath trusted my Soul” (ver.
1). Christ in the Passion saith, “Have pity on Me, O God.” To God, God saith, “Have pity
on Me!” He that with the Father hath pity on thee, in thee crieth, “Have pity on Me.” For
that part of Him which is crying, “Have pity on Me,” is thine: from thee this He received,
for the sake of thee, that thou shouldest be delivered, with Flesh He was clothed. The flesh
itself crieth: “Have pity on Me, O God, have pity on me:” Man himself, soul and flesh. For
whole Man did the Word take upon Him, and whole Man the Word became. Let it not
therefore be thought that there Soul was not, because the Evangelist thus saith: “The Word
was made flesh, and dwelled in us.”2134 For man is called flesh, as in another place saith the

Psalm LVII
Scripture, “And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”2135 Shall anywise flesh alone see,
and shall Soul not be there?…Thou hearest the Master praying, learn thou to pray. For to
this end He prayed, in order that He might teach how to pray: because to this end He suffered,
in order that He might teach how to suffer; to this end He rose again, in order that He might
teach how to hope for rising again. “And in the shadow of Thy wings I will hope, until
iniquity pass over.” This now evidently whole Christ doth say: here is also our voice. For
not yet hath passed over, still rife is iniquity. And in the end our Lord Himself said there
should be an abounding of iniquity: “And since iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall
wax cold; but he that shall have persevered unto the end, the same shall be saved.”2136 But
who shall persevere even unto the end, even until iniquity pass over? He that shall have been
in the Body of Christ, he that shall have been in the members of Christ, and from the Head
shall have learned the patience of persevering. Thou passest away, and behold passed are
thy temptations; and thou goest into another life whither have gone holy men, if holy thou
hast been. Into another life have gone Martyrs; if Martyr thou shalt have been, thou also
goest into another life. Because “thou” hast passed away hence, hath by any means iniquity
therefore passed away? There are born other unrighteous men, as there die some unrighteous
men. In like manner therefore as some unrighteous men die and others are born: so some
just men go, and others are born. Even unto the end of the world neither iniquity will be
wanting to oppress, nor righteousness to suffer.…
6. “I will cry to God most high” (ver. 2). If most high He is, how heareth He thee crying?
Confidence hath been engendered by experience: “to God,” he saith, “who had done good
to me.” If before that I was seeking Him, He did good to me, when I cry shall He not hearken
to me? For good to us the Lord God hath done in sending to us our Saviour Jesus Christ,
that He might die for our offences, and rise again for our justification.2137 For what sort of
men hath He willed His Son to die? For ungodly men. But ungodly men were not seeking
God, and have been sought of God. For He is Most High in such sort, as that not far from
Him is our misery and our groaning: because “near is the Lord to them that have bruised
the heart.”2138 “God that hath done good to me.”
7. “He hath sent from heaven and hath saved me” (ver. 3). Now the Man Himself, now
the Flesh Itself, now the Son of God after His partaking of ourselves, of Him it is manifest,
how He was saved, and hath sent from heaven the Father and hath saved Him, hath sent
from heaven, and hath raised Him again: but in order that ye may know, that also the Lord
Himself hath raised again Himself; both truths are written in Scripture, both that the Father
2135 Isa. xl. 5, lii. 10; Luke iii. 6.
2136 Matt. xxiv. 12.
2137 Rom. iv. 25.
2138 Ps. xxxiv. 18.
Psalm LVII
hath raised Him again, and that Himself Himself hath raised again. Hear ye how the Father
hath raised Him again: the Apostle saith, “He hath been made,” he saith, “obedient unto
death, even the death of the Cross: wherefore God also hath exalted Him, and hath given
Him a name which is above every name.”2139 Ye have heard of the Father raising again and
exalting the Son; hear ye how that He too Himself His flesh hath raised again. Under the
figure of a temple He saith to the Jews, “Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise
it up.”2140 But the Evangelist hath explained to us what it was that He said: “But this,” he
saith, “He spake of the Temple of His Body.” Now therefore out of the person of one praying,
out of the person of a man, out of the person of the flesh, He saith, “He hath saved me. He
hath given unto reproach those that trampled on me.” Them that have trampled on Him,
that over Him dead have insulted, that Him as though man have crucified, because God
they perceived not, them He hath given unto reproach. See ye whether it has not been so
done. The thing we do not believe as yet to come, but fulfilled we acknowledge it. The Jews
raged against Christ, they were overbearing against Christ. Where? In the city of Jerusalem.
For where they reigned, there they were puffed up, there their necks they lifted up. After
the Passion of the Lord thence they were rooted out; and they lost the kingdom, wherein
Christ for King they would not acknowledge. In what manner they have been given unto
reproach, see ye: dispersed they have been throughout all nations, nowhere having a settle-
ment, nowhere a sure abode. But for this reason still Jews they are, in order that our books
they may carry to their confusion. For whenever we wish to show Christ prophesied of, we
produce to the heathen these writings. And lest perchance men hard of belief should say
that we Christians have composed these books, so that together with the Gospel which we
have preached we have forged the Prophet, through whom there might seem to be foretold
that which we preach: by this we convince them; namely, that all the very writings wherein
Christ hath been prophesied are with the Jews, all these very writings the Jews have. We
produce documents from enemies, to confound other enemies. In what sort of reproach
therefore are the Jews? A document the Jew carrieth, wherefrom a Christian may believe.
Our librarians they have become, just as slaves are wont behind their masters to carry doc-
uments, in such sort that these faint in carrying, those profit by reading.2141 Unto such a
reproach have been given the Jews: and there hath been fulfilled that which so long before
hath been foretold, “He hath given unto reproach those that trampled on me.” But how
great a reproach it is, brethren, that this verse they should read, and themselves being blind
should look upon their mirror! For in the same manner the Jews appear in the holy Scripture
2139 Phil. ii. 8, 9.
2140 John ii. 19.
2141 [See p. 132, note 3, supra.—C.]
Psalm LVII
which they carry, as appeareth the face of a blind man in a mirror: by other men it is seen,
by himself not seen.
8. Thou wast inquiring perhaps when he said, “He hath sent from heaven and hath saved
me.” What hath He sent from heaven? Whom hath He sent from heaven? An Angel hath
He sent, to save Christ, and through a servant is the Lord saved? For all Angels are
creatures2142 serving Christ. For obedience there might have been sent Angels, for service
they might have been sent, not for succour: as is written, “Angels ministered unto Him,”2143
not like men merciful to one indigent, but like subjects to One Omnipotent. What therefore
“hath He sent from heaven, and hath saved me”? Now we hear in another verse what from
heaven He hath sent. “He hath sent from heaven His mercy and His truth.”2144 For what
purpose? “And hath drawn out my soul from the midst of the lions’ whelps.”2145 “Hath
sent,” he saith, “from heaven His mercy and His truth:” and Christ Himself saith, “I am
Truth.” There was sent therefore Truth, that it should draw out my soul hence from the
midst of the lions’ whelps: there was sent mercy. Christ Himself we find to be both mercy
and truth; mercy in suffering with us, and truth in requiting us.…Who are the lions’ whelps?
That lesser2146 people, unto evil deceived, unto evil led away by the chiefs of the Jews: so
that these are lions, those lions’ whelps. All roared, all slew. For we are to hear even here
the slaying of these very men, presently in the following verses of this Psalm.
9. “And hath drawn out,” he saith, “my soul from the midst of the lions’ whelps” (ver.
4). Why sayest thou, “And hath drawn out my soul”? For what hadst thou suffered, that thy
soul should be drawn out? “I have slept troubled.” Christ hath intimated His death.…
10. Whence “troubled”? Who troubling? Let us see in what manner he brandeth an evil
conscience upon the Jews, wishing to excuse themselves of the slaying of the Lord. For to
this end, as the Gospel speaketh, to the judge they delivered Him, that they might not
themselves seem to have killed Him.…Let us question Him, and say, since Thou hast slept
troubled, who have persecuted Thee? who have slain Thee? was it perchance Pilate, who to
soldiers gave Thee, on the Tree to be hanged, with nails to be pierced? Hear who they were,
“Sons of men” (ver. 5). Of them He speaketh, whom for persecutors He suffered. But how
did they slay, that steel bare not? They that sword drew not, that made no assault upon Him
to slay; whence slew they? “Their teeth are arms and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.”
Do not consider the unarmed hands, but the mouth armed: from thence the sword proceeded,
wherewith Christ was to be slain: in like manner also as from the mouth of Christ, that
2142 Lat. “a creature.”
2143 Matt. iv. 11.
2144 Ps. lvii. 3.
2145 Ps. lvii. 4.
2146 Minutus.
Psalm LVII
wherewith the Jews were to be slain. For He hath a sword twice whetted:2147 and rising
again He hath smitten them, and hath severed from them those whom He would make His
faithful people. They an evil sword, He a good sword: they evil arrows, He good arrows. For
He hath Himself also arrows good, words good, whence He pierceth the faithful heart, in
order that He may be loved. Therefore of one kind are their arrows, and of another kind
their sword. “Sons of men, their teeth are arms and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sabre.”
Tongue of sons of men is a sharp sabre, and their teeth arms and arrows. When therefore
did they smite, save when they clamoured, “Crucify, crucify”?2148
11. And what have they done to Thee, O Lord? Let the Prophet here exult! For above,
all those verses the Lord was speaking: a Prophet indeed, but in the person of the Lord, be-
cause in the Prophet is the Lord.…“Be exalted,” he saith, “above the Heavens, O God.” Man
on the Cross, and above the Heavens, God. Let them continue on the earth raging, Thou in
Heaven be judging. Where are they that were raging? where are their teeth, the arms and
arrows? Have not “the stripes of them been made the arrows of infants”? For in another
place a Psalm2149 this saith, desiring to prove them vainly to have raged, and vainly unto
frenzies to have been driven headlong: for nothing they were able to do to Christ when for
the time crucified, and afterwards when He was rising again, and in Heaven was sitting.
How do infants make to themselves arrows? Of reeds?2150 But what arrows? or what powers?
or what bows? or what wound? “Be Thou exalted above the Heavens, O God, and above all
the earth Thy glory” (ver. 6). Wherefore exalted above the Heavens, O God? Brethren, God
exalted above the Heavens we see not, but we believe: but above all the earth His glory to
be not only we believe, but also see. But what kind of madness heretics are afflicted with, I
pray you observe. They being cut off from the bond of the Church of Christ, and to a part
holding, the whole losing, will not communicate with the whole earth, where is spread
abroad the glory of Christ.2151 But we Catholics are in all the earth, because with all the
world we communicate, wherever the Glory of Christ is spread abroad.2152 For we see that
which then was sung, now fulfilled. There hath been exalted above the Heavens our God,
and above all the earth the Glory of the Same. O heretical insanity! That which thou seest
not thou believest with me, that which thou seest thou deniest: thou believest with me in

Psalm LVII
Christ exalted above the Heavens, a thing which we see not; and deniest His Glory over all
the earth, a thing which we see.
12. …Let your Love see the Lord speaking to us, and exhorting us by His example: “A
trap2153 they have prepared for My feet, and have bowed down My Soul” (ver. 7). They
wished to bring It down as if from Heaven, and to the lower places to weigh It down: “They
have bowed My Soul: they have digged before My face a pit and themselves have fallen into
it.” Me have they hurt, or themselves? Behold He hath been exalted above the Heavens, God,
and behold above all the earth the Glory of the Same: the kingdom of Christ we see, where
is the kingdom of the Jews? Since therefore they did that which to have done they ought
not, there hath been done in their case that which to have suffered they ought: themselves
have dug a ditch, and themselves have fallen into it. For their persecuting Christ, to Christ
did no hurt, but to themselves did hurt. And do not suppose, brethren, that themselves alone
hath this befallen. Every one that prepareth a pit for his brother, it must needs be that himself
fall into it.…
13. But the patience of good men with preparation of heart accepteth the will of God:
and glorieth in tribulations, saying that which followeth: “Prepared is my heart, O God, I
will sing and play” (ver. 8). What hath he done to me? He hath prepared a pit, my heart is
prepared. He hath prepared pit to deceive, shall I not prepare heart to suffer? He hath pre-
pared pit to oppress, shall I not prepare heart to endure? Therefore he shall fall into it, but
I will sing and play. Hear the heart prepared in an Apostle, because he hath imitated his
Lord: “We glory,” he saith, “in tribulations: because tribulation worketh patience: patience
probation, probation hope, but hope maketh not ashamed: because the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, which hath been given to us.”2154 He was in
oppressions, in chains, in prisons, in stripes, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness,2155
in every wasting of toils and pains, and he was saying, “We glory in tribulations.” Whence,
but that prepared was his heart? Therefore he was singing and playing.
14. “Rise up, my glory” (ver. 9). He that had fled from the face of Saul into a cavern,
saith, “Rise up, my glory:” glorified be Jesus after His Passion. “Rise up, psaltery and harp.”
He calleth upon what to rise? Two organs I see: but Body of Christ one I see, one flesh hath
risen again, and two organs have risen. The one organ then is the psaltery, the other the
harp. Organs 2156 is the word used for all instruments of musicians. Not only is that called
2153 Muscipulam.
2154 Rom. v. 3.
2155 2 Cor. xi. 27.
2156 Organa.
Psalm LVII
an organ, which is great, and blown into with bellows;2157 but whatsoever is adapted to
playing and is corporeal, whereof for an instrument the player maketh use, is said to be an
organ. But distinguished from one another are these organs.2158…What therefore do these
two organs figure to us? For Christ the Lord our God is waking up His psaltery and His
harp; and He saith, “I will rise up at the dawn.” I suppose that here ye now perceive the Lord
rising. We have read thereof in the Gospel:2159 see the hour of the Resurrection. How long
through shadows was Christ being sought? He hath shone, be He acknowledged; “at the
dawn” He rose again. But what is psaltery? what is harp? Through His flesh two kinds of
deeds the Lord hath wrought, miracles and sufferings: miracles from above have been, suf-
ferings from below have been. But those miracles which He did were divine; but through
Body He did them, through flesh He did them. The flesh therefore working things divine,
is the psaltery: the flesh suffering things human is the harp. Let the psaltery sound, let the
blind be enlightened, let the deaf hear, let the paralytics be braced to strength, the lame walk,
the sick rise up, the dead rise again; this is the sound of the Psaltery. Let there sound also
the harp, let Him hunger, thirst, sleep, be held, scourged, derided, crucified, buried. When
therefore thou seest in that Flesh certain things to have sounded from above, certain things
from the lower part, one flesh hath risen again, and in one flesh we acknowledge both psaltery
and harp. And these two kinds of things done have fulfilled the Gospel, and it is preached
in the nations: for both the miracles and the sufferings of the Lord are preached.
15. Therefore there hath risen psaltery and harp in the dawn, and he confesseth to the
Lord; and saith what? “I will confess to Thee among the peoples, O Lord, and will play to
Thee among the nations: for magnified even unto the Heavens hath been Thy mercy, and
even unto the clouds Thy truth” (ver. 10). Heavens above clouds, and clouds below heavens:
and nevertheless to this nearest heaven belong clouds. But sometimes clouds rest upon the
mountains, even so far in the nearest air are they rolled. But a Heaven above there is, the
habitations of Angels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers. This therefore may
perchance seem to be what should have been said: “Unto the Heavens Thy truth, and even
unto the clouds Thy mercy.” For in Heaven Angels praise God, seeing the very form of truth,
without any darkness of vision, without any admixture of unreality: they see, love, praise,
are not wearied. There is truth: but here in our own misery surely there is mercy. For to a
miserable one must be rendered mercy. For there is no need of mercy above, where is no
miserable one. I have said this because that it seemeth as though it might have been more
2157 [Of which see a primitive example in Parker’s Glossary of Architecture (vol. i. p. 264), Oxford, 1845.

non-use in the Latin churches in the thirteenth century.—C.]

Psalm LVII
fittingly said, “Magnified even unto the Heavens hath been Thy truth, and even unto the
clouds Thy mercy.” For “clouds” we understand to be preachers of truth, men bearing that
flesh in a manner dark, whence God both gleameth in miracles, and thundereth in pre-
cepts.2160…Glory to our Lord, and to the Mercy of the Same, and to the Truth of the Same,
because neither hath He forsaken by mercy to make us blessed through His Grace, nor de-
frauded us of truth: because first Truth veiled in flesh came to us and healed through His
flesh the interior eye of our heart, in order that hereafter face to face we may be able to see
It.2161 Giving therefore to Him thanks, let us say with the same Psalm the last verses, which
sometime since too I have said, “Be Thou exalted above the Heavens, O God, and above all
the earth Thy glory” (ver. 11). For this to Him the Prophet said so many years before; this
now we see; this therefore let us also say.

Psalm LVII
Psalm LVIII.2162
1. The words which we have sung must be rather hearkened to by us, than proclaimed.
For to all men as it were in an assemblage of mankind, the Truth crieth, “If truly indeed
justice ye speak, judge right things, ye sons of men” (ver. 1). For to what unjust man is it
not an easy thing to speak justice? or what man if questioned about justice, when he hath
not a cause, would not easily answer what is just? Inasmuch as the hand of our Maker in
our very hearts hath written this truth, “That which to thyself thou wouldest not have done,
do not thou to another.”2163 Of this truth, even before that the Law was given, no one was
suffered to be ignorant, in order that there might be some rule whereby might be judged
even those to whom Law had not been given.2164 But lest men should complain that some-
thing had been wanting for them, there hath been written also in tables that which in their
hearts they read not. For it was not that they had it not written, but read it they would not.
There hath been set before their eyes that which in their conscience to see they would be
compelled; and as if from without the voice of God were brought to them, to his own inward
parts hath man been thus driven, the Scripture saying, “For in the thoughts of the ungodly
man there will be questioning.”2165 Where questioning is, there is law. But because men,
desiring those things which are without, even from themselves have become exiles, there
hath been given also a written law: not because in hearts it had not been written, but because
thou wast a deserter from thy heart, thou art seized by Him that is everywhere, and to thyself
within art called back. Therefore the written law, what crieth it, to those that have deserted
the law written in their hearts? 2166 “Return ye transgressors to the heart.”2167 For who hath
taught thee, that thou wouldest have no other man draw near thy wife? Who hath taught
thee, that thou wouldest not have a theft committed upon thee? Who hath taught thee, that
thou wouldest not suffer wrong, and whatever other thing either universally or particularly
might be spoken of? For many things there are, of which severally if questioned men with
loud voice would answer, that they would not suffer. Come, if thou art not willing to suffer
these things, art thou by any means the only man? dost thou not live in the fellowship of

Gentilism, as e.g. to Confucius. The glory of “the Golden Rule” is not merely that it gives a positive form to this
law: Christ made it the energetic and characteristic principle of His Church towards humanity, and of all
Christians towards all men.—C.]

Psalm LVIII
mankind? He that together with thee hath been made, is thy fellow; and all men have been
made after the image of God,2168 unless with earthly coverings they efface that which He
hath formed. That which therefore to thyself thou wilt not have to be done, do not thou to
another. For thou judgest that there is evil in that, which to suffer thou art not willing: and
this thing thou art constrained to know by an inward law; that in thy very heart is written.
Thou wast doing somewhat, and there was a cry raised in thy hands: how art thou constrained
to return to thy heart when this thing thou sufferest in the hands of others? Is theft a good
thing? No! I ask, is adultery a good thing? All cry, No! Is man-slaying a good thing? All cry,
that they abhor it. Is coveting the property of a neighbour a good thing? No! is the voice of
all men. Or if yet thou confessest not, there draweth near one that coveteth thy property:
be pleased to answer what thou wilt have. All men therefore, when of these things questioned,
cry that these things are not good. Again, of doing kindnesses, not only of not hurting, but
also of conferring and distributing, any hungry soul is questioned thus: “thou sufferest
hunger, another man hath bread, and there is abundance with him beyond sufficiency, he
knoweth thee to want, he giveth not: it displeaseth thee when hungering, let it displease thee
when full also, when of another’s hungering thou shalt have known. A stranger wanting
shelter cometh into thy country, he is not taken in: he then crieth that inhuman is that city,
at once among barbarians he might have found a home. He feeleth the injustice because he
suffereth; thou perchance feelest not, but it is meet that thou imagine thyself also a stranger;
and that thou see in what manner he will have displeased thee, who shall not have given
that, which thou in thy country wilt not give to a stranger.” I ask all men. True are these
things? True. Just are these things? Just. But hear ye the Psalm. “If truly therefore justice ye
speak, judge right things, ye sons of men.” Be it not a justice of lips, but also of deeds. For
if thou actest otherwise than thou speakest, good things thou speakest, and ill thou judgest.…
2. But now to the present case let us come, if ye please. For the voice is that sweet voice,
so well known to the ears of the Church, the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the voice
of His Body, the voice of the Church toiling, sojourning upon earth, living amid the perils
of men speaking evil and of men flattering. Thou wilt not fear a threatener, if thou lovest
not a flatterer. He therefore, of whom this is the voice, hath observed and hath seen, that all
men speak justice. For what man doth dare not to speak it, lest he be called unjust? When,
therefore, as though he were hearing the voices of all men, and were observing the lips of
all men, he cried out to them, “If truly indeed justice ye speak,”—if not falsely justice ye
speak, if not one thing on lips doth sound, whilst another thing is concealed in hearts,—“judge
right things, ye sons of men.” Hear out of the Gospel His own voice, the very same as is in
this Psalm: “Hypocrites,” saith the Lord to the Pharisees, “how are ye able good things to
speak, when ye are evil men?.…Either make the tree good, and the fruit thereof good: or
2168 Gen. i. 26.
Psalm LVIII
make the tree evil, and the fruit thereof evil.”2169 Why wilt thou whiten thee, wall of mud?
I know thy inward parts, I am not deceived by thy covering: I know what thou holdest forth,
I know what thou coverest. “For there was no need for Him, that any one to Him should
bear testimony of man: for He knew Himself what was in man.”2170 For He knew what was
in man, who had made man, and who had been made Man, in order that He might seek
man.…
3. But now ye do what? Why these things to you do I speak? “Because in heart iniquities
ye work on earth” (ver. 2). Iniquities perchance in heart alone? Hear what followeth: both
their heart hands do follow, and their heart hands do serve, the thing is thought of, and it
is done; or else it is not done, not because we would not, but because we could not, Whatever
thou willest and canst not, for done God doth count it. “For in heart Iniquities ye work on
earth.” What next? “Iniquities your hands knit together.” What is, “knit together”? From
sin, sin, and to sin, sin, because of sin. What is this? A theft a man hath committed, a sin it
is: he hath been seen, he seeketh to slay him by whom he hath been seen: there hath been
knit together sin with sin: God hath permitted him in His hidden judgment to slay that man
whom he hath willed to slay: he perceiveth that the thing is known, he seeketh to slay a
second also; he hath knit together a third sin: while these things he is planning, perchance
that he may not be found out, or that he may not be convicted of having done it, he consulteth
an astrologer; there is added a fourth sin: the astrologer answereth perchance with some
hard and evil responses, he runneth to a soothsayer, that expiation may be made; the
soothsayer maketh answer that he is not able to expiate: a magician is sought. And who
could enumerate those sins which are knit together with sins? “Iniquities your hands do
knit together.” So long as thou knittest together, thou bindest sin upon sin. Loose thyself
from sins. But I am not able, thou sayest. Cry to Him. “Unhappy man I, who shall deliver
me from the body of this death?”2171 For there shall come the Grace of God, so that right-
eousness shall be thy delight, as much as thou didst delight in iniquity; and thou, a man that
out of bonds hast been loosed, shall cry out to God, “Thou hast broken asunder my
bonds.”2172 “Thou hast broken asunder my bonds,” is what else but, “Thou hast remitted
my sins”? Hear why chains they are: the Scripture maketh answer, “with the chains of his
sins each one is bound fast.”2173 Not only bonds, but chains2174 also they are. Chains are

4. “Alienated are sinners from the womb, they have gone astray from the belly, they
have spoken false things” (ver. 3). And when iniquity they speak, false things they speak;
because deceitful is iniquity: and when justice they speak, false things they speak; because
one thing with mouth they profess, another thing in heart they conceal. “Alienated are sinners
from the womb.” What is this? Let us search more diligently: for perhaps he is saying this,
because God hath foreknown men that are to be sinners even in the wombs of their moth-
ers.2175 For whence when Rebecca was yet pregnant, and in womb was bearing twins, was
it said, “Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated”?2176 For it was said, “The elder shall serve
the younger.” Hidden at that time was the judgment of God: but yet from the womb, that
is, from the very origin, alienated are sinners. Whence alienated? From truth. Whence ali-
enated? From the blessed country, from the blessed life. Perchance alienated they are from
the very womb. And what sinners have been alienated from the womb? For what men would
have been born, if therein they had not been held? Or what men to-day would be alive to
hear these words to no purpose, unless they were born? Perchance therefore sinners have
been alienated from a certain womb, wherein that charity was suffering pains, which
speaketh through the Apostle, “Of whom again I am in labour, until Christ be formed in
you.”2177 Expect thou therefore; be formed: do not to thyself ascribe a judgment which
perchance thou knowest not. Carnal thou art as yet, conceived thou hast been: from that
very time when thou hast received the name of Christ, by a sort of sacrament thou hast been
born in the bowels of a mother. For not only out of bowels a man is born, but also in bowels.
First he is born in bowels, in order that he may be able to be born of bowels. Wherefore it
hath been said even to Mary, “For that which is born in thee, is of the Holy Spirit.”2178 Not
yet of Her It had been born, but already in Her It had been born. Therefore there are born
within the bowels of the Church certain little ones, and a good thing it is that being formed
they should go forth, so that they drop not by miscarriage. Let the mother bear thee, not
miscarry. If patient thou shalt have been, even until thou be formed, even until in thee there
be the sure doctrine of truth, the maternal bowels ought to keep thee. But if by thy impatience
thou shalt have shaken the sides of thy mother, with pain indeed she expelleth thee out, but
more to thy loss than to hers.
5. For this reason therefore have they gone astray from the belly, because “they have
spoken false things”? Or rather have they not for this reason spoken false things, because

2177 Gal. iv. 19.
2178 Matt. i. 20; Luke i. 35.
Psalm LVIII
they have gone astray from the belly? For in the belly of the Church truth abideth. Whosoever
from this belly of the Church separated shall have been, must needs speak false things: must
needs, I say, speak false things; whoso either conceived would not be, or whom when con-
ceived the mother hath expelled. Thence heretics exclaim against the Gospel (to speak in
preference of those whom expelled we lament). We repeat to them: behold Christ hath said,
“It behoved Christ to suffer, and from the dead to rise again the third day.”2179 I acknowledge
there our Head, I acknowledge there our bridegroom: acknowledge thou also with me the
Bride.…
6. “Indignation to them after the similitude of a serpent” (ver. 4). A great thing ye are
to hear. “Indignation to them after the similitude of a serpent.” As if we had said, What is
that which thou hast said? there followeth, “As if of a deaf asp.” Whence deaf? “And closing
its ears.” Therefore deaf, because it closeth its ears. “And closing its ears.” “Which will not
hearken to the voice of men charming, and of the medicine medicated by the wise man”
(ver. 5). As we have heard, because even men speak who have learned it with such research
as they were able, but nevertheless it is a thing which the Spirit of God knoweth much better
than any men. For it is not to no purpose that of this he hath spoken, but because it may
chance that true is even that which we have heard of the asp. When the asp beginneth to be
affected by the Marsian charmer, who calleth it forth with certain peculiar incantations,
hear what it doeth.…Give heed what is spoken to thee for a simile’s sake, what is noted thee
for avoidance.2180 So therefore here also there hath been given a certain simile derived from
the Marsian, who maketh incantation to bring forth the asp from the dark cavern; surely
into light he would bring it: but it loving its darkness, wherein coiled up it hideth itself,
when it will not choose to come forth, nevertheless refusing to hear those words whereby
it feeleth itself to be constrained, is said to press one ear against the ground, and with its tail
to stop up the other, and therefore as much as possible escaping those words, it cometh not
forth to the charmer. To this as being like, the Spirit of God hath spoken of certain persons
hearing not the Word of God, and not only not doing, but altogether, that they may not do
it, refusing to hear.
7. This thing hath been done even in the first times of the faith. Stephen the Martyr was
preaching the Truth, and to minds as though dark, in order to bring them forth into light,
was making incantation: when he came to make mention of Christ, whom they would not
hear at all, of them the Scripture saith what? of them relateth what? “They shut,” he saith,
“their ears.”2181 But what they did afterwards, the narrative of the passion of Stephen doth
publish. They were not deaf, but they made themselves deaf.…For this thing they did at the
2179 Luke xxiv. 46.
2180 So. p. 133.
2181 Acts vii. 57.
Psalm LVIII
point where Christ was named. The indignation of these men was as the indignation of a
serpent. Why your ears do ye shut? Wait, hear, and if ye shall be able, rage. Because they
chose not to do aught but rage, they would not hear. But if they had heard, perchance they
would have ceased to rage. The indignation of them was as the indignation of a serpent.…
8. “God hath broken utterly the teeth of them in their own mouth” (ver. 6). Of whom?
Of them to whom indignation is as the similitude of a serpent, and of an asp closing up its
ears, so that it heareth not the voice of men charming, and of medicine medicated by the
wise man. The Lord hath done to them what? “Hath broken utterly the teeth of them in
their own mouth.” It hath been done, this at first hath been done, and now is being done.
But it would have sufficed, my brethren, that it should have been said, “God hath broken
utterly the teeth of them.” The Pharisees would not hear the Law, would not hear the precepts
of truth from Christ, being like to that serpent and asp. For in their past sins they took delight,
and present life they would not lose, that is, joys earthly for joys heavenly.…What is, “in
their own mouth”? In such sort, that with their own mouth against themselves they should
make declaration: He hath compelled them with their mouth against themselves to give
sentence. They would have slandered Him, because of the tribute:2182 He said not, “It is
lawful to pay tribute,” or, “It is not lawful to pay tribute.” And He willed to break utterly
their teeth, wherewith they were gaping in order to bite; but in their own mouth He would
do it. If He said, Let there be paid to Cæsar tribute, they would have slandered Him, because
He had spoken evil to the nation of the Jews, by making it a tributary. For because of sin
they were paying tribute, having been humbled, as to them in the Law had been foretold.
We have Him, say they, a maligner of our nation, if He shall have bidden us to pay tribute:
but if He say, Do not pay, we have Him for saying that we should not be under allegiance
to Cæsar. Such a double noose as it were to catch the Lord they laid. But to whom had they
come? To Him that knew how to break utterly the teeth of them in their own mouth. “Show
to Me the coin,”2183 He saith. Why tempt ye Me, ye hypocrites?” Of paying tribute do ye
think? To do justice are ye willing? the counsel of justice do ye seek? “If truly justice ye speak,
judge right things, ye sons of men.” But now because in one way ye speak, in another way
judge, hypocrites ye are: “Why tempt ye Me, ye hypocrites?” Now I will break utterly your
teeth in your mouth: “show to Me the coin.” And they showed it to Him. And He saith not,
it is Cæsar’s: but asketh Whose it is? in order that their teeth in their own mouth might be
utterly broken. For on His inquiring, of whom it had the image and inscription, they said,
of Cæsar. Even now the Lord shall break utterly the teeth of them in their own mouth. Now
ye have made answer, now have been broken utterly your teeth in your mouth. “Render
unto Cæsar the things which are of Cæsar, and unto God the things which are of God.” 2184
2182 Matt. xxii. 17, 18.
2183 Matt. xxii. 19.
2184 Matt. xxii. 21.
Psalm LVIII
Cæsar seeketh his image; render it: God seeketh His image; render it. Let not Cæsar lose
from you his coin: let not God lose in you His coin. And they found not what they might
answer. For they had been sent to slander Him: and they went back, saying, that no one to
Him could make answer. Wherefore? Because broken utterly had been the teeth of them in
their own mouth. Of that sort is also the following: “In what power doest Thou these things?
I also will ask of you one question, answer me.”2185 And He asked them of John, whence
was the Baptism of John, from heaven, or of men? so that whatever they might answer might
tell against themselves.…
9. The Lord displeased that Pharisee, who to dinner had bidden Him, because a woman
that was a sinner drew near to His feet, and he murmured against Him, saying, “If this man
were a prophet, He would know what woman drew near to His feet.”2186 O thou that art
no prophet, whence knowest thou that He knew not what woman drew near to His feet?
Because indeed He kept not the purifying of the Jews, which outwardly was as it were kept
in the flesh, and was afar from the heart, this thing he suspected of the Lord. And in order
that I may not speak at length on this point, even in his mouth He willed to break utterly
the teeth of him. For He set forth to him: “A certain usurer had two debtors, one was owing
five hundred pence, the other fifty: both had not wherewithal to pay, he forgave both. Which
loved him the more?”2187 To this end the one asketh, that the other may answer: to this end
he answereth that the teeth of him in his mouth may be broken utterly.…
10. “The jaw-bones of lions the Lord hath broken utterly.”2188 Not only of asps. What
of asps? Asps treacherously desire to throw in their venom, and scatter it, and hiss. Most
openly raged the nations, and roared like lions. “Wherefore have raged the nations, and the
peoples meditated empty things?”2189 When they were lying in wait for the Lord. Is it lawful
to give tribute to Cæsar, or is it not lawful?2190 Asps they were, serpents they were, broken
utterly were the teeth of them in their own mouth. Afterwards they cried out, “Crucify,
Crucify.”2191 Now is there no tongue of asp, but roar of lion. But also “the jaw-bones of
lions the Lord hath broken utterly.” Perchance here there is no need of that which he hath
not added, namely, “in the mouth of them.” For men lying in wait with captious questions,
were forced to be conquered with their own answer: but those men that openly were raging,
were they by any means to be confuted with questions? Nevertheless, even their jaw-bones

were broken utterly: having been crucified, He rose again, ascended into heaven, was glorified
as the Christ, is adored by all nations, adored by all kings. Let the Jews now rage, if they are
able. We have also in the case of heretics this as a warning and precedent, because themselves
also we find to be serpents with indignation made deaf, not choosing to hear the “medicine
medicated by the wise man:” and in their own mouth the Lord hath broken utterly the teeth
of them.…
11. “They shall be despised like water running down” (ver. 7). Be not terrified, brethren,
by certain streams, which are called torrents: with winter waters they are filled up; do not
fear: after a little it passeth by, that water runneth down; for a time it roareth, soon it will
subside: they cannot hold long. Many heresies now are utterly dead: they have run in their
channels as much as they were able, have run down, dried are the channels, scarce of them
the memory is found, or that they have been. “They shall be despised like water running
down.” But not they alone; the whole of this age for a time is roaring, and is seeking whom
it may drag along. Let all ungodly men, all proud men resounding against the rocks of their
pride as it were with waters rushing along and flowing together, not terrify you, winter waters
they are, they cannot alway flow: it must needs be that they run down unto their place, unto
their end. And nevertheless of this torrent of the world the Lord hath drunk. For He hath
suffered here, the very torrent He hath drunk, but in the way He hath drunk, but in the
passage over: because in way of sinners He hath not stood.2192 But of Him saith the Scripture
what? “Of the torrent in the way He shall drink, therefore He shall lift up His Head;”2193
that is, for this reason glorified He hath been, because He hath died; for this reason hath
risen again, because He hath suffered.…
12. “Like wax melted they shall be taken away” (ver. 8). For thou wast about to say, all
men are not so made weak, like myself, in order that they may believe: many men do per-
severe in their evil, and in their malice. And of the same fear thou nothing: “Like wax melted
they shall be taken away.” Against thee they shall not stand, they shall not continue: with a
sort of fire of their own lusts they shall perish. For there is here a kind of hidden punish-
ment,2194 of it the Psalm is about to speak now, to the end of it. There are but a few verses;
be attentive. There is a certain punishment future, fire of hell, fire everlasting. For future
punishment hath two kinds: either of the lower places it is, where was burning that rich
man, who was wishing for himself a drop of water to be dropped on his tongue off the finger
of the poor man, whom before his gate he had spurned, when he saith, “For I am tormented
in this flame.” 2195 And the second is that at the end, whereof they are to hear, that on the
2192 Ps. i. 1.
2193 Ps. cx. 7.
2194 Hidden punishment of sinners.
2195 Luke xvi. 24.
Psalm LVIII
left hand are to be set: “Go ye into fire everlasting, that hath been prepared for the devil and
his angels.”2196 Those punishments shall be manifest at that time, when we shall have de-
parted out of this life, or when at the end of the world men shall have come to the resurrection
of the dead. Now therefore is there no punishment, and doth God suffer sins utterly unpun-
ished even unto that day? There is even here a sort of hidden punishment, of the same he
is treating now.…We see nevertheless sometimes with these punishments just men to be
afflicted, and to these punishments unjust men to be strangers: for which reason did totter
the feet of him that afterwards rejoicing saith, “How good is the God of Israel to men right
in heart! But my own feet have been almost shaken, because I have been jealous in the case
of sinners, beholding the peace of sinners.”2197 For he had seen the felicity of evil men, and
well-pleased he had been to be an evil man, seeing evil men to reign, seeing that it was well
with them, that they abounded in plenty of all things temporal, such as he too, being as yet
but a babe, was desiring from the Lord: and his feet did totter, even until he saw what at the
end is either to be hoped for or to be feared. For he saith in the same Psalm, “This thing is
a labour before me, until I enter into the sanctuary of God, and understand unto the last
things.”2198 It is not therefore the punishments of the lower places, not the punishments of
that fire everlasting after the resurrection, not those punishments which as yet in this world
are common to just men and unjust men, and ofttimes more heavy are those of just men
than those of unjust men; but some punishment or other of the present life the Spirit of God
would recommend to our notice. Give heed, hear ye me about to speak of that which ye
know: but a more sweet thing it is when it is declared in a Psalm, which, before it was de-
clared, was deemed obscure. For behold I bring forth that which already ye knew: but because
these things are brought forth from a place where ye have never yet seen them, it cometh
to pass that even known things, as if they were new things, do delight you. Hear ye the
punishment of ungodly men: “Like wax,” he saith, “melted they shall be taken away.” I have
said that through their lusts this thing to them is done. Evil lust is like a burning and a fire.
Doth fire consume a garment, and doth not the lust of adultery consume the soul? Of
meditated adultery when the Scripture was speaking it saith, “Shall one bind fire in his
bosom, and his garments shall he not burn up?”2199 Thou bearest in thy bosom live coals;
burned through is thy vest; thou bearest in thought adultery, and whole then is thy soul?
But these punishments few men do see: therefore them the Spirit of God doth exceedingly
recommend to our notice. Hear the Apostle saying, “God hath given them up unto the lusts
of their heart.”2200 Behold, the fire from the face of which like wax they are melting. For
2196 Matt. xxv. 41.
2197 Ps. lxxiii. 1–3.
2198 Ps. lxxiii. 16, 17.
2199 Prov. vi. 27.
2200 Rom. i. 24.
Psalm LVIII
they loose themselves from a certain continence of chastity; therefore even these same men,
going unto their lusts, as loose and melting are spoken of. Whence melting? whence loose?
From the fire of lusts. “God hath given them up unto the lusts of their heart, so that they do
those things which beseem not, being filled full of all iniquity.”…
13. “There hath fallen upon them fire, and they have not seen the sun.” Ye see in what
manner he speaketh of a certain punishment of darkening. “Fire hath fallen upon them,”
fire of pride, a smoky fire, fire of lust, fire of wrath. How great a fire is it? He upon whom
it shall have fallen, shall not see the sun. Therefore hath it been said, “Let not the sun go
down upon your wrath.”2201 Therefore, brethren, fire of evil lust fear ye, if ye will not melt
like wax, and to perish from the face of God. For there falleth upon you that fire, and the
sun ye shall not see. What sun? Not that which together with thee see both beasts and insects,
and good men and evil men: because “He maketh His sun to rise upon good men and evil
men.”2202 But there is another sun, whereof those men are to speak, “And the sun hath not
risen to us, passed away are all those things as it were a shadow. Therefore we have strayed
from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shone to us, and the sun hath
not risen to us.”2203…
14. “Before that the bramble2204 bringeth forth your thorns: as though living, as though
in anger, it shall drink them up” (ver. 9). What is the bramble? Of prickly plants it is a kind,
upon which there are said to be certain of the closest thorns. At first it is a herb; and while
it is a herb, soft and fair it is: but thereon there are nevertheless thorns to come forth. Now
therefore sins are pleasant, and as it were they do not prick. A herb is the bramble; even
now nevertheless there is a thorn. “Before that the bramble bringeth forth thorns:” is before
that of miserable delights and pleasures the evident tortures come forth. Let them question
themselves that love any object, and to it cannot attain; let them see if they are not racked
with longing: and when they have attained to that which unlawfully they long for, let them
mark if they are not racked with fear. Let them see therefore here their punishments; before
that there cometh that resurrection, when in flesh rising again they shall not be changed.
“For all we shall rise again, but not2205 all we shall be changed.”2206 For they shall have the
corruption of the flesh wherein to be pained, not that wherein to die: otherwise even those
pains would be ended. Then the thorns of that bramble, that is, all pains and piercings of

ceived reading.
2206 1 Cor. xv. 51.
Psalm LVIII
tortures shall be brought forth. Such thorns as they shall suffer that are to say, “These are
they whom sometimes we had in derision:”2207 thorns of the piercing of repentance, but of
one too late and without fruit like the barrenness of thorns. The repentance of this time is
pain healing: repentance of that time is pain penal. Wouldest thou not suffer those thorns?
here be thou pierced with the thorns of repentance; in such sort that thou do that which
hath been spoken of, “Turned I have been in sorrow, when the thorn was piercing:2208 my
sin I have known, and mine iniquity I have not covered: I have said, I will declare against
me my shortcoming to the Lord, and Thou hast remitted the ungodliness of my heart.”2209
Now do so, now be pierced through, be there not in thee done that which hath been said of
certain execrable men, “They have been cloven asunder, and have not been pierced
through.”2210 Observe them that have been cloven asunder and have not been pierced
through.2211 Ye see men cloven asunder, and ye see them not pierced through. Behold beside
the Church they are, and it doth not repent them, so as they should return whence they have
been cloven asunder. The bramble hereafter shall bring forth their thorns. They will not
now have a healing piercing through, they shall have hereafter one penal. But even now
before that the bramble produceth thorns, there hath fallen upon them fire, that suffereth
them not to see the sun, that is, the wrath of God is drinking up them while still living: fire
of evil lusts, of empty honours, of pride, of their covetousness: and whatsoever is weighing
them down, that they should not know the truth, so that they seem not to be conquered, so
that they be not brought into subjection even by truth herself. For what is a more glorious
thing, brethren, than to be brought in subjection and to be overcome by truth? Let truth
overcome thee willing: for even unwilling she shall of herself overcome thee.…
15. As yet the punishments of the lower places have not come, as yet fire everlasting
hath not come: let him that is growing in God compare himself now with an ungodly man,
a blind heart with an enlightened heart: compare ye two men, one seeing and one not seeing
in the flesh. And what so great thing is vision of the flesh? Did Tobias by any means have
fleshly eyes?2212 His own son had, and he had not; and the way of life a blind man to one
seeing did show. Therefore when ye see that punishment, rejoice, because in it ye are not.
Therefore saith the Scripture, “The just man shall rejoice when he shall have seen ven-
geance” (ver. 10). Not that future punishment; for see what followeth: “his hands he shall

Psalm LVIII
wash in the blood of the sinner.” What is this? Let your love attend. When man-slayers are
smitten, ought anywise innocent men to go thither and wash their hands? But what is, “in
the blood of the sinner he shall wash his hands”? When a just man seeth the punishment of
a sinner, he groweth himself; and the death of one is the life of another. For if spiritually
blood runneth from those that within are dead, do thou, seeing such vengeance, wash therein
thy hands; for the future more cleanly live. And how shall he wash his hands, if a just man
he is? For what hath he on his hands to be washed, if just he is? “But the just man of faith
shall live.”2213 Just men therefore he hath called believers: and from the time that thou hast
believed, at once thou beginnest to be called just. For there hath been made a remission of
sins. Even if out of that remaining part of thy life some sins are thine, which cannot but flow
in, like water from the sea into the hold; nevertheless, because thou hast believed, when thou
shalt have seen him that altogether is turned away from God to be slain in that blindness,
there falling upon him that fire so that he see not the sun—then do thou that now through
faith seest Christ, in order that thou mayest see in substance (because the just man liveth of
faith), observe the ungodly man dying, and purge thyself from sins. So thou shalt wash in
a manner thy hands in the blood of the sinner.
16. “And a man shall say, If therefore there is fruit to a just man” (ver. 10). Behold, before
that there cometh that which is promised, before that there is given life everlasting, before
that ungodly men are cast forth into fire everlasting, here in this life there is fruit to the just
man. What fruit? “In hope rejoicing, in tribulation enduring.”2214 What fruit to the just
man? “We glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, but patience
probation, but probation hope: but hope confoundeth not: because the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, that hath been given to us.”2215 Doth he rejoice
that is a drunkard; and doth he not rejoice that is just? In love there is fruit to a just man.
Miserable the one, even when he maketh himself drunken: blessed the other, even when he
hungereth and thirsteth. The one wine-bibbing doth gorge, the other hope doth feed. Let
him see therefore the punishment of the other, his own rejoicing, and let him think of God.
He that hath given even now such joy of faith, of hope, of charity, of the truth of His Scrip-
tures, what manner of joy is He making ready against the end? In the way thus He feedeth,
in his home how shall He fill him? “And a man shall say, If therefore there is fruit to the just
man.” Let them that see believe, and see, and perceive. Rejoice shall the just man when he
shall have seen vengeance. But if he hath not eyes whence he may see vengeance, he will be
made sad, and will not be amended by it. But if he seeth it, he seeth what difference there is
between the darkened eye of the heart, and the eye enlightened of the heart: between the
2213 Rom. i. 17.
2214 Rom. xii. 12.
2215 Rom. v. 3–5.
Psalm LVIII
coolness of chastity and the flame of lust, between the security of hope and the fear there is
in crime. When he shall have seen this, let him separate himself, and wash his hands in the
blood of the same. Let him profit by the comparison, and say, “Therefore there is fruit to
the just man: therefore there is a God judging them in the earth.” Not yet in that life, not
yet in fire eternal, not yet in the lower places, but here in earth.…
17. If somewhat too prolix we have been, pardon us. We exhort you in the name of
Christ, to meditate profitably on those things which ye have heard. Because even to preach
the truth is nought, if heart from tongue dissenteth; and to hear the truth nothing profiteth,
if a man upon the rock build not. He that buildeth upon a Rock, is the same that heareth
and doeth:2216 but he that heareth and doeth not, buildeth upon sand: he that neither heareth
nor doeth, buildeth nothing.…
2216 Matt. vii. 24.
Psalm LVIII
Psalm LIX.2217
The First Part.
1. As the Scripture is wont to set mysteries of the Psalms on the titles, and to deck the
brow of a Psalm with the high announcement of a Mystery,2218 in order that we that are
about to go in may know (when as it were upon the door-post we have read what within is
doing) either of whom the house is, or who is the owner of that estate: so also in this Psalm
there hath been written a title, of a title. For it hath, “At the end, corrupt not for David
himself unto the inscription of the title.” This is that which I have spoken of, title of Title.
For what the inscription of this title is, which to be corrupted he forbiddeth, the Gospel to
us doth indicate. For when the Lord was being crucified, a title by Pilate was inscribed and
set, “King of the Jews,”2219 in three tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin:2220 which tongues
in the whole world mostly do prevail.…Therefore “corrupt not” is most proper and proph-
etic; since indeed even those Jews made suggestion at that time to Pilate, and said, “Do not
write King of the Jews, but write, that Himself said that He was King of the Jews:”2221 for
this title, say they, hath established Him King over us. And Pilate, “What I have written, I
have written.” And there was fulfilled, “corrupt not.”
2. Nor is this the only Psalm which hath an inscription of such sort, that the Title be
not corrupted. Several Psalms thus are marked on the face, but however in all the Passion
of the Lord is foretold. Therefore here also let us perceive the Lord’s Passion, and let there
speak to us Christ, Head and Body. So always, or nearly always, let us hear the words of
Christ from the Psalm, as that we look not only upon that Head, the one mediator between
God and man, the Man Christ Jesus.2222…But let us think of Christ, Head and whole Body,
a sort of entire Man. For to us is said, “But ye are the Body of Christ and members,”2223 by
the Apostle Paul. If therefore He is Head, we Body; whole Christ is Head and Body. For
sometimes thou findest words which do not suit the Head, and unless thou shalt have attached
them to the Body, thy understanding will waver: again thou findest words which are proper
for the Body, and Christ nevertheless is speaking. In that place we must have no fear lest a
man be mistaken: for quickly he proceedeth to adapt to the Head, that which he seeth is not
proper for the Body.…

3. Let us hear, therefore, what followeth: “When Saul sent and guarded his house in
order that he might kill him.” This though not to the Cross of the Lord, yet to the Passion
of the Lord doth belong. For Crucified was Christ, and dead, and buried. That sepulchre
was therefore as it were the house: to guard which the government of the Jews sent, when
guards were set to the sepulchre of Christ.2224 There is indeed a story in the Scripture of
the Reigns, of the occasion when Saul sent to guard the house in order that he might kill
David.2225…But in like manner as Saul effected not his purpose of slaying David: so this
could not the government of the Jews effect, that the testimony of guards sleeping should
avail more than that of Apostles watching. For what were the guards instructed to say? We
give to you, they say, as much money as ye please; and say ye, that while ye were sleeping
there came His disciples, and took Him away. Behold what sort of witnesses of falsehood
against truth and the Resurrection of Christ, His enemies, through Saul figured, did produce.
Enquire, O unbelief, of sleeping witnesses, let them reply to thee of what was done in the
tomb. Who, if they were sleeping, whence knew it? If watching, wherefore detained they
not the thieves? Let him say therefore what followeth.
4. “Deliver me from mine enemies, my God, and from men rising up upon me, redeem
Thou me” (ver. 1). There hath been done this thing in the flesh of Christ, it is being done
in us also. For our enemies, to wit the devil and his angels, cease not to rise up upon us every
day, and to wish to make sport of our weakness and our frailness, by deceptions, by sugges-
tions, by temptations, and by snares of whatsoever sort to entangle us, while on earth we
are still living. But let our voice watch unto God, and cry out in the members of Christ, under
the Head that is in heaven, “Deliver me from mine enemies, my God, and from men rising
up upon me, redeem Thou me.”
5. “Deliver me from men working iniquity, and from men of bloods, save Thou me”
(ver. 2). They indeed were men of bloods, who slew the Just One, in whom no guilt they
found: they were men of bloods, because when the foreigner washed his hands, and would
have let go Christ, they cried, “Crucify, Crucify:”2226 they were men of bloods, on whom
when there was being charged the crime of the blood of Christ, they made answer, giving
it to their posterity to drink, “His blood be upon us and upon our sons.”2227 But neither
against His Body did men of bloods cease to rise up; for even after the Resurrection and
Ascension of Christ, the Church suffered persecutions, and she indeed first that grew out
of the Jewish people, of which also our Apostles were. There at first Stephen was stoned,2228

and received that of which he had his name. For Stephanus doth signify a crown. Lowly
stoned but highly crowned. Secondly, among the Gentiles rose up kingdoms of Gentiles,
before that in them was fulfilled that which had been foretold, “There shall adore Him all
the kings of the earth, all nations shall serve Him:”2229 and there roared the fierceness of
that kingdom against the witnesses of Christ: there was shed largely and frequently the blood
of Martyrs: wherewith when it had been shed, being as it were sown, the field of the Church
more productively put forth, and filled the whole world as we now behold. From these
therefore, men of bloods, is delivered Christ, not only Head, but also Body. From men of
bloods is delivered Christ, both from them that have been, and from them that are, and
from them that are to be; there is delivered Christ, both He that hath gone before, and He
that is, and He that is to come. For Christ is the whole Body of Christ; and whatsoever good
Christians that now are, and that have been before us, and that after us are to be, are an
whole Christ, who is delivered from men of bloods; nor is this voice void, “And from men
of bloods save Thou me.”
6. “For behold they have hunted my soul.…There have rushed upon me strong men”
(ver. 3). We must not however pass on from these strong men: diligently we must trace who
are the strong men rising up. Strong men, upon whom but upon weak men, upon powerless
men, upon men not strong? And praised nevertheless are the weak men, and condemned
are the strong men. If it would be perceived who are strong men, at first the devil himself
the Lord hath called a strong man: “No one,” He saith, “is able to go into the house of a
strong man, and to carry off his vessels, unless first he shall have bound the strong man.”2230
He hath bound therefore the strong man with the chains of His dominion: and his vessels
He hath carried off, and His own vessels hath made them. For all unrighteous men were
vessels of the devil.…But there are among mankind certain strong men of a blameable and
damnable strength, that are confident indeed, but on temporal felicity. That man doth
not2231 seem to you to have been strong, of whom now from the Gospel2232 hath been read:
how his estate brought forth abundance of fruits, and he being troubled, hit upon the design
of rebuilding, so that, having pulled down his old barns, he should construct new ones more
capacious, and, these having been finished, should say to his soul, “Thou hast many good
things, soul, feast, be merry, be filled.”…There are also other men strong, not because of
riches, not because of the powers of the body, not because of any temporally pre-eminent
power of station, but relying on their righteousness. This sort of strong men must be guarded
2229 Ps. lxxi. 11.
2230 Matt. xii. 29.
2231 Perhaps “doth not that man.”
2232 Luke xii. 16.
Part 1
against, feared, repulsed, not imitated: of men relying, I say, not on body, not on means,
not on descent, not on honour; for all such things who would not see to be temporal, fleeting,
falling, flying? but relying on their own righteousness.…“Wherefore,” say they, doth your
Master eat with publicans and sinners?2233 O ye strong men, to whom a Physician is not
needful! This strength to soundness belongeth not, but to insanity. For even than men
frenzied nothing can be stronger, more mighty they are than whole men: but by how much
greater their powers are, by so much nearer is their death. May God therefore turn away
from our imitation these strong men.…The same are therefore the strong men, that assailed
Christ, commending their own justice. Hear ye these strong men: when certain men of Jer-
usalem were speaking, having been sent by them to take Christ, and not daring to take Him
(because when he would, then was He taken, that truly was strong): Why therefore, say they,
“could ye not take Him?” And they made answer, “No one of men did ever so speak as He.”
And these strong men, “Hath by any means any one of the Pharisees believed on Him, or
any one of the Scribes, but this people knowing not the Law?”2234 They preferred themselves
to the sick multitude, that was running to the Physician: whence but because they were
themselves strong? and what is worse, by their strength, all the multitude also they brought
over unto themselves, and slew the Physician of all.…
7. What next? “Neither iniquity is mine, nor sin mine, O Lord” (ver. 4). There have
rushed on indeed strong men on their own righteousness relying, they have rushed on, but
sin in me they have not found. For truly those strong men, that is, as it were righteous men,
on what account would they be able to persecute Christ, unless it were as if a sinner? But,
however, let them look to it how strong they be, in the raging of fever not in the vigour of
soundness: let them look to it how strong they be, and how as though just against an unright-
eous man they have raged.2235 But, however, “neither iniquity is mine, nor sin mine, O
Lord. Without iniquity I did run, and I was guided.” Those strong men therefore could not
follow me running: therefore a sinner they have deemed me, because my steps they have
not seen.
8. “Without iniquity I did run, and was guided; rise up to meet me, and see.” To God
is said this. But why? If He meet not, is He unable to see? It is just as if thou wast walking
in a road, and from afar by some one thou couldest not be recognised, thou wouldest call
to him and wouldest say, Meet me, and see how I am walking; for when from afar thou es-
piest me, my steps thou art not able to see. So also unless God were to meet, would He not
see how without iniquity he was guided, and how without sin he was running? This inter-
2233 Matt. ix. 11.
2234 John vii. 45–49.
2235 Oxf. mss. “and how far they were righteous and raging against one unrighteous” (et quam justi contra
iniquum sævierint). The common reading is scarcely grammatical.
Part 1
pretation indeed we can also accept, namely, “Rise up to meet me,” as if “help me.” But that
which he hath added, “and see,” must be understood as, make it to be seen that I run, make
it to be seen that I am guided: according to that figure wherein this also hath been said to
Abraham, “Now I know that thou fearest God.”2236 God saith, “Now I know:” whence, but
because I have made thee to know? For unknown to himself every one is before the ques-
tioning of temptation: just as of himself Peter2237 in his confidence was ignorant, and by
denying learned what kind of powers he had, in his very stumbling he perceived that it was
falsely he had been confident: he wept, and in weeping he earned profitably to know what
he was, and to be what he was not. Therefore Abraham when tried, became known to himself:
and it was said by God, “Now I know,” that is, now I have made thee to know. In like manner
as glad is the day because it maketh men glad; and sad is bitterness because it maketh sad
one tasting thereof: so God’s seeing is making to see. “Rise up, therefore,” he saith, “to meet
me, and see” (ver. 5). What is, “and see”? And help me, that is, in those men, in order that
they may see my course, may follow me; let not that seem to them to be crooked which is
straight, let not that seem to them to be curved which keepeth the rule of truth.
9. Something else I am admonished to say in this place of the loftiness of our Head
Himself: for He was made weak even unto death, and He took on Him the weakness of flesh,
in order that the chickens of Jerusalem He might gather under His wings, like a hen showing
herself weak with her little ones.2238 For have we not observed this thing in some bird at
some time or other, even in those which build nests before our eyes, as the house-sparrows,
as swallows, so to speak, our annual guests, as storks, as various sorts of birds, which before
our eyes build nests, and hatch eggs, feed chickens, as the very doves which daily we see;
and some bird to become weak with her chickens, have we not known, have we not looked
upon, have we not seen? In what way doth a hen experience this weakness? Surely a known
fact I am speaking of, which in our sight is daily taking place. How her voice groweth hoarse,
how her whole body is made languid? The wings droop, the feathers are loosened, and thou
seest around the chickens some sick thing, and this is maternal love which is found as
weakness. Why was it therefore, but for this reason, that the Lord willed to be as a Hen,
saying in the Holy Scripture, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often have I willed to gather thy
sons, even as a hen her chickens under her wings, and thou hast not been willing.” But He
hath gathered all nations, like as a hen her chickens.…
10. “And Thou, Lord God of virtues, God of Israel.” Thou God of Israel, that art thought
to be but God of one nation, which worshippeth Thee, when all nations worship idols, Thou
God of Israel, “Give heed unto the visiting all nations.” Fulfilled be that prophecy wherein
2236 Gen. xxii. 12.
2237 Matt. xxvi. 35–69.
2238 Matt. xxiii. 37.
Part 1
Isaiah in Thy person speaketh to Thy Church, Thy holy City, that barren one of whom many
more are the sons of Her forsaken than of her that hath a husband. To Her indeed hath been
said, “Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not,”2239 etc., more than of the Jewish nation which
hath a Husband, which hath received the Law, more than of that nation which had a visible
king. For thy king is hidden, and more sons to thee there are by a hidden Bridegroom.…The
Prophet addeth, “Enlarge the place of Thy tabernacle, and Thy2240 courts fix thou: there is
no cause for thee to spare, extend further thy cords, and strong stakes set thou again and
again on the right and on the left.”2241 Upon the right keep good men, on the left keep evil
men,2242 until there come the fan:2243 occupy nevertheless all nations; bidden to the marriage
be good men and evil men, filled be the marriage with guests;2244 it is the office of servants
to bid, of the Lord to sever. “Cities which had been forsaken Thou shall inhabit:”2245 forsaken
of God, forsaken of Prophets, forsaken of Apostles, forsaken of the Gospel, full of demons.
For Thou shalt prevail; and blush not because abominable Thou hast been. Therefore though
there have risen up upon thee strong men, blush not: when against the name of Christ laws
were enacted, when ignominy and infamy it was to be a Christian. “Blush not because ab-
ominable Thou hast been: for confusion for everlasting Thou shalt forget, of the ignominy
of Thy widowhood Thou shall not be mindful.”…
11. “Have not pity upon all men that work iniquity.” Here evidently He is terrifying.
Whom would He not terrify? What man falling back upon his own conscience would not
tremble? Which even if to itself it is conscious of godliness, strange if it be not in some sort
conscious of iniquity. For whosoever doeth sin, also doeth iniquity.2246 “For if Thou shalt
have marked iniquities, O Lord, what man shall abide it?”2247 And nevertheless a true saying
it is, and not said to no purpose, and neither is nor will it be possible to be void, “Have not
pity upon all men that work iniquity.” But He had pity even upon Paul, who at first as Saul
wrought iniquity. For what good thing did he, whence he might deserve of God? Did he not
hate His Saints unto death?2248 did he not bear letters from the chief of the priests, to the
end that wheresoever he might find Christians, to punishment he should hurry them? When

bent upon this, when thither proceeding, breathing and panting slaughter, as the Scripture
testified of him, was he not from Heaven with a mighty voice summoned, thrown down,
raised up; blinded, lightened; slain, made alive; destroyed, restored? In return for what
merit? Let us say nothing; himself rather let us hear: “I that before have been,” he saith, “a
blasphemer, and persecutor; and injurious, but mercy I have obtained.”2249 Surely “Thou
wouldest not have pity upon all men that work iniquity:” this in two ways may be understood:
either that in fact not any sins doth God leave unpunished; or that there is a sort of iniquity,
on the workers whereof God hath indeed no pity.
12. All iniquity, be it little or great, punished must needs be, either by man himself re-
penting, or by God avenging. For even he that repenteth punisheth himself. Therefore,
brethren, let us punish our own sins, if we seek the mercy of God. God cannot have mercy
on all men working iniquity as if pandering to sins, or not rooting out sins. In a word, either
thou punishest, or He punisheth.…
13. But let us see now another way in which this sentence may be understood. There is
a certain iniquity, on the worker whereof it cannot be that God have mercy. Ye enquire,
perchance, what that is? It is the defending of sins. When a man defendeth his sins, great
iniquity he worketh: that thing he is defending which God hateth. And see how perversely,
how iniquitously. Whatever of good he hath done, to himself he would have it to be ascribed;
whatever of evil, to God. For in this manner men defend sins in the person of God, which
is a worse sin.…Therefore thou defendest thy sin in such sort, that thou layest blame on
God. So the guilty is excused, so that the Judge may be charged. However on men working
iniquity God hath no pity at all.
14. “Let them be converted at the evening” (ver. 6). Of certain men he is speaking that
were once workers of iniquity, and once darkness, being converted in the evening. What is,
“in the evening”? Afterward. What is “at the evening”? Later. For before, before that they
crucified Christ, they ought to have acknowledged their Physician. Wherefore, when He
had been crucified—rising again, into Heaven ascending—after that He sent His Holy
Spirit, wherewith were fulfilled they that were in one house, and they began to speak with
the tongues of all nations, there feared the crucifiers of Christ; they were pricked through
with their consciences, they besought counsel of safety from the Apostles, they heard, “Repent,
and be baptized each one of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and your sins shall
be remitted unto you.”2250 After the slaying of Christ, after the shedding of the blood of
Christ, remitted are your sins.…“Let these be converted,” therefore, they also “at evening.”
Let them yearn for the grace of God, perceive themselves to be sinners; let those strong men
be made weak, those rich men be made poor, those just men acknowledge themselves sinners,
2249 1 Tim. i. 13.
2250 Acts ii. 38.
Part 1
those lions be made dogs. “Let them be converted at evening, and suffer hunger as dogs.
And they shall go around the city.” What city? That world, which in certain places the
Scripture calleth “the city of standing round:”2251 that is, because in all nations everywhere
the world had encompassed the one nation of Jews, where such words were being spoken,
and it was called “the city of standing round.” Around this city shall go those men, now
having become hungry dogs. In what manner shall they go around? By preaching. Saul out
of a wolf was made a dog at evening, that is, being late converted by the crumbs of his Lord,
in His grace he ran, and went around the city. 2252
15. “Behold, themselves shall speak in their mouth, and a sword is on the lips of them”
(ver. 7). Here is that sword twice whetted, whereof the Apostle saith, “And the sword of the
Spirit, which is the Word of God.”2253 Wherefore twice whetted? Wherefore, but because
smiting out of both Testaments? With this sword were slain those whereof it was said to
Peter, “Slay, and eat.”2254 “And a sword is on the lips of them. For who hath heard?” They
all speak in their mouth, “Who hath heard?” That is, they shall be wroth with men that are
slow to believe. They that a little before were even themselves unwilling to believe, do feel
disgust from men not believing. And truly, brethren, so it is. Thou seest a man slow before
he is made a Christian; thou criest to him daily, hardly he is converted: suppose him to be
converted, and then he would have all men to be Christians, and wondereth that not yet
they are. It hath chanced out to him at evening to have been converted: but because he hath
been made hungering like a dog, he hath also on his lips a sword; he saith, “Who hath heard?”
What is, “Who hath heard?” “Who hath believed our hearing, and to whom hath the arm
of the Lord been revealed?”2255 “For who hath heard?” The Jews believe not: they have
turned them to the nations, and have preached. The Jews did not believe; and nevertheless
through believing Jews the Gospel went around the city, and they said, “For who hath heard?”
“And Thou, Lord, shall deride them” (ver. 8). All nations are to be Christian, and ye say,
“Who hath heard?” What is, “shall deride them”? “As nothing Thou shalt esteem all nations.”
Nothing for Thee it shall be; because a most easy thing it will be for all nations to believe in
Thee.
16. “My strength to Thee I will keep” (ver. 9). For those strong men have fallen for this
reason; because their strength to Thee they have not kept: that is, they that upon me have
risen up and rushed, on themselves have relied. But I “my strength to Thee will keep:” because
if I withdraw, I fall; if I draw near, stronger I am made. For see, brethren, what there is in a
2251 E.V. “strong city.” Ps. xxxi. 21, lx. 9, cviii. 10.

human soul. It hath not of itself light, hath not of itself powers: but all that is fair in a soul,
is virtue and wisdom: but it neither is wise for itself, nor strong for itself, nor itself is light
to itself, nor itself is virtue to itself. There is a certain origin and fountain of virtue, there is
a certain root of wisdom, there is a certain, so to speak, if this also must be said, region of
unchangeable truth: from this the soul withdrawing is made dark, drawing near is made
light. 2256 “Draw near to Him, and be made light:” because by withdrawing ye are made
dark. Therefore, “my strength, I will keep to Thee:” not from Thee will I withdraw, not on
myself will I rely. “My strength, to Thee I will keep: because, O God, my lifter up2257 Thou
art.” For where was I, and where am I? Whence hast Thou taken me up? What iniquities of
mine hast Thou remitted? Where was I lying? To what have I been raised up? I ought to
have remembered these things: because in another Psalm is said, “For my father and my
mother have forsaken me, but the Lord hath taken me unto Him.”2258
17. “My God, the mercy of Him shall2259 come before me” (ver. 10). Behold what is,
“My strength, to Thee I will keep:” on myself I will in no ways at all rely. For what good
thing have I brought, that thou shouldest have mercy on me, and shouldest justify me? What
in me hast Thou found, save sins alone? Of Thine there is nothing else but the nature which
Thou hast created: the other things are mine own evil things which Thou hast blotted out.
I have not first risen up to Thee, but to awake me Thou hast come: for “His mercy shall
come before me.” Before that anything of good I shall do, “His mercy shall come before
me.” What answer here shall the unhappy Pelagius make? “My God hath shown to me
among mine enemies” (ver. 11). How great mercy He hath put forth concerning me, among
mine enemies He hath showed. Let one gathered compare himself with men forsaken, and
one elect with men rejected: let the vessel of mercy compare itself with the vessels of wrath;
and let it see how out of one lump God hath made one vessel unto honour, another unto
dishonour.
“For so God, willing to show wrath, and to manifest His power, hath brought in, in
much patience, the vessels of wrath, which have been perfected unto perdition.”2260 And
wherefore this? “In order that He might make known His riches upon the vessels of mercy.”
If therefore vessels of wrath He hath brought in, wherein He might make known His riches
upon the vessels of mercy, most rightly hath been said, “His mercy shall come before me:
My God hath showed to me among mine enemies:” that is however great mercy He hath
had concerning me, to me He hath showed it among these men concerning whom He hath

not had mercy. For unless the debtor be in suspense, he is less grateful to him by whom the
debt hath been forgiven. “My God hath showed to me among mine enemies.”
18. But of the enemies themselves what? “Slay them not, lest sometime they forget Thy
law.” He is making request for his enemies, he is fulfilling the commandment.…Slay not
them of whom the sins Thou slayest. But what is it to be slain? To forget the law of the Lord.
It is real death, to go into the pit of sin; this indeed may be also understood of the Jews. Why
of the Jews, “Slay not them, lest sometime they forget Thy law”? Those very enemies of mine,
that have slain me, do not Thou slay. Let the nation of the Jews remain: certes conquered it
hath been by the Romans, certes effaced is the city of them, Jews are not admitted into their
city, and yet Jews there are. For all those provinces by the Romans have been subjugated.
Who now can distinguish the nations in the Roman empire the one from the other, inasmuch
as all have become Romans and all are called Romans? The Jews nevertheless remain with
a mark; nor in such sort conquered have they been, as that by the conquerors they have
been swallowed up. Not without reason is there that Cain, on whom, when he had slain his
brother, God set a mark in order that no one should slay him.2261 This is the mark which
the Jews have: they hold fast by the remnant of their law, they are circumcised, they keep
Sabbaths, they sacrifice the Passover; they eat unleavened bread. These are therefore Jews,
they have not been slain, they are necessary to believing nations. Why so? In order that He
may show to us among our enemies His mercy. “My God hath shown to me in mine enemies.”
He showeth His mercy to the wild-olive grafted on branches that have been cut off because
of pride. Behold where they lie, that were proud, behold where thou hast been grafted, that
didst lie: and be not thou proud, lest thou shouldest deserve to be cut off.
19. “Scatter them abroad in Thy virtue” (ver. 11). Now this thing hath been done:
throughout all nations there have been scattered abroad the Jews, witnesses of their own
iniquity and our truth. They have themselves writings, out of which hath been prophesied
Christ, and we hold Christ. And if sometime perchance any heathen man shall have doubted,
when we have told him the prophecies of Christ, at the clearness whereof he is amazed, and
wondering hath supposed that they were written by ourselves, then out of the copies of the
Jews we prove, how this thing so long time before had been foretold. See after what sort by
means of our enemies we confound other enemies. “Scatter them abroad in Thy virtue:”
take away from them “virtue,” take away from them their strength. “And bring them down,
my protector, O Lord.” “The transgressions of their mouth, the discourse of their lips: and
let them be taken in their pride: and out of cursing and lying shall be declared consumma-
tions, in the anger of consummation, and they shall not be” (ver. 12). Obscure words these
are, and I fear lest they be not well instilled.…
2261 Gen. iv. 15.
Part 1
The Second Part.
1. For, behold, the Jews are enemies, whom this Psalm seemeth to imply; the law of God
they hold, and therefore of them hath been said, “Slay not them, lest sometime they forget
Thy law:” in order that the nation of Jews might remain, and by it remaining the number
of Christians might increase. Throughout all nations they remain certainly, and Jews they
are, nor have they ceased to be what they were: that is, this nation hath not so yielded to
Roman institutions, as to have lost the form of Jews; but hath been subjected to the Romans
so as that it still retaineth its own laws; which are the laws of God. But what in their case
hath been done? “Ye tithe mint and cummin, and have forsaken the weightier matters of
the law, mercy, and judgment, straining a gnat, but swallowing a camel.”2262 This to them
the Lord saith. And in truth so they are; they hold the law, hold the Prophets; read all things,
sing all things: the light of the Prophets therein they see not, which is Christ Jesus. Not only
Him now they see not, when he is sitting in Heaven: but not even at that time saw they Him,
when among them humble He was walking, and they were made guilty by shedding the
blood of the Same; but not all. This even to-day we commend to the notice of your Love.
Not all: because many of them were turned to Him whom they slew, and by believing on
Him, they obtained pardon even for the shedding of His blood: and they have given an ex-
ample for men; how they ought not to despair that sin of whatsoever kind would be remitted
to them, since even the killing of Christ was remitted to them confessing.…
2. What in them wilt Thou slay? The Crucify, Crucify,2263 which they cried out, not
them that cried out. For they willed to blot out, cut off, destroy Christ: but Thou, by raising
to life Christ, whom they willed to destroy, dost slay the “transgressions of their mouth, the
discourse of their lips.” For in that He whom they cried out should be destroyed, liveth, they
are taken with dread: and that He whom on earth they despised, in heaven is adored by all
nations, they wonder: thus are there slain the transgressions of them, and the discourse of
their lips. What is, “let them be taken in their pride”? Because to no purpose have strong
men rushed on, and it hath fallen out to them as it were to think themselves to have done
somewhat, and they have prevailed against the Lord. They were able to crucify a man,
weakness might prevail and virtue2264 be slain; and they thought themselves somewhat, as
it were strong men, as it were mighty men, as it were prevailing, as it were a lion prepared
for prey, as it were fat bulls, as of them in another place he maketh mention: “Fat bulls have
beset me.”2265 But what have they done in the case of Christ? Not life, but death they have
slain.…And what now hath come to pass in those men that have been converted? For it was

told to them that He whom they slew rose again. They believed Him to have risen again,
because they saw that He, being in Heaven, thence sent the Holy Spirit, and filled those that
on Him believed; and they found themselves to have condemned nought, and to have done
nought. Their doing issued in emptiness, the sin remained. Because therefore the doing was
made void, but the sin remained upon the doers; they were taken in their pride, they saw
themselves under their iniquity.2266 It remained therefore for them to confess the sin, and
for Him to pardon, that had given Himself up to sinners, and to forgive His death, having
been slain by men dead, and making alive men dead. They were taken therefore in their
pride.
3. “And out of cursing and lying shall be declared consummations, in anger of consum-
mation, and they shall not be.” This too with difficulty is understood, to what is joined the
“and they shall not be.” What shall they not be? Let us therefore examine the context above:
when they shall have been taken in their pride, “there shall be declared out of cursing and
lying consummations.” What are consummations? Perfections: for to be consummated, is
to be perfected. One thing it is to be consummated, another thing to be consumed. For a
thing is consummated which is so finished as that it is perfected: a thing is consumed which
is so finished that it is not. Pride would not suffer a man to be perfected, nothing so much
hindereth perfection. For let your Love attend a little to what I am saying; and see an evil
very pernicious, very much to be guarded against. What sort of evil do ye think it is? How
long could I enlarge upon how much evil there is in pride? The devil on that account alone
is to be punished. Certes he is the chief of all sinners: certes he is the tempter to sin: to him
is not ascribed adultery, not wine-bibbing, not fornication, not the robbing of others’ goods:
by pride alone he fell. And since pride’s companion is envy, it must needs be that a proud
man should envy.…In a word, all vices in evil-doings are to be feared, pride in well-doings
is more to be feared. It is no wonder, then, that so humble is the Apostle, as to say, “When
I am made weak, then I am strong.”2267 For lest he should himself be tempted by this sin,
what sort of medicine doth he say was applied to him against swelling by the Physician, who
knew what He was healing? “Lest by the greatness,” he saith, “of the revelations I should be
exalted, there was given to me a thorn of my flesh, the angel of Satan, to buffet me: wherefore
thrice the Lord I besought, that it should depart from me: and He said to me, My grace is
sufficient for thee, for virtue in weakness is made perfect.”2268 See what the consummations
are. An Apostle, the teacher of Gentiles, father of the faithful through the Gospel, received
a thorn of the flesh whereby he might be buffeted. Which of us would dare to say this, unless
he had not been ashamed to confess this? For if we shall have said that Paul had not suffered
2266 Acts i. 9, ii. 4, 37.
2267 2 Cor. xii. 10.
2268 2 Cor. xii. 7–9.
Part 2
this; while to him as it were honour we give, a liar we make him. But because truthful he is,
and truth he hath spoken; it behoveth us to believe that there was given to him an angel of
Satan, lest by the greatness of the revelations he should be exalted. Behold how much to be
feared is the serpent of pride.…
4. What is, “in the anger of consummation shall be declared consummations”? There
is an anger of consummation, and there is an anger of consuming. For every vengeance of
God is called anger: sometimes God avengeth, to the end that He may make perfect; some-
times He avengeth, to the end that He may condemn. How doth He avenge, to the end that
He may make perfect? “He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”2269 How doth He
avenge, to the end that He may condemn? When He shall have set ungodly men on the left
hand, and shall have said to them, “Go ye into fire everlasting, that hath been prepared for
the devil and his angels.”2270 This is the anger of consuming, not that of consummation.
But “there shall be declared consummations in the anger of consummation;” it shall be
preached by the Apostles, that “where sin hath abounded, grace shall much more
abound,”2271 and the weakness of man hath belonged to the healing of humility. Those men
thinking of this, and finding out and confessing their iniquities, “shall not be.” “Shall not
be” what? In their pride.
5. “And they shall know how God shall have dominion of Jacob, and of the ends of the
earth” (ver. 13). For before they thought themselves just men, because the Jewish nation
had received the Law, because it had kept the commandments of God: it is proved to them
that it hath not kept them, since in the very commandments of God Christ it perceived not,
because “blindness in part has happened to Israel.” 2272 Even the Jews themselves see that
they ought not to despise the Gentiles, of whom they deemed as of dogs and sinners. For
just as alike they have been found in iniquity, so alike they will attain unto salvation. “Not
only to Jews,” saith the Apostle, “but also even to Gentiles.”2273 For to this end the Stone
which the builders set at nought, hath even been made for the Head of the corner,2274 in
order that two in itself It might join: for a corner doth unite two walls. The Jews thought
themselves exalted and great: of the Gentiles they thought as weak, as sinners, as the servants
of demons, as the worshippers of idols, and yet in both was there iniquity. Even the Jews
have been proved sinners; because “there is none that doeth good, there is not even so much
as one:”2275 they have laid down their pride, and have not envied the salvation of the Gentiles,

because they have known their own and their weakness to be alike: and in the Corner Stone
being united, they have together worshipped the Lord.…
6. “They shall be converted at evening” (ver. 14): that is, even if late, that is, after the
slaying of our Lord Jesus Christ: “They shall be converted at evening: and hereafter they
shall suffer hunger as dogs.” But “as dogs,” not as sheep or calves: “as dogs,” as Gentiles, as
sinners; because they too have known their sin that thought themselves righteous.…It is a
good thing therefore for a sinner to be humbled; and no one is more incurable than he that
thinketh himself whole. “And they shall go around the city.” Already we have explained
“city;”2276 it is the “city of standing round;” all nations.
7. “They shall be scattered abroad in order that they may eat” (ver. 15); that is, in order
that they may gain others, in order that into their Body they may change believers. “But if
they shall not be filled, they shall murmur.” Because above also he had spoken of the murmur
of them, saying, “For who hath heard?” “And Thou, O Lord,” he saith, “shall deride them,
saying, Who hath heard?”2277 Wherefore? Because, as nothing Thou shall count all nations.
Let the Psalm be concluded. See ye the Corner2278 exulting, now with both walls rejoicing.
The Jews were proud, humbled they have been; Gentiles were despairing, raised up they
have been: let them come to the Corner, there let them meet, there run together, there find
the kiss of peace; from different parts let them come, but with differing not come, those of
Circumcision, these of uncircumcision. Far apart were the walls, but before that to the
Corner they came: but in the Corner let them hold themselves, and now let the whole Church
from both walls, say what? “But I will sing of Thy power, and I will exult in the morning of
Thy mercy” (ver. 16). In the morning when temptations have been overcome, in the
morning when the night of this world shall have passed away; in the morning when no
longer the lyings in wait of robbers and of the devil and of his angels we dread, in the
morning when no longer by the lamp of prophecy we walk, but Himself the Word of God
as it were a Sun we contemplate. “And I will exult in the morning of Thy mercy.” With
reason in another Psalm is said, “In the morning I will stand by Thee, and I will meditate.”2279
With reason also of the Lord Himself the Resurrection was at dawn, that there should be
fulfilled that which hath been said in another Psalm, “In the evening shall tarry weeping
and in the morning exultation.”2280 For at even the disciples mourned our Lord Jesus Christ
as dead, at dawn at Him rising again they exulted. “For Thou hast become my taker up, and
my refuge in the day of my tribulation.”

8. “My Helper, to Thee I will play, because Thou, O God, art my taker up” (ver. 17).
What was I, unless Thou didst succour? How much despaired of was I, unless Thou didst
heal? Where was I lying, unless Thou didst come to me? Certes with a huge wound I was
endangered, but that wound of mine did call for an Almighty Physician. To an Almighty
Physician nothing is incurable.…Lastly, thinking of all good things whatsoever we may
have, either in nature or in purpose, or in conversion itself, in faith, in hope, in charity, in
good morals, in justice, in fear of God; all these to be only by His gifts, he hath thus concluded:
“My God is my mercy:” He being filled with the good things of God hath not found what
he might call his God, save “his mercy.” O name, under which no one must despair! If thou
say, my salvation, I perceive that He giveth salvation; if thou say, my refuge, I perceive that
thou takest refuge in Him; if thou say, my strength, I perceive that He giveth to thee strength:
“my mercy,” is what? All that I am is of Thy mercy.…

Psalm LX.2281
1. David the king was one man, but not one man he figured; sometimes to wit he figured
the Church of many men consisting, extended even unto the ends of the earth: but sometimes
One Man he figured, Him he figured that is Mediator of God and men, the Man Christ Je-
sus.2282 In this Psalm therefore, or rather in this Psalm’s title, certain victorious actions of
David are spoken of:…“To the end, in behalf of those men that shall be changed unto the
title’s inscription, unto teaching for David himself, when he burned up Mesopotamia in
Syria, and Syria Sobal, and turned Joab, and smote Edom, in the valley of salt-pits twelve
thousand.” We read of these things in the books of the Reigns,2283 that all those persons
whom he hath named, were defeated by David, that is, Mesopotamia in Syria, and Syria
Sobal, Joab,2284 Edom. These things were done, and just as they were done, so there they
have been written, so they are read: let him read that will. Nevertheless, as the Prophetic
Spirit in the Psalms’ titles is wont to depart somewhat from the expression of things done,
and to say something which in history is not found, and hence rather to admonish us that
titles of this kind have been written not that we may know things done, but that things future
may be prefigured.…But here this thing is inserted for this especial reason, that there it is
not written2285 that he burned up Mesopotamia in Syria, and Syria Sobal. But now let us
begin to examine these things after the significations of things future, and to bring out the
dimness of shadows into the light of the word.
2. What is “to the end” ye know. For “the end of the law is Christ.”2286 Those that are
changed ye know. For who but they that do pass from old life into new?…“For ye were
sometime darkness, but now light in the Lord.”2287 But they are changed “into the title’s
inscription,”…who into the kingdom of Christ do pass over from the kingdom of the devil.
It is well that they are changed unto this title’s inscription. But they are changed, as followeth,
“unto teaching.” He added, “for David himself unto teaching:” that is, are changed not for
themselves, but for David himself, and are changed unto teaching.…When therefore would
Christ have changed us, unless He had done that which He spake of, “Fire I have come to
send into the world”?2288 If therefore Christ came to send into the world fire, to wit to its
2281 Lat. LIX. Sermon preached to the people a little while after the exposition of the former Psalm.

some conquered nation.

health and profit, we must inquire not how He is to send the world into fire, but how into
the world fire. Inasmuch as therefore He came to send fire into the world, let us inquire
what is Mesopotamia which was burned up, what is Syria Sobal? The interpretations therefore
of the names let us examine according to the Hebrew language, wherein first this Scripture
was written. Mesopotamia 2289 they say is interpreted, “exalted calling.” Now the whole
world by calling hath been exalted, Syria2290 is interpreted “lofty.” But she which was lofty,
burned up hath been and humbled. Sobal is interpreted “empty antiquity.” Thanks to Christ
that hath burned her. Whenever old bushes are burned up, green places succeed; and more
speedily and more plentifully, and more fully green, fresh ones spring out, when fire hath
gone before them to the burning up of the old. Let not therefore the fire of Christ be feared,
hay it consumeth. “For all flesh is hay, and all the glory of man as flower of hay.”2291 He
burneth up therefore those things with that fire. “And turned Joab.” Joab is interpreted en-
emy. There was turned an enemy, as thou wilt understand it. If turned unto flight, the devil
it is: if converted to the faith, a Christian it is. How unto flight? From the heart of a Christian:
“The Prince of this world,” He saith, “now hath been cast out.”2292 But how can a Christian
turned to the Lord be an enemy turned? Because he hath become a believer that had been
an enemy. “Smote Edom.” Edom is interpreted “earthly.” That earthly one ought to be
smitten. For why should one live earthly, that ought to live heavenly? There hath been slain
therefore life earthly, let there live life heavenly. “For as we have borne the image of the
earthly, let us bear also the image of Him that is from Heaven.” 2293 See it slain: “Mortify
your members which are upon earth.”2294 But when he had smitten Edom, he smote “twelve
thousand in the valley of salt-pits.” Twelve thousand is a perfect number, to which perfect
number also the number of the twelve Apostles is ascribed: for not to no purpose is it, but
because through the whole world was to be sent the Word. But the Word2295 of God, which
is Christ, is in clouds, that is, in the preachers of truth. But the world of four parts doth
consist. The four parts thereof are exceeding well known to all, and often in the Scriptures
they are mentioned: they are the same as the name of the four winds, East, West, North,
and South. To all these four parts was sent the Word, so that in the Trinity all might be
called. The number twelve four times three do make. With reason therefore twelve thousand
2296 earthly things were smitten, the whole world was smitten: for from the whole world

was chosen out the Church, mortified from earthly life. Why “in the valley of salt-pits”? A
valley is humility: salt-pits signify savour. For many men are humbled, but emptily and
foolishly, in empty oldness they are humbled. One suffereth tribulation for money, suffereth
tribulation for temporal honour, suffereth tribulation for the comforts of this life; he is to
suffer tribulation and to be humbled: why not for the sake of God? why not for the sake of
Christ? why not for the savour of salt? Knowest thou not that to thee hath been said, “Ye
are the salt of earth,” and, “If the salt shall have been spoiled, for no other thing will it be of
use, but to be cast out”?2297 A good thing it is therefore wisely to be humbled. Behold now
are not heretics being humbled? Have not laws been made even by men to condemn them,
against whom divine laws do reign, which even before had condemned them? Behold they
are humbled, behold they are put to flight, behold persecution they suffer, but without savour;
for folly, for emptiness. For now the salt hath been spoiled: therefore it hath been cast out,
to be trodden down of men. We have heard the title of the Psalm, let us hear also the words
of the Psalm.
3. “God, Thou hast driven us back, and hast destroyed us” (ver. 1). Is that David
speaking that smote, that burned up, that defeated, and not they to whom He did these
things, that is to say, their being smitten and driven back, that were evil men, and again
their being made alive and returning in order that they might be good men? That destruction
indeed that David made, strong of hand, our Christ, whose figure that man was bearing; He
did those things, He made this destruction with His sword and with His fire: for both He
brought into this world. Both “Fire I am come to send into the world,”2298 thou hast in the
Gospel: and “A sword I have come to send into the earth,”2299 thou hast in the Gospel. He
brought in fire, whereby might be burned up Mesopotamia in Syria, and Syria Sobal: He
brought in a sword whereby might be smitten Edom. Now again this destruction was made
for the sake of “those that are changed unto the title’s inscription.” Hear we therefore the
voice of them: to their health smitten they were, being raised up let them speak. Let them
say, therefore, that are changed into something better, changed unto the title’s inscription,
changed unto teaching for David himself; let them say, “Thou hast had mercy upon us.”
Thou hast destroyed us, in order that Thou mightest build us; Thou hast destroyed us that
were ill builded, hast destroyed empty oldness; in order that there may be a building unto
a new man, building to abide for everlasting.…
4. “Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it” (ver. 2). How hath the earth been
troubled? In the conscience of sinners. Whither go we? Whither flee we, when this sword
hath been brandished, “Repent, for near hath drawn the kingdom of Heaven”?2300 “Heal

the crushings2301 thereof, for moved it hath been.” Unworthy it is to be healed, if moved it
hath not been: but thou speakest, preachest, threatenest us with God, of coming judgment
holdest not thy peace, of the commandment of God thou warnest, from these things thou
abstainest not; and he that heareth, if he feareth not, if he is not moved, is not worthy to be
healed. Another heareth, is moved, is stung, smiteth the breast, sheddeth tears.…
5. The first labour is, that thou shouldest be displeasing to thyself, that sins thou
shouldest battle out, that thou shouldest be changed into something better: the second labour,
in return for thy having been changed, is to bear the tribulations and temptations of this
world, and amid them to hold on even unto the end. Of these things therefore when he was
speaking, while pointing out such things, he addeth what? “Thou hast shown to Thy people
hard things” (ver. 3): to Thy people now, made tributary after the victory of David. “Thou
hast shown to Thy people hard things.” Wherein? In persecutions which the Church of
Christ hath endured, when so much blood of martyrs was spilled. “Thou hast given us to
drink of the wine of goading.” “Of goading” is what? Not of killing. For it was not a killing
that destroyeth, but a medicine that smarteth. 2302 “Thou hast given us to drink of the wine
of goading.”
6. Wherefore this? “Thou hast given to men fearing Thee, a sign that they should flee
from the face of the bow” (ver. 4). Through tribulations temporal, he saith, Thou hast signified
to Thine own to flee from the wrath of fire everlasting. For, saith the Apostle Peter, “Time
it is that Judgment begin with the House of God.”2303 And exhorting the Martyrs to endur-
ance, when the world should rage, when slaughters should be made at the hands of perse-
cutors, when far and wide blood of believers should be spilled, when in chains, in prisons,
in tortures, many hard things Christians should suffer, in these hard things, I say, lest they
should faint, Peter saith to them, “Time it is that Judgment begin with the House of God,”
etc.2304 What therefore is to be in the Judgment? The bow is bended, still in menacing
posture it is, not yet in aiming. And see what there is in the bow: is there not an arrow to be
shot forward? The string however is stretched back in a contrary direction to that in which
it is going to be shot; and the more the stretching thereof hath gone backward, with the
greater swiftness it starteth forward. What is it that I have said? The more the Judgment is
deferred, with so much the greater swiftness it is to come. Therefore even for temporal
tribulations to God let us render thanks, because He hath given to His people a sign, “that
they should flee from the face of the bow:” in order that His faithful ones having been exer-

cised in tribulations temporal, may be worthy to avoid the condemnation of fire everlasting,
which is to find out all them that do not believe these things.
7. “That Thy beloved may be delivered: save me with Thy right hand, and hearken unto
me” (ver. 5). With Thy right hand save me, Lord: so save me as that at the right hand I may
stand. Not any safety temporal I require, in this matter Thy Will be done. For a time what
is good for us we are utterly ignorant: for “what we should pray for as we ought we know
not:”2305 but “save me with Thy right hand,” so that even if in this time I suffer sundry
tribulations, when the night of all tribulations hath been spent, on the right hand I may be
found among the sheep, not on the left hand among the goats.2306 “And hearken unto me.”
Because now I am deserving that which Thou art willing to give; not “with the words of my
transgressions” I am crying through the day, so that Thou hearken not, and “in the night
so that Thou hearken not,”2307 and that not for folly to me,” but truly for my warning, by
adding savour from the valley of salt-pits, so that in tribulation I may know what to ask: but
I ask life everlasting; therefore hearken unto me, because Thy right hand I ask.…
8. “God hath spoken in His Holy One” (ver. 6).…In what Holy One of His? “God was
in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.”2308 In that Holy One, of whom elsewhere ye
have heard, “O God, in the Holy One is Thy way.”2309 “I will rejoice and will divide Sichi-
ma.…and the valley of tabernacles I will measure out.” Sichima is interpreted shoulders.
But according to history, Jacob returning from Laban his father-in-law with all his kindred,
hid the idols in Sichima2310 which he had from Syria, where for a long time he had dwelled,
and at length was coming from thence. But tabernacles he made there because of his sheep
and herds, and called the place Tabernacles.2311 And these I will divide, saith the Church.
What is this, “I will divide Sichima”? If to the story where the idols were hidden is the refer-
ence, the Gentiles it signifieth; I divide the Gentiles. I divide, is what? “For not in all men is
there faith.”2312 I divide, is what? Some will believe, others will not believe.…The shoulders
are divided, in order that their sins may burthen some men, while others may take up the
burden of Christ. For godly shoulders He was requiring when He said, “For My yoke is
gentle, and My burden is light.”2313 Another burden oppresseth and loadeth thee, but

Christ’s burden relieveth thee: another burden hath weight, Christ’s burden hath wings. For
even if thou pull off the wings from a bird, thou dost remove a kind of weight; and the more
weight thou hast taken away, the more on earth it will abide. She that thou hast chosen to
disburden lieth there: she flieth not, because thou hast taken off a weight: let there be given
back the weight, and she flieth. Such is Christ’s burden; let men carry it, and not be idle: let
them not be heeded that will not bear it; let them bear it that will, and they shall find how
light it is, how sweet, how pleasant, how ravishing unto Heaven, and from earth how
transporting.…Perchance because of the sheep of Jacob, “the valley of Tabernacles” is to be
understood of the nation of the Jews, and the same is divided: for they have passed from
thence that have believed, the rest have remained without.
9. “Mine is Galaad” (ver. 7). These names are read in the Scriptures of God. Galaad hath
the voice of an interpretation of its own and of a great Mystery: for it is interpreted “the
heap of testimony.” How great a heap of testimony in the Martyrs? “Mine is Galaad,” mine
is a heap of testimony, mine are the true Martyrs.…Then meanly esteemed was the Church
among men, then reproach on Her a Widow was being thrown, because Christ’s She was,
because the sign of the Cross on her brow She was wearing: not yet was there honour, censure
there was then: when therefore not honour, but censure there was, then was made a heap
of witness; and through the heap of witness was the Love of Christ enlarged; and through
the enlargement of the Love of Christ, were the Gentiles possessed. There followeth, “And
mine is Manasses;” which is interpreted forgotten. For to Her had been said, “Confusion
for everlasting Thou shalt forget, and of the reproach of Thy widowhood Thou shalt not be
mindful.”2314 There was therefore a confusion of the Church once, which now hath been
forgotten: for of Her confusion and of the “reproach” of Her widowhood now She is not
mindful. For when there was a sort of confusion among men, a heap of witness was made.
Now no longer doth any even remember that confusion, when it was a reproach to be a
Christian, now no one remembereth, now all have forgotten, now “Mine is Manasses, and
Ephraim the strength of My head.” Ephraim is interpreted fruitfulness. Mine, he saith, is
fruitfulness, and this fruitfulness is the strength of My Head. For My Head is Christ. And
whence is fruitfulness the strength of Him? Because unless a grain were to fall into the earth,
it would not be multiplied, alone it would remain.2315 Fall then to earth did Christ in His
Passion, and there followed fruit-bearing in the Resurrection. He was hanging and was being
despised: the grain was within, it had powers to draw after it all things. How in a grain do
numbers of seeds lie hid, something abject it appeareth to the eyes, but a power2316 turning
into itself matter and bringing forth fruit is hidden; so in Christ’s Cross virtue2317 was hidden,

there appeared weakness. O mighty grain! Doubtless weak is He that hangeth, Doubtless
before Him that people did wag the head, Doubtless they said, “If Son of God He is, let Him
come down from the Cross.”2318 Hear the strength of Him: that which is a weak thing of
God, is stronger than men.2319 With reason so great fruitfulness hath followed: it is mine,
saith the Church.
10. “Juda is my king: Moab the pot of my hope” (ver. 7). What Juda? He that is of the
tribe of Juda. What Juda, but He to whom Jacob himself said, “Juda, thy brethren shall praise
thee”?2320 What therefore should I fear, when Juda my king saith, “Fear not them that kill
the body”?2321 “Moab the pot of my hope.” Wherefore “pot”? Because tribulation. Wherefore
“of my hope”? Because there hath gone before Juda my king.…Moab is perceived in the
Gentiles. For that nation was born of sin,2322 that nation was born of the daughters of Lot,
who lay with their father drunken, abusing a father. Better were it to have remained barren,
than thus to have become mothers. But this was a kind of figure of them that abuse the law.
For do not heed that law in the Latin language is of the feminine gender: in Greek of the
masculine gender it is: but whether it be of the feminine gender in speaking, or of the mas-
culine, the expression maketh no difference to the truth. For law hath rather a masculine
force, because it ruleth, is not ruled. But moreover, the Apostle Paul saith what? “Good is
the law, if any one use it lawfully.”2323 But those daughters of Lot unlawfully used their
father. But in the same manner as good works begin to grow when a man useth well the law:
so arise evil works, when a man ill useth the law. Furthermore, they ill using their father,
that is, ill using the law, engendered the Moabites, by whom are signified evil works. Thence
the tribulation of the Church, thence the pot boiling up. Of this pot in a certain place of
prophecy is said, “A pot heated by the North wind.” 2324 Whence but by the quarters of the
devil, who hath said, “I will set my seat at the North”?2325 The chiefest tribulations therefore
arise against the Church from none except from those that ill use the law.…
11. “Into Idumæa I will stretch out my shoe” (ver. 8). The Church speaketh, “I will come
through even unto Idumæa.” Let tribulations rage, let the world boil with offences, even
unto those very persons that lead an earthly life (for Idumæa is interpreted earthly), even
unto those same, “even unto Idumæa, I will stretch out my shoe.” Of what thing the shoe

except of the Gospel? “How beautiful the feet of them that tell of peace, that tell of good
things,”2326 and “the feet shod unto the preparation of the Gospel of peace.”2327…In these
times we see, brethren, how many earthly men do perpetrate frauds for the sake of gain, for
frauds perjuries; on account of their fears they consult fortune-tellers, astrologers: all these
men are Edomites, earthly; and nevertheless all these men adore Christ, under His own shoe
they are; now even unto Idumæa is stretched out His shoe. “To Me Allophyli have been
made subject.” Who are “Allophyli”? Men of other race, not belonging to My race. 2328 They
“have been made subject,” because many men adore Christ, and are not to reign with Christ.
12. “Who will lead Me down into the city of standing round?” (ver. 9). What is the city
of standing round? If ye remember already, I have made mention thereof in another
Psalm,2329 wherein hath been said, “And they shall go around the city.” For the city of
standing round is the compassing around of the Gentiles, which compassing around of the
Gentiles in the middle thereof had the one nation of the Jews, worshipping one God: the
rest of the compassing around of the Gentiles to idols made supplication, demons they did
serve. And mystically it was called the city of standing round; because on all sides the Gentiles
had poured themselves around, and had stood around that nation which did worship one
God.…“Who will lead me down even unto Idumæa?”
13. “Wilt not Thou, O God, that hast driven us back? And wilt not Thou, O God, march
forth in our powers?” (ver. 10). Wilt not Thou lead us down, that hast driven us back? But
wherefore “hast driven us back”? Because Thou hast destroyed us.2330 Wherefore hast des-
troyed us? Because angry Thou hast been, and hast had pity on us. Thou therefore wilt lead
down, that hast driven back; Thou, O God, that wilt not march forth in our powers, wilt
lead down. What is, “wilt not march forth in our powers”? The world is to rage, the world
is to tread us down, there is to be a heap of witnesses, builded of the spilled blood of martyrs,
and the raging heathen are to say, “Where is the God of them?” 2331 Then “Thou wilt not
march forth in our powers:” against them Thou wilt not show Thyself, Thou wilt not show
Thy power, such as Thou hast shown in David, in Moses, in Joshua the son of Nun, when
to their might the Gentiles yielded, and when the slaughter had been ended, and the great
laying waste repaired, into the land which Thou promisedst Thou leddest in Thy people.
This thing then Thou wilt not do, “Thou wilt not march forth in our powers,” but within
Thou wilt work. What is, “wilt not march forth”? Wilt not show Thyself. For indeed when

in chains the Martyrs were being led along, when they were being shut up in prison, when
they were being led forth to be mocked, when to the beasts they were exposed,2332 when
they were being smitten with the sword, when with fire they were being burned, were they
not despised as though forsaken, as though without helper? In what manner was God
working within? in what manner within was He comforting? in what manner to these men
was He making sweet the hope of life everlasting? in what manner was He not forsaking the
hearts of them, where the man was dwelling2333 in silence, well if good, ill if evil? Was He
then by any means forsaking, because He was not marching forth in the powers2334 of them?
By not marching forth in the powers of them, did He not the more lead down the Church
even unto Idumæa, lead down the Church even unto the city of standing around? For if the
Church chose to war and to use the sword, She would seem to be fighting for life present:
but because she was despising life present, therefore there was made a heap of witness for
the life that shall be.
14. Thou therefore, O God, that wilt not march forth in our powers, “Give to us aid
from tribulation, and vain is the safety of man” (ver. 11). Go now they that salt have not,
and desire safety temporal for their friends, which is empty oldness. “Give to us aid:” from
thence whence Thou wast supposed to forsake, thence succour. “In God we will do valour,2335
and Himself to nothing shall bring down our enemies” (ver. 12). We will not do valour with
the sword, not with horses, not with breastplates, not with shields, not in the mightiness of
an army, not abroad. But where? Within, where we are not seen. Where within? “In God
we will do virtue:” and as if abjects, and as if trodden down, men as if of no consideration
we shall be, but “Himself to nothing shall bring down our enemies.” In a word, this thing
hath been done to our enemies. Trodden down have been the Martyrs: by suffering, by en-
during, by persevering even unto the end, in God they have done valour. Himself also hath
done that which followeth: to nothing He hath brought down the enemies of them. Where
are now the enemies of the Martyrs, except perchance that now drunken men with their
cups do persecute those whom at that time frenzied men did use with stones to persecute?

Psalm LX
Psalm LXI.2336
1. The title of it doth not detain us. For it is “Unto the end, in hymns, to David himself.
“In hymns,” to wit in praises. “Unto the end,” to wit unto Christ.…But the voice in this
Psalm (if we are among the members of Him, and in the Body, even as upon His exhortation
we have the boldness to trust) we ought to acknowledge to be our own, not that of any for-
eigner. But I have not so called it our own, as if it were of those only that are now in presence;
but our own, as being of us that are throughout the whole world, that are from the East even
unto the West. And in order that ye may know it thus to be our voice, He speaketh here as
if one Man: but He is not One Man; but even as One, the Unity is speaking. But in Christ
we all are one man: because of this One Man the Head is in Heaven, and the members are
yet toiling on earth: and because they are toiling see what He saith.2337
2. “Hearken, O God, to my supplication, give heed to my prayer” (ver. 1). Who saith?
He, as if One. See whether one: “From the ends of the earth to Thee I have cried, while my
heart was being vexed” (ver. 2). Now therefore not one: but for this reason one, because
Christ is One, of whom all we are the members. For what one man crieth from the ends of
the earth? There crieth not from the ends of the earth any but that inheritance, of which
hath been said to the Son Himself, “Demand of Me, and I will give to Thee the nations for
Thine inheritance, and for Thy possession the boundaries of the earth.”2338 This therefore
Christ’s possession, this Christ’s inheritance, this Christ’s Body, this Christ’s one Church,
this the Unity which we are, is crying from the ends of the earth.…But wherefore have I
cried this thing? “While my heart was being vexed.” He showeth himself to be throughout
all nations in the whole round world, in great glory, but in great tribulation. For our life in
this sojourning cannot be without temptation: because our advance is made through our
temptation, nor does a man become known to himself unless tempted, nor can he be crowned
except he shall have conquered, nor can he conquer except he shall have striven, nor can
he strive except he shall have experienced an enemy, and temptations. This Man therefore
is being vexed, that from the ends of the earth is crying, but nevertheless He is not forsaken.
For ourselves who are His Body He hath willed to prefigure also in that His Body wherein
already He hath both died and hath risen again, and into Heaven hath ascended, in order
that whither the Head hath gone before, thither the members may be assured that they shall
follow. Therefore us He did transfer by a figure into Himself, when He willed to be tempted
of Satan.

was being tempted of the devil.2339 Christ entirely was tempted of the devil. For in Christ

Psalm LXI
thou wast being tempted, because Christ of thee had for Himself flesh, of Himself for thee
salvation; of thee for Himself death, of Himself for thee life; of thee for Himself revilings,
of Himself for thee honours; therefore of thee for Himself temptation, of Himself for thee
victory. If in Him tempted we have been, in Him we overcome the devil.…“On the Rock
Thou hast exalted me.” Now therefore here we perceive who is crying from the ends of the
earth. Let us call to mind the Gospel: “Upon this Rock I will build My Church.”2340 Therefore
She crieth from the ends of the earth, whom He hath willed to be builded upon a Rock. But
in order that the Church might be builded upon the Rock, who was made the Rock? Hear
Paul saying: “But the Rock was Christ.”2341 On Him therefore builded we have been. For
this reason that Rock whereon we have been builded,2342 first hath been smitten with winds,
flood, rain, when Christ of the devil was being tempted. Behold on what firmness He hath
willed to stablish thee. With reason our voice is not in vain, but is hearkened unto: for on
great hope we have been set: “On the Rock Thou hast exalted me.”…
4. “Thou hast led me down, because Thou hast been made my hope: a tower of strength
from the face of the enemy” (ver. 3). My heart is vexed, saith that Unity from the ends of
the earth, and I toil amid temptations and offences: the heathen envy, because they have
been conquered; the heretics lie in wait, hidden in the cloak of the Christian name: within
in the Church itself the wheat suffereth violence from the chaff: amid all these things when
my heart is vexed, I will cry from the ends of the earth. But there forsaketh me not the Same
that hath exalted me upon the Rock, in order to lead me down even unto Himself, because
even if I labour, while the devil through so many places and times and occasions lieth in
wait against me, He is to me a tower of strength, to whom when I shall have fled for refuge,
not only I shall escape the weapons of the enemy, but even against him securely I shall myself
hurl whatever darts I shall please. For Christ Himself is the tower, Himself for us hath been
made a tower from the face of the enemy, who is also the Rock whereon hath been builded
the Church. Art thou taking heed that thou be not smitten of the devil? Flee to the Tower;
never to that tower will the devil’s darts follow thee: there thou wilt stand protected and
fixed. But in what manner shalt thou flee to the Tower? Let not a man, set perchance in
temptation, in body seek that Tower, and when he shall not have found it, be wearied, or
faint in temptation. Before thee is the Tower: call to mind Christ, and go into the Tower.

Psalm LXI
5. “A sojourner I will be in Thy tabernacle even unto ages” (ver. 4). Ye see how he, of
whom we have spoken, is he that crieth. Which of us is a sojourner even unto ages? For a
few days here we live, and we pass away: for sojourners here we are, inhabitants in Heaven
we shall be. Thou art a sojourner in that place where thou art to hear the voice of the Lord
thy God, “Remove.” For from that Home everlasting in the Heavens no one will bid thee to
remove. Here therefore a sojourner thou art. Whence also is said in another Psalm, “A so-
journer I am with Thee and a stranger, as all my fathers were.”2344 Here therefore sojourners
we are; there the Lord shall give to us mansions everlasting: “Many are,” He saith, “the
mansions in My Father’s house.” 2345Those mansions not as though to sojourners He will
give, but as though to citizens to abide for everlasting. Here however, brethren, because for
no small time the Church was to be on this earth, but because here shall be the Church even
unto the end of the world:2346 therefore here He hath said, “A dweller I will be in Thy tab-
ernacle even unto ages.”2347…Well, of a few days thou wouldest choose that the temptations
should be: but how would She gather together all Her sons, unless for a long time She were
to be here, unless even unto the end She were to be prolonged? Do not envy the rest of
mankind that hereafter shall be: do not, because thou hast already passed over, wish to cut
down the bridge of mercy:2348 be it here even for ever. And what of temptations, which
needs must abound, by how much the more offences come? For Himself saith, “Because
iniquity hath abounded, the love of many shall wax cold.”2349 But that Church, which crieth
from the ends of the earth, is in these circumstances whereof he speaketh in continuation.
“But he that shall have persevered even unto the end, the same shall be saved.” But whence
shalt thou persevere?…“I shall be covered up in the veiling of Thy wings.” Behold the reason
why we are in safety amid so great temptations, until there come the end of the world, and
ages everlasting receive us; namely, because we are covered up in the veiling of His Wings.
There is heat in the world, but there is a great shade under the wings of God.
6. “For Thou, O God, hast hearkened to my prayer” (ver. 5). What prayer? That
wherewith he beginneth: “Hearken, O God, to my supplication.”…“Thou hast given inher-
itance to men fearing Thy name.” Let us continue therefore in the fear of God’s name: the
eternal Father deceiveth us not. Sons labour, that they may receive the inheritance of their
parents, to whom when dead they are to succeed: are we not labouring to receive an inher-

itance from that Father, to whom not dying we succeed; but together with Him in the very
inheritance for everlasting are to live?
7. “Days upon days of the King Thou shalt add to the years of Him” (ver. 6). This is
therefore the King of whom we are the members. A King Christ is, our Head, our King.
Thou hast given to Him days upon days; not only those days in that time that hath end, but
days upon those days without end. “I will dwell,” he saith, “in the house of the Lord, for
length of days.”2350 Wherefore for length of days, but because now is the shortness of days?
For everything which hath an end, is short: but of this King are days upon days, so that not
only while these days pass away, Christ reigneth in His Church, but the Saints shall reign
together with Him in those days which have no end.…For years of God have been also
spoken of: “But Thou art the very Same, and Thy years shall not fail.”2351 In the same
manner as years, so days, so one day. Whatsoever thou wilt thou sayest of eternity. Whatever
thou wilt thou sayest for this reason, because whatever thou shalt have said, it is too little
that thou hast said. For thou must needs say somewhat, to the end that there may be some-
thing whereby thou mayest meditate on that which cannot be told. “Even unto the day of
generation and of generation.” Of this generation and of the generation that shall be: of this
generation which is compared to the moon, because as the moon is new, waxeth, is full,
waneth, and vanisheth, so are these mortal generations; and of the generation wherein we
are born anew by rising again, and shall abide for everlasting with God, when now no longer
we are like the moon, but like that of which saith the Lord, “Then the righteous shall shine
like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”2352 For the moon by a figure in the Scriptures
is put for the mutability of this mortal state.…
8. “He shall abide for everlasting in the sight of God” (ver. 7); according to what, or be-
cause of what? “His mercy and truth who shall seek for Him?” He saith also in another place,
“All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, to men seeking His testament and His testi-
monies.”2353 Large is the discourse of truth and mercy, but shortness we have promised.
Briefly hear ye what is truth and mercy: because no small thing is that which hath been said,
“All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth.” Mercy is spoken of, because our merits God
regarded not, but His own goodness, in order that He might forgive us all our sins, and
might promise life everlasting: but truth is spoken of, because He faileth not to render those
things which He hath promised. Let us acknowledge it here, and let us do it; so that, just as
to us God hath shown forth His mercy and His truth, mercy in forgiving our sins, truth in
showing forth His promises; so also, I say, let us execute mercy and truth, mercy concerning

the weak, concerning the needy, concerning even our enemies; truth in not sinning, and in
not adding sin upon sin.…Who is therefore he that doeth this, save one out of those few,
of whom is said, “He that shall have continued unto the end, the same shall be saved”? With
reason here also “His mercy and truth who shall seek for Him?” Why is there “for Him”?
“Who shall seek,” would be sufficient. Why hath he added, “for Him,” but because many
men seek to learn His mercy and truth in His books? And when they have learned, for
themselves they live, not for Him;2354 their own things they seek, not the things which are
of Jesus Christ:2355 they preach mercy and truth, and do not mercy and truth. But by
preaching it, they know it: for they would not preach it, unless they knew it. But he that
loveth God and Christ, in preaching the mercy and truth of the Same, doth himself seek her
for Him, not for himself: that is, not in order that himself may have by this preaching tem-
poral advantages, but in order that he may do good to His members, that is, His faithful
ones, by ministering with truth of that which he knoweth: in order that he that liveth, no
longer for himself may live, but for Him that for all men hath died.2356
9. “So I will play music to Thy name, that I may render my vows from day unto day”
(ver. 8). If thou playest music to the name of God, play not for a time. Wilt thou for ever
play? wilt thou for everlasting play? Render to Him thy vows from day unto day. What is,
render to Him thy vows from day unto day? From this day unto that day. Continue to render
vows in this day, until thou come to that day: that is, “He that shall have continued even
unto the end, the same shall be saved.”2357

1. The title of it is, “Unto the end, in behalf of Idithun, a Psalm to David himself.” I re-
collect that already2359 to you hath been explained what Idithun is.…Let us see how far he
hath leaped over, and whom he hath “leaped over,” and in what place, though he hath leaped
over certain men, he is situate, whence as from a kind of spiritual and secure position he
may behold what is below.…He being set, I say, in a certain fortified place, doth say, “Shall
not my soul be subject to God?” (ver. 1). For he had heard, “He that doth exalt himself shall
be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted:”2360 and fearful lest by leaping
over he should be proud, not elated by those things which were below, but humble because
of Him that was above; to envious men, as it were threatening to him a fall, who were grieved
that he had leaped over, he hath made answer, “Shall not my soul be subject to God?”…“For
from Himself is my salvation.” “For Himself is my God and my salvation, my taker up, I
shall not be moved more” (ver. 2). I know who is above me, I know who stretcheth forth
His mercy to men that know Him, I know under the coverings of whose wings I should
hope: “I shall not be moved more.”…
2. Therefore, down from the higher place fortified and protected, he, to whom the Lord
hath been made a refuge, he, to whom is God Himself for a fortified place,2361 hath regard
to those whom he hath leaped over, and looking down upon them speaketh as though from
a lofty tower: for this also hath been said of Him, “A Tower of strength from the face of the
enemy:”2362 he giveth heed therefore to them, and saith, “How long do ye lay upon a man?”
(ver. 3). By insulting, by hurling reproaches, by laying wait, by persecuting, ye lay upon a
man burthens, ye lay upon a man as much as a man can bear:2363 but in order that a man
may bear, under him is He that hath made man. If to a man ye look, “slay ye, all of you.”
Behold, lay upon, rage, “slay ye, all of you.” “As though a wall bowed down, and as a fence
smitten against;” lean against, smite against, as if going to throw down. And where is, “I
shall not be moved more”? But wherefore? “I shall not be moved more.” Because Himself
is God my Saving One, my taker up, therefore ye men are able to lay burdens upon a man;
can ye anywise lay upon God, who protecteth man? “Slay ye, all of you.” What is that size
of body in one man so great as that he may be slain by all? But we ought to perceive our
person, the person of the Church, the person of the Body of Christ. For one Man with His
Head and Body is Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the Body and the Members of the Body: two

in one Flesh,2364 and in one voice, and in one passion, and, when iniquity shall have passed
over, in one rest. The sufferings therefore of Christ are not in Christ alone; nay, there are
not any save in Christ. For if Christ thou understandest to be Head and Body, the sufferings
of Christ are not, save in Christ: but if Christ thou understand of Head alone, the sufferings
of Christ are not in Christ alone. For if the sufferings of Christ are in Christ alone, to wit in
the Head alone; whence saith a certain member of Him, Paul the Apostle, “In order that I
may supply what are wanting of the oppressions of Christ in my flesh”?2365 If therefore in
the members of Christ thou art, whatsoever man thou art that art hearing these words,
whosoever thou art that dost hear these words (but however, thou dost hear, if in the
members of Christ thou art): whatsoever thing thou sufferest from those that are not in the
members of Christ, was wanting to the sufferings of Christ. Therefore it is added because
it was wanting; thou fillest up the measure, thou causest it not to run over: thou sufferest
so much as was to be contributed out of thy sufferings to the whole suffering of Christ, that
hath suffered in our Head, and doth suffer in His members, that is, in our own selves. Unto
this our common republic, as it were each of us according to our measure payeth that which
we owe, and according to the powers which we have, as it were a quota2366 of sufferings we
contribute. The storehouse2367 of all men’s sufferings will not be completely made up, save
when the world shall have been ended.…That whole City therefore is speaking, from the
blood of righteous Abel even to the blood of Zacharias.2368 Thence also hereafter from the
blood of John, through the blood of the Apostles, through the blood of Martyrs, through
the blood of the faithful ones of Christ, one City speaketh, one man saith, “How long do ye
lay upon a man? Slay ye, all of you.” Let us see if ye efface, let us see if ye extinguish, let us
see if ye remove from the earth the name thereof, let us see if ye peoples do not meditate of
empty things,2369 saying, “When shall She die, and when shall perish the name of Her?”2370
“As though She were a wall bowed down, and a fence smitten against,”2371 lean ye against
Her, smite against Her. Hear from above:2372 “My taker up, I shall not be moved more:”
for as though a heap of sand I have been smitten against that I might fall, and the Lord hath
taken me up.

3. “Nevertheless, mine honour they have thought to drive back” (ver. 4). Conquered
while they slay men yielding, by the blood of the slain multiplying the faithful, yielding to
these and no longer being able to kill; “Nevertheless, mine honour they have thought to
drive back.” Now because a Christian cannot be killed, pains are taken that a Christian
should be dishonoured. For now by the honour of Christians the hearts of ungodly men are
tortured: now that spiritual Joseph, after his selling by his brethren, after his removal from
his home into Egypt as though into the Gentiles, after the humiliation of a prison,2373 after
the made-up tale of a false witness, after that there had come to pass that which of him was
said, “Iron passed through the soul of him:”2374 now he is honoured, now he is not made
subject to brethren selling him, but corn he supplieth to them hungering.2375 Conquered
by his humility and chastity, uncorruptness, temptations, sufferings, now honoured they
see him, and his honour they think to check.…Is it all against one man, or one man against
all; or all against all, or one against one? Meanwhile, when he saith, “ye lay upon a man,” it
is as it were upon one man: and when he saith, “Slay all ye,” it is as if all men were against
one man: but nevertheless it is also all against all, because also all are Christians, but in One.
But why must those divers errors hostile to Christ be spoken of as all together? Are they
also one? Truly them also as one I dare to speak of: because there is one City and one city,
one People and one people, King and king. One City and one city is what? Babylon one,
Jerusalem one. By whatsoever other mystical names besides She is called, yet One City there
is and one city; over this the devil is king, over that Christ is King.…
4. Give heed, brethren, give heed, I entreat you. For it delighteth me yet to speak a few
words to you of this beloved City. For “most glorious things of Thee have been spoken, City
of God.”2376 And, “if I forget Thee, O Jerusalem, let mine own right hand forget me.”2377
For dear is the one Country, and truly but one Country, the only Country: besides Her
whatsoever we have, is a sojourning in a strange land. I will say therefore that which ye may
acknowledge, that of which ye may approve: I will call to your minds that which ye know,
I will not teach that which ye know not. “Not first,” saith the Apostle, “that which is spiritual,
but that which is natural,2378 afterwards that which is spiritual.”2379 Therefore the former
city is greater by age, because first was born Cain, and afterwards Abel:2380 but in these the

elder shall serve the younger.2381 The former greater by age, the latter greater in dignity.
Wherefore is the former greater by age? Because “not first that which is spiritual, but that
which is natural.”2382 Wherefore is the latter greater in dignity? Because “the elder shall
serve the younger.”2383…Cain first builded a city, and in that place he builded where no
city was. But when Jerusalem was being builded, it was not builded in a place where there
was not a city, but there was a city at first which was called Jebus, whence the Jebusites. This
having been captured, overcome, made subject, there was builded a new city, as though the
old were thrown down; and it was called Jerusalem,2384 vision of peace, City of God. Each
one therefore that is born of Adam, not yet doth belong to Jerusalem: for he beareth with
him the offshoot2385 of iniquity, and the punishment of sin, having been consigned to death,
and he belongeth in a manner to a sort of old city. But if he is to be in the people of God;
his old self will be thrown down, and he will be builded up new. For this reason therefore
Cain builded a city where there was not a city. For from mortality and from naughtiness
every one setteth out, in order that he may be made good hereafter. “For as by the disobedi-
ence of one man many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One Man many shall be
made just.”2386 And all we in Adam do die:2387 and each one of us of Adam was born. Let
him pass over to Jerusalem, he shall be thrown down old, and shall be builded new. As
though to conquered Jebusites, in order that there may be builded up Jerusalem, is said,
“Put ye off the old man, and put on the new.”2388 And now to them builded in Jerusalem,
and shining by the light of Grace, is said, “Ye have been sometime darkness, but now light
in the Lord.”2389 The evil city therefore from the beginning even unto the end doth run on,
and the good City by the changing of evil men is builded up. And these two cities are
meanwhile mingled, at the end to be severed; against each other mutually in conflict, the
one for iniquity, the other for the truth. And sometimes this very temporal mingling bringeth
it to pass that certain men belonging to the city Babylon, do order matters belonging to
Jerusalem, and again certain men belonging to Jerusalem, do order matters belonging to
Babylon. Something difficult I seem to have propounded. Be ye patient, until it be proved
by examples. “For all things” in the old people, as writeth the Apostle, “in a figure used to

befall them: but they have been written for our amendment, upon whom the end of the
world hath come.”2390 Regard therefore that people as also set to intimate an after people;
and see then what I say. There were great2391 kings in Jerusalem: it is a known fact, they are
enumerated, are named. They all were, I say, wicked citizens of Babylon, and they were or-
dering matters of Jerusalem: all men from thence to be dissevered at the end, to no one but
to the devil do belong. Again we find citizens of Jerusalem to have ordered certain matters
belonging to Babylon. For those three children, Nabuchodonosor, overcome by a miracle,
made the ministers of his kingdom, and set them over his Satraps; and so there were ordering
the matters of Babylon citizens of Jerusalem.2392 Observe now how this is being fulfilled
and done in the Church, and in these times.…Every earthly commonwealth, sometime as-
suredly to perish, whereof the kingdom is to pass away, when there shall come that kingdom,
whereof we pray, “Thy kingdom come;”2393 and whereof hath been foretold, “And of His
kingdom shall be no end:”2394 an earthly commonwealth, I say, hath our citizens conducting
the affairs of it. For how many faithful, how many good men, are both magistrates in their
cities, and are judges, and are generals, and are counts, and are kings? All that are just and
good men, having not anything in heart but the most glorious things, which of Thee have
been said, City of God.2395 And as if they were doing bond-service2396 in the city which is
to pass away, even there by the doctors of the Holy City they are bidden to keep faith with
those set over them, “whether with the king as supreme, or with governors as though sent
by God for the punishment of evil men, but for the praise of good men: ”2397 or as servants,
that to their masters they should be subject,2398 even Christians to Heathens, and the better
should keep faith with the worse, for a time to serve, for everlasting to have dominion. For
these things do happen until iniquity do pass away.2399 Servants are commanded to bear
with masters unjust and capricious: the citizens of Babylon are commanded to be endured
by the citizens of Jerusalem, showing even more attentions, than if they were citizens of the
same Babylon, as though fulfilling the precept, “He that shall have exacted of thee a mile,
go with him other twain.”2400…

5. “I have run in thirst.”2401 For they were rendering evil things for good things:2402 for
them was I thirsting: mine honour they thought to drive back: I was thirsting to bring them
over into my body. For in drinking what do we, but send into our members liquor that is
without, and suck it into our body? Thus did Moses in that head of the calf.2403 The head
of the calf is a great sacrament.2404 For the head of the calf was the body of ungodly men,
in the similitude of a calf eating hay,2405 seeking earthly things: because all flesh is
hay.2406…And what now is more evident, than that into that City Jerusalem, of which the
people Israel was a type, by Baptism men were to be made to pass over? Therefore in water
it was scattered, in order that for drink it might be given. For this even unto the end this
man thirsteth; he runneth and thirsteth. For many men He drinketh, but never will He be
without thirst. For thence is, “I thirst, woman, give Me to drink.”2407 That Samaritan woman
at the well found the Lord thirsting, and by Him thirsting she was filled: she first found Him
thirsting, in order that He might drink her believing. And when He was on the Cross, “I
thirst,”2408 He said, although they gave not to Him that for which He was thirsting. For for
themselves He was thirsting: but they gave vinegar, not new wine, wherewith are filled up
the new bottles, but old wine, but old to its loss.2409 For old vinegar also is said of the old
men, of whom hath been said, “For to them is no changing;”2410 namely, that the Jebusites
should be overthrown, and Jerusalem be builded.2411
6. So also the Head of this body even unto the end from the beginning runneth in thirst.
And as if to Him were being said, Why in thirst? what is wanting to Thee, O Body of Christ,
O Church of Christ? in so great honour, in so great exaltation, in so great height also even
in this world established, what is wanting to Thee? There is fulfilled that which hath been
foretold of thee, “There shall adore Him all kings of the earth, all nations shall serve Him.”
2412…They that at Jerusalem’s festivals fill up the Churches, at Babylon’s festivals fill up the

theatres: and for all they serve, honour, obey Her—not only those very persons that bear
the Sacraments of Christ, and hate the commandments of Christ, but also they, that bear
not even the mere Sacraments, Heathen though they be, Jews though they be,—they honour,
praise, proclaim, “but with their mouths they were blessing.” I heed not the mouth, He
knoweth that hath instructed me, “with their heart they were cursing.” In that place they
were cursing, where “mine honour they thought to drive back.”
7. What dost Thou, O Idithun, Body of Christ, leaping over them? What dost Thou
amid all these things? What wilt Thou? wilt faint? wilt Thou not persevere even unto the
end? wilt Thou not hearken, “He that shall have persevered even unto the end, the same
shall be saved,”2413 though for that iniquity aboundeth, the love of many shall wax cold?2414
And where is it that Thou hast leaped over them? where is it that Thy conversation is in
Heaven?2415 But they cleave unto earthly things, as though earthborn they mind the earth,
and are earth, the serpent’s food.2416 What dost thou amid these things?…“Nevertheless,
to God my soul shall be made subject” (ver. 5). And who would endure so great things,
either open wars, or secret lyings-in-wait? Who would endure so great things amid open
enemies, amid false brethren? Who would endure so great things? Would a man? and if a
man would, would a man of himself? I have not so leaped over that I should be lifted up,
and fall: “To God my soul shall be made subject: for from Himself is my patience.” What
patience is there amid so great scandals, except that “if for that which we do not see we hope,
through patience we look for it”?2417 There cometh my pain, there will come my rest also;
there cometh my tribulation, there will come my cleansing also. For doth gold glitter in the
furnace of the refiner? In a necklace it will glitter, in an ornament it will glitter: let it suffer
however the furnace, in order that being cleansed from dross it may come into light. This
is the furnace, there is there chaff, there gold, there fire, into this bloweth the refiner: in the
furnace burneth the chaff, and the gold is cleansed; the one into ashes is turned, of dross
the other is cleansed. The furnace is the world, the chaff unrighteous men, the gold just
men; the fire tribulation, the refiner God: that which therefore the refiner willeth I do;
wherever the Maker setteth me I endure it. I am commanded to endure, He knoweth how
to cleanse. Though there burn the chaff to set me on fire, and as if to consume me; that into
ashes is burned, I of dross am cleansed. Wherefore? Because “to God my soul shall be made
subject: for from Himself is my patience.”

8. “For Himself is my God and My Saving One, my Taker up, I will not remove hence”
(ver. 6). Because “Himself is my God,” therefore He calleth me: “and my Saving One,”
therefore He justifieth me: “and my Taker up,” therefore He glorifieth me. For here I am
called and am justified, but there I am glorified; and from thence where I am glorified, “I
will not remove.” For a sojourner I am with Thee on earth as all my fathers were. Therefore
from my lodging I shall remove, from my Heavenly home I shall not remove. “In God is
my salvation and my glory” (ver. 7). Saved I shall be in God, glorious I shall be in God: for
not only saved, but also glorious, saved, because a just man I have been made out of an un-
godly man, by Him justified;2418 but glorious, because not only justified, but also honoured.
For “those whom He hath predestined, those also He hath called.”2419 Calling them, what
hath He done here? “Whom He hath called, the same also He hath justified; but whom He
hath justified, the same also He hath glorified.” Justification therefore to salvation belongeth,
glorifying to honour. How glorifying to honour belongeth, it is not needful to discuss. How
justification belongeth to salvation, let us seek some proof. Behold there cometh to mind
out of the Gospel: there were some who to themselves were seeming to be just men, and
they were finding fault with the Lord because He admitted to the feast sinners, and with
publicans and sinners was eating; to such men therefore priding themselves, strong men of
earth very much lifted up, much glorying of their own soundness, such as they counted it,
not such as they had, the Lord answered what? “They that are whole need not a Physician,
but they that are sick.”2420 Whom calleth He whole, whom calleth He sick? He continueth
and saith, “I have not come to call just men, but sinners unto repentance.”2421 He hath
called therefore “the whole” just men, not because the Pharisees were so, but because
themselves they thought so to be; and for this reason were proud, and grudged sick men a
physician, and being more sick than those, they slew the Physician. He hath called whole,
however, righteous men, sick, the sinners. My being justified therefore, saith that man that
leapeth over, from Himself I have: my being glorified, from Himself I have: “For God is my
salvation and my glory.” “My salvation,” so that saved I am: “my glory,” so that honoured
I am. This thing hereafter: now what? “God of my help, and my hope is in God;” until I attain
unto perfect justification and salvation. “For by hope we are saved: but hope which is seen,
is not hope.”2422…
9. “Hope ye in Him all the council of the people” (ver. 8). Imitate ye Idithun, leap over
your enemies; men fighting against you, stopping up your way, men hating you, leap ye

over: “Hope in Him all the council of the people: pour out before Him your hearts:”…By
imploring, by confessing, by hoping. Do not keep back your hearts within your hearts: “Pour
out before Him your hearts.” That perisheth not which ye pour out. For He is my Taker up.
If He taketh up, why fearest thou to pour out? “Cast upon the Lord thy care, and hope in
Him.”2423 What fear ye amid whisperers, slanderers hateful to God,2424 where they are able
openly assailing, where they are unable secretly lying in wait, falsely praising, truly at enmity,
amid them what fear ye? “God is our Helper.” Do they anywise equal God? Are they anywise
stronger than He? “God is our Helper,” be ye without care. “If God is for us, who is against
us?”2425 “Pour out before Him your hearts,” by leaping over unto Him, by lifting up your
souls: “God is our helper.”…“Nevertheless, vain are the sons of men, and liars are the sons
of men in the balances, in order that they may deceive, being at one because of vanity” (ver.
9). Certainly many men there are: behold there is that one man, that one man that was cast
forth from the multitude of guests. 2426 They conspire, they all seek things temporal, and
they that are carnal things carnal, and for the future they hope them, whosoever do hope:
even if because of variety of opinions they are in division, nevertheless because of vanity
they are at one. Divers indeed are errors and of many forms, and the kingdom against itself
divided shall not stand:2427 but alike in all is the will vain and lying, belonging to one king,
with whom into fire everlasting it is to be thrown headlong2428—“these men because of
vanity are at one.” And for them see how He thirsteth, see how He runneth in thirst.
10. He turneth therefore Himself to them, thirsting for them: “Do not hope in iniquity”
(ver. 10). For my hope is in God. Ye that will not draw near and pass over, “do not hope in
iniquity.” For I that have leapt over, my hope is in God; and is there anywise iniquity with
God?2429 This thing let us do, that thing let us do, of that thing let us think, thus let us adjust
our lyings in wait; “Because of vanity being at one.” Thou thirstest: they that think of those
things against thee are given up by those whom thou drinkest, “Do not hope in vanity.”
Vain is iniquity, nought is iniquity, mighty is nothing save righteousness. Truth may be
hidden for a time, conquered it cannot be. Iniquity may flourish for a time, abide it cannot.
“Do not hope upon iniquity: and for robbery be not covetous.” Thou art not rich, and wilt
thou rob? What findest thou? What losest thou? O losing gains! Thou findest money, thou
losest righteousness. “For robbery be not covetous.”…Therefore, vain sons of men, lying

sons of men, neither rob, nor, if there flow riches, set heart upon them: no longer love vanity,
and seek lying. For “blessed is the man who hath the Lord God for his hope, and who hath
not had regard unto vanities, and lying follies.” 2430 Ye would deceive, ye would commit a
fraud, what bring ye in order that ye may cheat. Deceitful balances. For “lying,” he saith,
“are the sons of men in the balances,” in order that they may cheat by bringing forth deceitful
balances. By a false balance ye beguile men looking on: know ye not that one is he that
weigheth, Another He that judgeth of the weight? He seeth not, for whom thou weighest,
but He seeth that weigheth thee and him. Therefore neither fraud nor robbery covet ye any
longer, nor on those things which ye have set your hope:2431 I have admonished, have
foretold, saith this Idithun.
11. What followeth? “Once hath God spoken, these two things I have heard, that power
is of God (ver. 11), and to Thee, O Lord, is mercy, for Thou shalt render to each one after
his works” (ver. 12).…“Once hath God spoken.” What sayest thou, Idithun? If thou that
hadst leapt over them art saying, “Once He hath spoken;” I turn to another Scripture and
it saith to me, “In many quarters and in many ways formerly God hath spoken to the fathers
in the prophets.”2432 What is, “Once hath God spoken”? Is He not the God that in the be-
ginning of mankind spake to Adam?2433 Did not the Selfsame speak to Cain, to Noe, to
Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob, to all the Prophets, and to Moses?2434 One man Moses was,
and how often to him spake God? Behold even to one man, not once but ofttimes God hath
spoken. Secondly, He hath spoken to the Son when standing here, “Thou art My beloved
Son.”2435 God hath spoken to the Apostles, He hath spoken to all the Saints, even though
not with voice sounding through the cloud, nevertheless in the heart where He is Himself
Teacher.2436 What is therefore, “Once hath God spoken”? Much hath that man leapt over
in order to arrive at that place, where once God hath spoken. Behold briefly I have spoken
to your Love. Here among men, to men ofttimes, in many ways, in many quarters, through
creatures of many forms God hath spoken: by Himself once God hath spoken, because One
Word God hath begotten.…For it could not be but that God did Himself know that which
by the Word He made: 2437 but if that which He made He knew, in Him there was that
which was made before it was made. For if in Him was not that which was made before it

was made, how knew He that which He made? For thou canst not say that God made things
He knew not. God therefore hath known that which He hath made. And how knew He before
He made, if there cannot be known any but things made? But by things made there cannot
be known any but things previously made, by thee, to wit, who art a man made in a lower
place, and set in a lower place: but before that all these things were made, they were known
by Him by whom they were made, and that which He knew He made. Therefore in that
Word by which He made all things, before that they were made, were all things; and after
they have been made there are all things; but in one way here, in another there, in one way
in their own nature wherein they have been made, in another in the art by which they have
been made. Who could explain this? We may endeavour: go ye with Idithun, and see.
12. …For even the Lord saith, “Many things I have to say to you, but ye cannot bear
them now.”2438 What is therefore, “These two things I have heard”? These two things which
to you I am about to say not of myself to you I say, but what things I have heard I say. “Once
hath God spoken:” One Word hath He, the Only-begotten God. In that Word are all things,
because by the Word were made all things. One Word hath He, “in whom all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.”2439 One Word He hath, “once hath God spoken.”
“These two things,” which to you I am about to say, these I have heard: not of myself I speak,
not of myself I say: to this belongeth the “I have heard.”2440 But the friend of the Bridegroom
standeth and heareth Him, that he may speak the truth. For he heareth Him, lest by speaking
a lie, of his own he should speak:2441 lest thou shouldest say, Who art thou that sayest this
thing to me? whence dost thou say this to me? I have heard these two things, and I that
speak to thee that I have heard these two things, am one who also doth know that once God
hath spoken. Do not despise a hearer saying to thee certain two things for thee so necessary;
him, I say, that by leaping over the whole creation hath attained unto the Only-begotten
Word of God, where he hath learned that “once God hath spoken.”
13. Let him therefore now say certain two things. For greatly to us belong these two
things. “For power is of God, and to Thee, O Lord, is mercy.” Are these the two things,
power and mercy? These two evidently: perceive ye the power of God, perceive ye the mercy
of God. In these two things are contained nearly all the Scriptures. Because of these two
things are the Prophets, because of these two, the Patriarchs, because of these the Law, because
of these Himself our Lord Jesus Christ, because of these the Apostles, because of these all
the preaching and spreading of the word of God in the Church, because of these two, because
of the power of God, and His mercy. His power fear ye, His mercy love ye. Neither so on
2438 John xvi. 12.

2440 John viii. 26.
2441 John viii. 44.
Psalm LXII
His mercy rely, as that His power ye despise: nor so the power fear ye, as that of mercy ye
despair. With Him is power, with Him mercy. This man He humbleth, and that man He
exalteth:2442 this man He humbleth with power, that man He exalteth in mercy. “For if God,
willing to show wrath and to prove His power, hath in much patience borne with the vessels
of wrath, which have been perfected unto perdition”2443—thou hast heard of power: inquire
for mercy—“and that He might make known,” He saith, “His riches unto the vessels of
mercy.” It belongeth therefore to His power to condemn unjust men. And to Him who
would say, What hast thou done? “For thou, O man, who art thou that should make answer
to God?”2444 Fear therefore and tremble at His power: but hope for His mercy. The devil is
a sort of power; ofttimes however he wisheth to hurt, and is not able, because that power is
under power. For if the devil could hurt as much as he would; no one of just men would
remain, nor could any one of the faithful be on earth. The same through his vessels smiteth
against, as it were, a wall bowed down: but he only smiteth against, so far as he receiveth
power. But in order that the wall may not fall, the Lord will support: for He that giveth power
to the tempter, doth Himself to the tempted extend mercy. For according to measure the
devil is permitted to tempt. And, “Thou wilt give us to drink in tears in a measure.”2445 Do
not therefore fear the tempter permitted to do somewhat: for thou hast a most merciful Sa-
viour. So much he is permitted to tempt as is profitable for thee, that thou mayest be exer-
cised, mayest be proved; in order that by thyself thou mayest be found out, that knowest
not thyself. For where, or from whence, ought we to be secure, except by this power and
mercy of God? After that Apostolic saying, “Faithful is God, that doth not suffer you to be
tempted above that which ye are able.”2446…Fear not the enemy: so much he doeth as he
hath received power to do, Him fear thou that hath the chief power: Him fear, that doeth
as much as He willeth, and that doeth nothing unjustly, and whatever He shall have done,
is just. We might suppose something or other to be unjust: inasmuch as God hath done it,
believe it to be just.
14. Therefore, thou sayest, if any one slay an innocent man, doeth he justly or unjustly?
Unjustly certainly. Wherefore doth God permit this?…The counsel of God to tell to thee,
O man, I am not able: this thing however I say, both that the man hath done unjustly that
hath slain an innocent person, and that it would not have been done unless God permitted
it: and though the man hath done unjustly, yet God hath not unjustly permitted this. Let
the reason lie concealed in that person whoever it be, for whose sake thou art moved, whose

Psalm LXII
innocence doth much move thee. For to thee speedily I might make answer. He would not
have been slain unless he were guilty: but thou thinkest him innocent. I might speedily say
this to thee. For thou couldest not examine his heart, sift his deeds, weigh his thoughts, so
that thou couldest say to me, unjustly he was slain. I might easily therefore make answer:
but there is forced upon my view a certain Just One, without dispute just, without doubt
just, who had no sin, slain by sinners, betrayed by a sinner; Himself Christ the Lord, of
whom we cannot say that He hath any iniquity, for “those things which He robbed not He
paid,”2447 is made an objection to my answer. And why should I speak of Christ? “With
thee I am dealing,” thou sayest. And I with thee. About Him thou proposest a question,
about Him I am solving the question. For therein the counsel of God we know, which except
by His own revealing we should not know: so that when thou shalt have found out that
counsel of God, whereby He hath permitted His innocent Son to be slain by unjust men,
and such a counsel as pleaseth thee, and such a counsel as cannot displease thee, if thou art
just, thou mayest believe that in other things also by His counsel God doeth the same, but
it escaped thee. Ah! brethren, need there was of the blood of a just one to blot out the
handwriting of sins; need there was of an example of patience, of an example of humility;
need there was of the Sign of the Cross to beat down the devil and his angels; need for us
there was of the Passion of our Lord; for by the Passion of the Lord redeemed hath been the
world. How many good things hath the Passion of the Lord done! And yet the Passion of
this Just One would not have been, unless unrighteous men had slain the Lord. What then?
is this good thing which to us hath been granted by the Lord’s Passion to be ascribed to the
unjust slayers of Christ? Far be it. They willed, God permitted. They guilty would have been,
even if only they had willed it: but God would not have permitted it, unless just it had
been.…Accordingly, my brethren, both Judas the foul traitor to Christ, and the persecutors
of Christ, malignant all, ungodly all, unjust all, are to be condemned all: and nevertheless
the Father His own proper Son hath not spared, but for the sake of us all He hath delivered
Him up.2448 Order if thou art able; distinguish if thou art able (these things): render to God
thy vows, which thy lips have uttered: see what the unjust hath here done, what the Just
One. The one hath willed, the Other hath permitted: the one unjustly hath willed, the Other
justly hath permitted. Let unjust will be condemned, just permission be glorified. For what
evil thing hath befallen Christ, in that Christ hath died? Both evil were they that evil willed
to do, and yet nothing of evil did He suffer on whom they did it. Slain was mortal flesh,
slaying death by death, giving a lesson of patience, sending before an example of Resurrection.
How great good things of the Just One were wrought by the evil things of the unjust! This
is the great mystery2449 of God: that even a good thing which thou doest He hath Himself

given it to thee, and by thy evil He doeth good Himself. Do not therefore wonder, God
permitteth, and in judgment permitteth: He permitteth, and in measure, number, weight,
He permitteth. With Him is not iniquity:2450 do thou only belong to Him; on Himself thy
hope set thou, let Himself be thy Helper, thy Salvation: in Him be there the fortified place,
the tower of strength,2451 thy refuge let Himself be, and He will not suffer thee to be tempted
above that which thou art able to bear, but will make with the temptation also an escape,
that thou mayest be able to support it:2452 so that His suffering thee to bear temptation, be
His power; His suffering not any more on thee to be done than thou art able to bear, be His
mercy: “for power is of God, and to Thee, O Lord, is mercy, because Thou wilt render to
each one after his works.”
15. That thirst of the Church, would fain drink up that man also whom ye see.2453 At
the same time also, in order that ye may know how many in the mixed multitude of Chris-
tians with their mouth do bless, and in their heart curse, this man having been a Christian
and a believer returneth as a penitent, and being terrified by the power of the Lord, turneth
him to the mercy of the Lord. For having been led astray by the enemy when he was a believer,
long time he hath been an astrologer, led astray, leading astray, deceived, deceiving, he hath
allured, hath beguiled, many lies he hath spoken against God, That hath given to men power
of doing that which is good, and of not doing that which is evil. He used to say, that one’s
own will did not adultery, but Venus; one’s own will did not manslaying, but Mars; and
God did not what is just, but Jupiter; and many other blasphemous things, and not light
ones. From how many Christians do ye think he hath pocketed money? How many from
him have bought a lie, to whom we used to say, “Sons of men, how long are ye dull of heart,
wherefore love ye vanity, and seek a lie”?2454 Now, as of him must be believed, he hath
shuddered at his lie, and being the allurer of many men, he hath perceived at length that by
the devil he hath himself been allured, and he turneth to God a penitent. We think, brethren,
that because of great fear of heart it hath come to pass. For what must we say? If out of a
heathen an astrologer were converted, great indeed would be the joy: but nevertheless it
might appear, that, if he had been converted, he was desiring the clerical office in the Church.
A penitent he is, he seeketh not anything save mercy alone. He must be recommended
therefore both to your eyes and hearts. Him whom ye see in hearts love ye, with eyes guard
ye. See ye him, mark ye him, and whithersoever he shall have gone his way, to the rest of
the brethren that now are not here, point him out: and such diligence is mercy; lest that

leader astray drag back2455 his heart and take it by storm. Guard ye him, let there not escape
you his conversation, his way: in order that by your testimony it may be proved to us that
truly to the Lord he hath been turned. For report will not be silent about his life, when to
you he is thus presented both to be seen and to be pitied. Ye know in the Acts of the Apostles
how it is written, that many lost men, that is, men of such arts, and followers of naughty
doctrines, brought unto the Apostles all their books; and there were burned so many volumes,
that it was the writer’s task to make a valuation of them, and write down the sum of the
price.2456 This truly was for the glory of God, in order that even such lost men might not
be despaired of by Him that knew how to seek that which had been lost. Therefore this man
had been lost, is now sought, found,2457 led hither, he bringeth with him books to be burned,
by which he had been to be burned, so that when these have been thrown into the fire, he
may himself pass over into a place of refreshment. Know ye that he, brethren, once knocked
at the Church door before Easter:2458 for before Easter he began to ask of the Church Christ’s
medicine. But because the art wherein he had been practised is of such sort as that it was
suspected of lying and deceit, he was put off that he might not tempt; at length however he
was admitted, that he might not more dangerously be tempted. Pray for him through Christ.
Straightway to-day’s prayer pour out for him to the Lord our God. For we know and are
sure, that your prayer effaceth all his impieties. The Lord be with you.

Psalm LXII
Psalm LXIII.2459
1. This psalm hath the title, “For David himself, when he was in the desert of Idumæa.”
By the name of Idumæa is understood this world. For Idumæa was a certain nation of men
going astray, where idols were worshipped. In no good sense is put this Idumæa. If not in
a good sense it is put, it must be understood that this life, wherein we suffer so great toils,
and wherein to so great necessities we are made subject, by the name of Idumæa is signified.
2460 Even here is a desert where there is much thirst, and ye are to hear the voice of One
now thirsting in the desert. But if we acknowledge ourselves as thirsting, we shall acknowledge
ourselves as drinking also. For he that thirsteth in this world, in the world to come shall be
satisfied, according to the Lord’s saying, “Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness, for the same shall be satisfied.” 2461 Therefore in this world we ought not to
love fulness. Here we must thirst, in another place we shall be filled. But now in order that
we may not faint in this desert, He sprinkleth upon us the dew of His word, and leaveth us
not utterly to dry up, so that there should not be in our case any seeking of us again, but
that we may so thirst as that we may drink. But in order that we may drink, with somewhat
of His Grace we are sprinkled: nevertheless we thirst. And what saith our soul to God?
2. “God, my God, unto Thee from the light I watch” (ver. 1). What is to watch? It is, not
to sleep. What is to sleep? There is a sleep of the soul; there is a sleep of the body. Sleep of
body we all ought to have: because if sleep of body is not taken, a man fainteth, the body itself
fainteth. For our frail body cannot long sustain a soul watching and on the stretch on active
works; if for a long time the soul shall have been intent on active pursuits, the body being
frail and earthly holdeth her not, sustaineth her not for ever in activity, and fainteth and
falleth. Therefore God hath granted sleep to the body, whereby are recruited the members
of the body, in order that they may be able to sustain the soul watching. But of this let us
take heed, namely, that our soul herself sleep not: for evil is the sleep of the soul. Good is
the sleep of the body, whereby is recruited the health of the body. But the sleep of the soul
is to forget her God. Whatsoever soul shall have forgotten her God, sleepeth. Therefore the
Apostle saith to certain persons that forgot their God, and being as it were in sleep, did act
the follies of the worship of idols—the Apostle, I say, saith to certain persons, “Rise, thou
that sleepest, and rise up from the dead, and Christ shall enlighten thee.”2462 Was the Apostle
waking up one sleeping in body? Nay, but he was waking a soul sleeping, inasmuch as he
was waking her, in order that she might be lightened by Christ. Therefore as to these same
watchings saith this man, “God, my God, unto Thee from the light I watch.” For thou

Psalm LXIII
Psalm LXIII
wouldest not watch of thyself, unless there should arise thy Light, to wake thee from sleep.
For Christ lighteneth souls, and maketh them to watch: but if His light He taketh away, they
slumber. For for this cause to Him there is said in another psalm, “Lighten mine eyes, that
I may never slumber in death.”2463…
3. “My soul hath thirsted for Thee” (ver. 2). Behold that desert of Idumæa. See how here
he thirsteth: but see what good thing is here, “Hath thirsted for Thee.” For there are they
that thirst, but not for God. For every one that willeth anything to be granted to him, is in
the heat of longing; the longing itself is the thirst of the soul. And see ye what2464 longings
there are in the hearts of men: one longeth for gold, another longeth for silver, another
longeth for possessions, another inheritance, another abundance of money, another many
herds, another a wife, another honours, another sons. Ye see those longings, how they are
in the hearts of men. All men are inflamed with longing, and scarce is found one to say, “My
soul hath thirsted for Thee.” For men thirst for the world: and perceive not themselves to
be in the desert of Idumæa, where their souls ought to thirst for God.…
4. Wisdom therefore must be thirsted after, righteousness must be thirsted after. With
it we shall not be satisfied, with it we shall not be filled, save when this life shall have been
ended, and we shall have come to that which God hath promised. For God hath promised
equality with Angels:2465 and now the Angels thirst not as we do, they hunger not as we do;
but they have the fulness of truth, of light, of immortal wisdom. Therefore blessed they are,
and out of so great blessedness, because they are in that City, the Heavenly Jerusalem, afar
from whence we now are sojourning in a strange land, they observe us sojourners, and they
pity us, and by the command of the Lord they help us, in order that to this common country
sometime we may return, and there with them sometime with the Lord’s fountain of truth
and eternity we may be filled. Now therefore let our soul thirst: whence doth our flesh also
thirst, and this in many ways? “In many ways for Thee,” he saith, “my flesh also.” Because
to our flesh also is promised Resurrection. As to our soul is promised blessedness, so also
to our flesh is promised resurrection.…For if God hath made us that were not, is it a great
thing for Him to make again us that were? Therefore let not this seem to you to be incredible,
because ye see dead men as it were decaying, and passing into ashes and into dust. Or if any
dead man be burned, or if dogs tear him in pieces, do ye think that from this he will not rise
again? All things which are dismembered, and into a sort of dust do decay, are entire with
God. For into those elements of the world they pass, whence at first they have come, when
we were made: we do not see them; but yet God will bring them forth, He knoweth whence,
because even before we were, He created us from whence He knew. Such a resurrection of
2463 Ps. xiii. 3.
2464 Quanta.
2465 Luke xx. 36.
Psalm LXIII
the flesh therefore to us is promised, as that, although it be the same flesh that now we
carry2466 which is to rise again, yet it hath not the corruption which now it hath. For now
because of the corruption of frailty, if we eat not, we faint and are hungry; if we drink not,
we faint and are thirsty; if long time we watch, we faint and sleep; if long time we sleep, we
faint, therefore we watch.…Secondly, see how without any standing is our flesh: for infancy
passeth away into boyhood, and thou seekest infancy, and infancy is not, for now instead
of infancy is boyhood: again this same also passeth into youth, thou seekest boyhood and
findest not: the young man becometh a middle-aged man, thou seekest the young man and
he is not: the middle-aged man becometh an old man, thou seekest a middle-aged man and
findest not: and an old man dieth, thou seekest an old man and findest not: our age therefore
standeth not still: everywhere is weariness, everywhere faintness, everywhere corruption.
Observing what a hope of resurrection God promiseth to us, in all those our manifold
faintings we thirst for that incorruption: and so our flesh manifoldly doth thirst for God.
5. Nevertheless, my brethren, the flesh of a good Christian and a believer even in this
world for God doth thirst: for if the flesh hath need of bread, if it hath need of water, if it
hath need of wine, if it hath need of money, if this flesh hath need of a beast, from God it
ought to seek it, not from demons and idols and I know not what powers of this world. For
there are certain who when they suffer hunger in this world, leave God and ask Mercury or
ask Jove to give unto them, or her whom they call “Heavenly,”2467 or any the like demons:
not for God their flesh thirsteth. But they that thirst for God,2468 everywhere ought to thirst
for Him, both soul and flesh: for to the soul also God giveth His bread, that is the Word of
Truth: and to the flesh God giveth the things which are necessary, for God hath made both
soul and flesh. For the sake of thy flesh thou askest of demons: hath God made the soul, and
the demons made the flesh? He that hath made the soul, the Same hath made the flesh also:
He that hath made both of them, the Same feedeth both of them. Let either part of us thirst
for God, and after labour manifold let either simply be filled.
6. But where thirsteth our soul, and our flesh manifoldly, not for any one but for Thee,
O Lord, that is our God? it thirsteth where? “In a land desert, and without way, and without
water.” Of this world we have spoken, the same is Idumæa, this is the desert of Idumæa,
2466 [The same as to identity (i.e., of continuity), not the same as to material. But see Tertullian, vol. iii.
2467 Ed. Ben. refers to Tertullian, Apol. xxiii., where Virgo Cœlestis is represented as “promising rain,” and
St. Augustin, De Civ. Dei, ii. 4, where the same goddess is mentioned as worshipped together with Berecynthia,
the mother of the gods. [An intimation of the lingerings of heathenism, now Paganism, the religion of Rustics.
But how easily this Virgo Cœlestisbecame a new idolatry among Christians is here illustrated. Compare Coleridge’s
paraphrase of Schiller, “The fair humanities of old religion,” etc.—C.]
2468 Oxf. mss. Deo.
Psalm LXIII
whence the Psalm hath received its title. “In a land desert.” Too little it is to say “desert,”
where no man dwelleth; it is besides, both “without way, and without water.” O that the
same desert had even a way: O that into this a man running, even knew where he might
thence get forth!…Evil is the desert, horrible, and to be feared: and nevertheless God hath
pitied us, and hath made for us a way in the desert, Himself our Lord Jesus Christ:2469 and
hath made for us a consolation in the desert, in sending to us preachers of His Word: and
hath given to us water in the desert, by fulfilling with the Holy Spirit His preachers, in order
that there might be created in them a well of water springing up unto life everlasting.2470
And, lo! we have here all things, but they are not of the desert.…
7. “Thus in a holy thing I have appeared to Thee, that I might see Thy power and Thy
glory” (ver. 3).…Unless a man first thirst in that desert, that is in the evil wherein he is, he
never arriveth at the good, which is God. But “I have appeared to Thee,” he saith, “in a holy
thing.” Now in a holy thing is there great consolation. “I have appeared to Thee,” is what?
In order that Thou mightest see me: and for this reason Thou hast seen me, in order that I
might see Thee. “I have appeared to Thee, that I might see.” He hath not said, “I have ap-
peared to Thee, that Thou mightest see:” but, “I have appeared to Thee, that I might see Thy
power and Thy glory.” Whence also the Apostle, “But now,” he saith, “knowing God, nay,
having been known of God.”2471 For first ye have appeared to God, in order that to you
God might be able to appear. “That I might see Thy power and Thy glory.” In truth in that
forsaken place, that is, in that desert, if as though from the desert a man striveth to obtain
enough for his sustenance, he will never see the power of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord,
but he will remain to die of thirst, and will find neither way, nor consolation, nor water,
whereby he may endure in the desert. But when he shall have lifted up himself to God, so
as to say to Him out of all his inward parts, “My soul hath thirsted for Thee; how manifoldly
for Thee also my flesh!” lest perchance even the things necessary for the flesh of others he
ask, and not of God, or else long not for that resurrection of the flesh, which God hath
promised to us: when, I say, he shall have lifted up himself, he will have no small consolations.
8. …But ye have heard but now when the Gospel was being read in what terms He hath
notified His Majesty: “I and My Father are One.”2472 Behold how great a Majesty and how
great an Equality with the Father hath come down to the flesh because of our infirmity.
Behold how greatly beloved we have been, before that we loved God. If before that we loved
God, so much by Him we were beloved, as that His Son, Equal with Himself, He made a
Man for our sake, what doth He reserve for us now loving Him? Therefore many men think
2469 John xiv. 6.
2470 John iv. 14.
2471 Gal. iv. 9.
2472 John x. 30.
Psalm LXIII
it to be a very small thing that the Son of God hath appeared on earth; because they are not
in the Holy One, to them hath not appeared the power of the Same and the glory of the
Same: that is, not yet have they a heart made holy, whence they may perceive the eminence
of that virtue, and may render thanks to God, nor that to which for their own sakes so great
an One came, unto what a nativity, unto what a Passion, they are not able to see, His glory
and His power.2473
9. “For better is Thy mercy than2474 lives.” Many are the lives of men, but one life God
promiseth: and He giveth not this to us as if for our merits but for His mercy.…For what is
so just a thing as that a sinner should be punished? Though a just thing it be that a sinner
should be punished, it hath belonged to the mercy of Him not to punish a sinner but to
justify him, and of a sinner to make a just man, and of an ungodly man to make a godly
man. Therefore “His mercy is better than lives.” What lives? Those which for themselves
men have chosen. One hath chosen for himself a life of business, another a country life,
another a life of usury, another a military life; one this, another that. Divers are the lives,
but “better is Thy” life “than” our “lives.”…“My lips shall praise Thee.” My lips would not
praise Thee, unless before me were to go Thy mercy. By Thy gift Thee I praise, through Thy
mercy Thee I praise. For I should not be able to praise God, unless He gave me to be able
to praise Him.
10. “So I will speak good of Thee in my life, and in Thy name I will lift up my hands”
(ver. 5). Now in my life which to me Thou hast given, not in that which I have chosen after
the world with the rest among many lives, but that which Thou hast given to me through
Thy mercy, that I should praise Thee. “So I will speak good of Thee in my life.” What is
“so”? That to Thy mercy I may ascribe my life wherein Thee I praise, not to my merits. “And
in Thy name I will lift up my hands.” Lift up therefore hands in prayer. Our Lord hath lifted
up for us His hands on the Cross, and stretched out were His hands for us, and therefore
were His hands stretched out on the Cross, in order that our hands might be stretched out
unto good works: because His Cross hath brought us mercy. Behold, He hath lifted up hands,
and hath offered for us Himself a Sacrifice to God, and through that Sacrifice have been ef-
faced all our sins. Let us also lift up our hands to God in prayer: and our hands being lifted
up to God shall not be confounded, if they be exercised in good works. For what doth he
that lifteth up hands? Whence hath it been commanded that with hands lifted up we should
pray to God? For the Apostle saith, “Lifting up pure hands without anger and dissension.”2475
It is in order that when thou liftest up hands to God, there may come into thy mind thy
works. For whereas those hands are lifted up that thou mayest obtain that which thou wilt,
2473 The construction here seems imperfect.
2474 Lat. “above.”
2475 1 Tim. ii. 8.
Psalm LXIII
those same hands thou thinkest in good works to exercise, that they may not blush to be
lifted up to God. “In thy name I will lift up my hands.” Those are our prayers in this Idumæa,
in this desert, in the land without water and without way, where for us Christ is the Way,
2476 but not the way of this earth.
11. …Already our fathers are dead, but God liveth: here we could not always have
fathers, but there we shall alway have one living Father, when we have our father-land.…What
sort of country is that? But thou lovest here riches. God Himself shall be to thee thy riches.
But thou lovest a good fountain. What is more passing clear than that wisdom? What more
bright? Whatsoever is an object of love here, in place of all thou shalt have Him that hath
made all things, “as though with marrow and fatness my soul should be filled: and lips of
exultation shall praise Thy name.” In this desert, in Thy name I will lift up my hands: let
my soul be filled as though with marrow and fatness, “and my lips with exultation shall
praise Thy name.” For now is prayer, so long as there is thirst: when thirst shall have passed
away, there passeth away praying and there succeedeth praising. “And lips of exultation
shall praise Thy name.”
12. “If I have remembered Thee upon my bed, in the dawnings I did meditate on thee
(ver. 7): because Thou hast become my helper” (ver. 8). His “bed” he calleth his rest. When
any one is at rest, let him be mindful of God; when any one is at rest, let him not by rest be
dissolved, and forget God: if mindful he is of God when he is at rest, in his actions on God
he doth meditate. For the dawn he hath called actions, because every man at dawn beginneth
to do something. What therefore hath he said? If therefore I was not mindful on my bed,
in the dawn also I did not meditate on Thee. Can he that thinketh not of God when he is at
leisure, in his actions think of God? But he that is mindful of Him when he is at rest, on the
Same doth meditate when he is doing, lest in action he should come short. Therefore he
hath added what? “Because Thou has become my helper.” For unless God aid our good
works, they cannot be accomplished by us. And worthy things we ought to work: that is, as
though in the light, since by Christ showing the way we work. Whosoever worketh evil
things, in the night he worketh, not in the dawn; according to the Apostle, saying, “They
that are drunken, in the night are drunken; and they that sleep, in the night do sleep; let us
that are of the day, be sober.”2477 He exhorteth us that after the day we should walk honestly:
“As in the day, honestly let us walk.”2478 And again, “Ye,” he saith, “are sons of light, and
sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness.”2479 Who are sons of night, and sons of
darkness? They that work all evil things. To such a degree they are sons of night, that they

2477 1 Thess. v. 7, 8.
2478 Rom. xiii. 13.
2479 1 Thess. v. 5.
Psalm LXIII
fear lest the things which they work should be seen.…No one therefore in the dawn worketh,
except him that in Christ worketh. But he that while at leisure is mindful of Christ, on the
Same doth meditate in all his actions, and He is a helper to him in a good work, lest through
his weakness he fail. “And in the covering of Thy wings I will exult.” I am cheerful in good
works, because over me is the covering of Thy wings. If thou protect me not, forasmuch as
I am a chicken, the kite will seize me. For our Lord Himself saith in a certain place to that
Jerusalem, a certain city, where He was crucified: “Jerusalem,” He saith, “Jerusalem, how
often I have willed to gather thy sons, as though a hen her chickens, and thou wouldest
not.”2480 Little ones we are: therefore may God protect us under the shadow of His wings.
What when we shall have grown greater? A good thing it is for us that even then He should
protect us, so that under Him the greater, alway we be chickens. For alway He is greater,
however much we may have grown. Let no one say, let Him protect me while I am a little
one: as if sometime he would attain to such magnitude, as should be self-sufficient. Without
the protection of God, nought thou art. Alway by Him let us desire to be protected: then
alway in Him we shall have power to be great, if alway under Him little we be. “And in the
covering of Thy wings I will exult.”
13. “My soul hath been glued on behind Thee” (ver. 9). See ye one longing, see ye one
thirsting, see ye how he cleaveth to God. Let there spring up in you this affection. If already
it is sprouting, let it be rained upon and grow: let it come to such strength, that ye also may
say from the whole heart, “My soul hath been glued on behind Thee.” Where is that same
glue? The glue itself is love. Have thou love, wherewith as with glue thy soul may be glued
on behind God. Not with God, but behind God; that He may go before, thou mayest follow.
For he that shall have willed to go before God, by his own counsel would live, and will not
follow the commandments of God. Because of this even Peter was rebuked, when he willed
to give counsel to Christ, who was going to suffer for us.…“Far be it from Thee, O Lord, be
Thou merciful to Thyself.” And the Lord, “Go back behind Me, Satan: for thou savourest
not the things which are of God, but the things which are of men.”2481 Wherefore, the things
which are of men? Because to go before Me thou desirest, go back behind Me, in order that
thou mayest follow me: so that now following Christ he might say, “My soul hath been glued
on behind Thee.” With reason he addeth, “Me Thy right hand hath taken up.” This Christ
hath said in us: that is in the Man2482 which He was bearing for us, which He was offering
for us, He hath said this. The Church also said this in Christ, she saith it in her Head: for
2480 Matt. xxiii. 37.

2482 He does not mean by this phrase to attribute a twofold personality to our Lord, as appears from his
Retractations on Ps. i. 1.
Psalm LXIII
she too hath suffered here great persecutions, and by her individual members even now she
suffereth.…
14. “But themselves in vain have sought my soul. They shall go unto the lower places
of the earth” (ver. 9). Earth they were unwilling to lose, when they crucified Christ: into the
lower places of the earth they have gone. What are the lower places of the earth? Earthly
lusts. Better it is to walk upon earth, than by lust to go under earth. For every one that in
prejudice of his salvation desireth earthly things, is under the earth: because earth he hath
put before him, earth upon himself he hath put, and himself beneath he hath laid. They
therefore fearing to lose earth, said what of the Lord Jesus Christ, when they saw great
multitudes go after Him, forasmuch as He was doing wonderful things? “If we shall have
let Him go alive, there will come the Romans, and will take away from us both place and
nation.”2483 They feared to lose earth, and they went under the earth: there befell them even
what they feared. For they willed to kill Christ, that they might not lose earth; and earth they
therefore lost, because Christ they slew. For when Christ had been slain, because the Lord
Himself had said to them, “The kingdom shall be taken from you, and shall be given up to
a nation doing righteousness:”2484 there followed them great calamities of persecutions:
there conquered them Roman emperors, and kings of the nations: they were shut out from
that very place where they crucified Christ, and now that place is full of Christian praisers:
it hath no Jew, it hath been cleared of the enemies of Christ, it hath been fulfilled with the
praisers of Christ. Behold, they have lost at the hands of the Romans the place, because
Christ they slew, who to this end slew, that they might not lose the place at the hands of the
Romans. Therefore, “They shall enter into the lower places of the earth.”
15. “They shall be delivered unto the hands of the sword” (ver. 10). In truth, thus it hath
visibly befallen them, they have been taken by storm by enemies breaking in. “Portions of
foxes they shall be.” Foxes he calleth the kings of the world, that then were when Judæa was
conquered. Hear in order that ye may know and perceive, that those he calleth foxes. Herod
the king the Lord Himself hath called a fox. “Go ye,” He saith, “and tell that fox.”2485 See
and observe, my brethren: Christ as King they would not have, and portions of foxes they
have been made. For when Pilate the deputy governor in Judæa slew Christ at the voices of
the Jews, he said to the same Jews, “Your King shall I crucify?”2486 Because He was called
King of the Jews, and He was the true King. And they rejecting Christ said, “We have no
king but Cæsar.” They rejected a Lamb, chose a fox: deservedly portions of foxes they were
made.

Psalm LXIII
16. “The King in truth,”2487 is so written, because they chose a fox, a King in truth they
would not have. “The King in truth:” that is, the true King, to whom the title was inscribed,
when He suffered. For Pilate set this title inscribed over His Head, “The King of the Jews,”
in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin tongues: in order that all they that should pass by might
read of the glory of the King, and the infamy of the Jews themselves, who, rejecting the true
King, chose the fox Cæsar. “The King in truth shall rejoice in God.” They have been made
portions of foxes.…“Stopped up is the mouth of men speaking unjust things.” No one dareth
now openly to speak against Christ, now all men fear Christ. “For stopped up is the mouth
of men speaking unjust things.” When in weakness the Lamb was, even foxes were bold
against the Lamb. There conquered the Lion of the tribe of Judah,2488 and the foxes were
silenced.

Psalm LXIII
Psalm LXIV.2489
1. Though chiefly the Lord’s Passion is noticed in this Psalm, neither could the Martyrs
have been strong, unless they had beheld Him, that first suffered; nor such things would
they have endured in suffering, as He did, unless they had hoped for such things in the Re-
surrection as He had showed of Himself: but your Holiness2490 knoweth that our Head is
our Lord Jesus Christ, and that all that cleave unto Him are the members of Him the Head
.…And let no one say, that now-a-days in tribulation of passions we are not. For alway ye
have heard this fact, how in those times the whole Church together as it were was smitten
against, but now through individuals she is tried. Bound indeed is the devil, that he may
not do as much as he could, that he may not do as much as he would: nevertheless, he is
permitted to tempt as much as is expedient to men advancing. It is not expedient for us to
be without temptations: nor should we beseech God that we be not tempted, but that we be
not “led into temptation.”2491
2. Say we, therefore, ourselves also: “Hearken, O God, to my prayer, while I am troubled;
from fear of the enemy deliver my soul” (ver. 1). Enemies have raged against the Martyrs:
for what was that voice of Christ’s Body praying? For this it was praying, to be delivered
from enemies, and that enemies might not have power to slay them. Were they not therefore
hearkened to, because they were slain; and hath God forsaken His servants of a contrite
heart, and despised men hoping in Him? Far be it. For “who hath called upon God, and
hath been forsaken; who hath hoped in Him, and hath been deserted by Him?”2492 They
were hearkened to therefore, and they were slain; and yet from enemies they were delivered.
Others being afraid gave consent, and lived, and yet the same by enemies were swallowed
up. The slain were delivered, the living were swallowed up. Thence is also that voice of
thanksgiving, “Perchance alive they would have swallowed us up.”2493…Therefore for this
prayeth the voice of the Martyrs, “From fear of the enemy deliver Thou my soul:” not so
that the enemy may not slay me, but that I may not fear an enemy slaying. For that to be
fulfilled in the Psalm the servant prayeth, which but now in the Gospel the Lord was com-
manding. What but now was the Lord commanding? “Fear not them that kill the body, but
the soul are not able to kill; but Him rather fear ye, that hath power to kill both body and
soul in the hell of fire.”2494 And He repeated, “Yea, I say unto you, fear Him.”2495 Who are

they that kill the body? Enemies. What was the Lord commanding? That they should not
be feared. Be prayer offered, therefore, that He may grant what He hath commanded. “From
fear of the enemy deliver my soul.” Deliver me from fear of the enemy, and make me submit
to the fear of Thee. I would not fear him that killeth the body, but I would fear Him that
hath power to kill both body and soul in the hell of fire. For not from fear would I be free:
but from fear of the enemy being free, under fear of the Lord a servant.
3. “Thou hast protected me from the gathering together of malignants, and from the
multitude of men working iniquity” (ver. 2). Now upon Himself our Head let us look. Like
things many Martyrs have suffered: but nothing doth shine out so brightly as the Head of
Martyrs; in Him rather let us behold what they have gone through. Protected He was from
the multitude of malignants, God protecting Himself, the Son Himself and the Manhood2496
which He was carrying protecting His flesh: because Son of Man He is, and Son of God He
is; Son of God because of the form of God, Son of Man because of the form of a servant:
having in His power to lay down His life: and to take it again.2497 To Him what could enemies
do? They killed body, soul they killed not. Observe. Too little therefore it were for the Lord
to exhort the Martyrs with word, unless He had enforced it by example. Ye know what a
gathering together there was of malignant Jews, and what a multitude there was of men
working iniquity. What iniquity? That wherewith they willed to kill the Lord Jesus Christ.
“So many good works,” He saith, “I have shown to you, for which of these will ye to kill
Me?”2498 He endured all their infirm,2499 He healed all their sick, He preached the Kingdom
of Heaven, He held not His peace at their vices, so that these same should have been displeas-
ing to them, rather than the Physician by whom they were being made whole: for all these
His remedies being ungrateful, like men delirious in high fever raving at the physician, they
devised the plan of destroying Him that had come to heal them; as though therein they
would prove whether He were indeed a man, that could die, or were somewhat above men,
and would not suffer Himself to die. The word of these same men we perceive in the wisdom
of Solomon: “with death most vile,” say they, “let us condemn Him; let us question Him,
for there will be regard in the discourses of Him; for if truly Son of God He is, let Him deliver
Him.”2500 Let us see therefore what was done.
4. “For they have whet like a sword their tongues” (ver. 3). Which saith another Psalm
also, “Sons of men; their teeth are arms and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword.”2501

Psalm LXIV
Let not the Jews say, we have not killed Christ. For to this end they gave Him to Pilate the
judge, in order that they themselves might seem as it were guiltless of His death.…But if he
is guilty because he did it though unwillingly, are they innocent who compelled him to do
it? By no means. But he gave sentence against Him, and commanded Him to be crucified:
and in a manner himself killed Him; ye also, O ye Jews, killed Him. Whence did ye kill Him?
With the sword of the tongue: for ye did whet your tongues. And when did ye smite, except
when ye cried out, “Crucify, Crucify”?2502
5. But on this account we must not pass over that which hath come into mind, lest per-
chance the reading of the Divine Scriptures should disquiet any one. One Evangelist saith
that the Lord was crucified at the sixth hour,2503 and another at the third hour:2504 unless
we understand it, we are disquieted. And when the sixth hour was already beginning, Pilate
is said to have sat on the judgment-seat: and in reality when the Lord was lifted up upon
the tree, it was the sixth hour. But another Evangelist, looking unto the mind of the Jews,
how they wished themselves to seem guiltless of the death of the Lord, by his account proveth
them guilty, saying, that the Lord was crucified at the third hour. But considering all the
circumstance of the history, how many things might have been done, when before Pilate
the Lord was being accused, in order that He might be crucified; we find that it might have
been the third hour, when they cried out, “Crucify, Crucify.” Therefore with more truth
they killed at the time when they cried out. The ministers of the magistrate at the sixth hour
crucified, the transgressors of the law at the third hour cried out: that which those did with
hands at the sixth hour, these did with tongue at the third hour. More guilty are they that
with crying out were raging, than they that in obedience were ministering. This is the whole
of the Jews’ sagacity, this is that which they sought as some great matter. Let us kill and let
us not kill: so let us kill, as that we may not ourselves be judged to have killed.
6. “They have bended the bow, a bitter thing, in order that they may shoot in secret One
unspotted” (ver. 4). The bow he calleth lyings in wait. For he that with sword fighteth hand
to hand, openly fighteth: he that shooteth an arrow deceiveth, in order to strike. For the arrow
smiteth, before it is foreseen to come to wound. But whom could the lyings in wait of the
human heart escape? Would they escape our Lord Jesus Christ, who had no need that any
one should bear witness to Him of man? “For Himself knew what was in man,”2505 as the
Evangelist testifieth. Nevertheless, let us hear them, and look upon them in their doings as
2502 Luke xxiii. 21.
2503 John xix. 14.
2504 Mark xv. 25.
2505 John ii. 25.
Psalm LXIV
if the Lord knew not what they devise. The expression he used, “They have bended the bow,”
is the same as, “in secret:” as if they were deceiving by lyings in wait. For ye know by what
artifices they did this, how with money they bribed a disciple that clave to Him, in order
that He might be betrayed to them, 2506 how they procured false witnesses; with what lyings
in wait and artifices they wrought, “in order that they might shoot in secret One unspotted.”
Great iniquity! Behold from a secret place there cometh an arrow, which striketh One un-
spotted, who had not even so much of spot as could be pierced with an arrow. A Lamb indeed
He is unspotted, wholly unspotted, alway unspotted; not one from whom spots have been
removed but that hath contracted not any spots. For He hath made many unspotted by
forgiving sins, being Himself unspotted by not having sins. “Suddenly they shall shoot Him,
and shall not fear.” O heart hardened, to wish to kill a Man that did raise the dead! “Sud-
denly:” that is, insidiously, as if unexpectedly, as if not foreseen. For the Lord was like to
one knowing not, being among men knowing not what He knew not and what He knew:
yea, knowing not that there was nothing that He knew not, and that He knew all things, and
to this end had come in order that they might do that which they thought they did by their
own power.
7. “They have confirmed to themselves malignant discourse” (ver. 5). There were done
so great miracles, they were not moved, they persisted in the design of the evil discourse.
He was given up to the judge: the judge trembleth, and they tremble not that have given
Him up to the judge: trembleth power, and ferocity trembleth not: he would wash his hands,
and they stain their tongues. But wherefore this? “They have confirmed to themselves ma-
lignant discourse.” How many things did Pilate, how many things that they might be re-
strained! What said he? what did he? But “they have confirmed to themselves malignant
discourse: Crucify, crucify.”2507 The repetition is the confirmation of the “malignant dis-
course.” Let us see in what manner “they have confirmed to themselves malignant discourse.”
“Your King shall I crucify?” They said, “We have no king but Cæsar alone.”2508 He was of-
fering for King the Son of God: to a man they betook themselves: worthy were they to have
the one, and not have the Other. “I find not anything in this Man,” saith the judge, “wherefore
He is worthy of death.”2509 And they that “confirmed malignant discourse,” said, “His blood
be upon us and upon our sons.”2510 “They confirmed malignant discourse,” not to the Lord,
but to “themselves.” For how not to themselves when they say, “Upon us and upon our
sons”? That which therefore they confirmed, to themselves they confirmed: because the

2509 Luke xxiii. 14, 20, 22.
2510 Matt. xxvii. 25.
Psalm LXIV
same voice is elsewhere, “They dug before my face a ditch, and fell into it.” Death killed not
the Lord, but He death: but them iniquity killed, because they would not kill iniquity.…
8. “They told, in order that they might hide traps: they said, Who shall see them?” (ver.
5). They thought they would escape Him, whom they were killing, that they would escape
God. Behold, suppose Christ was a man, like the rest of men, and knew not what was being
contrived for Him: doth God also know not? O heart of man! wherefore hast thou said to
thyself, Who seeth me? when He seeth that hath made thee? “They said, Who shall see
them?”2511 God did see, Christ also was seeing: because Christ is also God. But wherefore
did they think that He saw not? Hear the words following.
9. “They have searched out iniquity, they have failed, searching searchings” (ver. 6): that
is, deadly and acute designs. Let Him not be betrayed by us, but by His disciple: let Him not
be killed by us, but by the judge: let us do all, and let us seem to have done nothing.…
10. But what befell them? “They failed searching searchings.” Whence? Because he saith,
“Who shall see them?” that is, that no one saw 2512 them. This they were saying, this among
themselves they thought, that no one saw them. See what befalleth an evil soul: it departeth
from the light of truth, and because itself seeth not God, it thinketh that itself is not seen by
God.…
11. For what followeth? “There shall draw near a man and a deep heart.” They said,
Who shall see us? They failed in searching searchings, evil counsels. There drew near a man
to those same counsels, He suffered Himself to be held as a man. For He would not have
been held except He were man, or have been seen except He were man, or have been smitten
except He were man, or have been crucified or have died except He were man. There drew
near a man therefore to all those sufferings, which in Him would have been of no avail except
He were Man. But if He were not Man, there would not have been deliverance for man.
There hath drawn near a Man “and a deep heart,” that is, a secret “heart:” presenting before
human faces Man, keeping within God: concealing the “form of God,” wherein He is equal
with the Father,2513 and presenting the form of a servant, wherein He is less than the Father.
For Himself hath spoken of both: but one thing there is which He saith in the form of God,
another thing in the form of a servant. He hath said in the form of God, “I and the Father
are one:”2514 He hath said in the form of a servant, “For the Father is greater than I.”2515
Whence in the form of God saith He, “I and the Father are one”?…

12. “Arrows of infants have been made the strokes of them” (ver. 7). Where is that sav-
ageness? where is that roar of the lion, of the people roaring and saying, “Crucify, Cruci-
fy”?2516 Where are the lyings in wait of men bending the bow? Have not “the strokes of
them been made the arrows of infants”? Ye know in what manner infants make to themselves
arrows of little canes. What do they strike, or whence do they strike? What is the hand, or
what the weapon? what are the arms, or what the limbs?
13. “And the tongues of them have been made weak upon them” (ver. 8). Let them whet
now their tongues like a sword, let them confirm to themselves malignant discourse. De-
servedly to themselves they have confirmed2517 it, because “the tongues of them have been
made weak upon them.” Could this be strong against God? “Iniquity,” he saith, “hath lied
to itself;”2518 “their tongues have been made weak upon them.” Behold, the Lord hath risen,
that was killed.…What thinkest thou of Him who from the cross came not down, and from
the tomb rose again? What therefore did they effect? But even if the Lord had not risen
again, what would they have effected, except what the persecutors of the martyrs have also
effected? For the Martyrs have not yet risen again, and nevertheless they have effected
nothing; of them not yet rising again we are now celebrating the nativities. Where is the
madness of their raging? To what did they bring those their searchings, in which searchings
they failed, so that even, when the Lord was dead and buried, they set guards at the tomb?
For they said to Pilate, “That deceiver;” by this name the Lord Jesus Christ was called, for
the comfort of His servants when they are called deceivers; they say therefore to Pilate, “That
deceiver said when yet living, After three days I will rise again:” 2519…They set for guards
soldiers at the sepulchre. At the earth quaking, the Lord rose again: such miracles were done
about the sepulchre, that even the very soldiers that had come for guards were made wit-
nesses, if they chose to tell the truth: but the same covetousness which had led captive a
disciple, the companion of Christ, led captive also the soldier that was guard of the sepulchre.
We give you, they say, money;2520 and say ye, while yourselves were sleeping there came
His disciples, and took Him away.…Sleeping witnesses ye adduce: truly thou thyself hast
fallen asleep, that in searching such devices hast failed. If they were sleeping, what could
they see? if nothing they saw, how are they witnesses? But “they failed in searching search-
ings:” failed of the light of God, failed in the very completion of their designs: when that
which they willed, nowise they were able to complete, surely they failed. Wherefore this?
Because “there drew near a Man and a deep heart, and God was exalted.”…

Psalm LXIV
14. “And every man feared” (ver. 9). They that feared not, were not even men. “Every
man feared;” that is, every one using reason to perceive the things which were done. Whence
they that feared not, must rather be called cattle, rather beasts savage and cruel. A lion
ramping and roaring is that people as yet. But in truth every man feared: that is, they that
would believe, that trembled at the judgment to come. “And every man feared: and they
declared the works of God.”…“And every man hath feared: and they have declared the
works of God, and His doings they have perceived.” What is, “His doings they have per-
ceived”? Was it, O Lord Jesus Christ, that Thou wast silent, and like a sheep for a victim
wast being led, and didst not open before the shearer Thy mouth,2521 and we thought Thee
to be set in smiting and in grief,2522 and knowing how to bear weakness?2523 Was it that
Thou wast hiding Thy beauty, O Thou beautiful in form before the sons of men?2524 Was
it that Thou didst not seem to have beauty nor grace?2525 Thou didst bear on the Cross men
reviling and saying, “If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross.”2526…This
thing they, that would have had Him come down from the Cross, perceived not: but when
He rose again, and being glorified ascended into Heaven, they perceived the works of God.
15. “The just man shall rejoice in the Lord” (ver. 10). Now the just man is not sad. For
sad were the disciples at the Lord’s being crucified; overcome with sadness, sorrowing they
departed, they thought they had lost hope. He rose again, even when appearing to them He
found them sad. He held the eyes of two men that walked in the way, so that by them he
was not known, and He found them groaning and sighing, and He held them until He had
expounded the Scriptures, and by the same Scriptures had shown that so it ought to have
been done as it was done.2527 For He showed in the Scriptures, how after the third day it
behoved the Lord to rise again.2528 And how on the third day would He have risen again,
if from the Cross He had come down?…Therefore let us all rejoice in the Lord, let us all
after the faith be One Just Man, and let us all in one Body hold One Head, and let us rejoice
in the Lord, not in ourselves: because our Good is not ourselves to ourselves, but He that
hath made us. Himself is our good to make us glad. And let no one rejoice in himself, no
one rely on himself, no one despair of himself: let no one rely on any man, whom he ought
to bring in to be the partner of his own hope, not the giver of the hope.

16. Now because the Lord hath risen again, now because He hath ascended into Heaven,
now because He hath showed that there is another life, now because it is evident that His
counsels, wherein He lay concealed in deep heart, were not empty, because to this end That
Blood was shed to be the price of the redeemed; now because all things are evident, because
all things have been preached, because all things have been believed, under the whole of
heaven, “the just man shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in Him; and all men shall be
praised that are right in heart.”…God is displeasing to thee, and thou art pleasing to thyself,
of perverted and crooked heart thou art: and this is the worse, that the heart of God thou
wouldest correct by thy heart, to make Him do what thou wilt have whereas thou oughtest
to do what He willeth. What then? Thou wouldest make crooked the heart of God which
alway is right, according to the depravity of thy own heart? How much better to correct thy
heart by the rectitude of God? Hath not thy Lord taught thee this, of Whose Passion but
now were we speaking? Was He not bearing thy weakness, when He said, “Sad is My soul
even unto death”?2529 Was He not figuring thyself in Himself, when He was saying, “Father,
if it be possible, let there pass from Me this cup”?2530 For the hearts of the Father and of the
Son were not two and different: but in the form of a servant He carried thy heart, that He
might teach it by His example. Now behold trouble found out as it were another heart of
thine, which willed that there should pass away that which was impending: but God would
not. God consenteth not to thy heart, do thou consent to the heart of God.
17. What followeth? If “there shall be praised all men right in heart,” there shall be
condemned the crooked in heart. Two things are set before thee now, choose while there is
time.…If of crooked heart thou hast become, there will come that Judgment, there will appear
all the reasons on account of which God doeth all these things: and thou that wouldest not
in this life correct thy heart by the rectitude of God, and prepare thyself for the right hand,
where “there shall be praised all men right in heart,” wilt be on the left, where at that time
thou shalt hear, “Go ye into fire everlasting, that hath been prepared for the devil and his
angels.”2531 And will there be then time to correct the heart? Now therefore correct, brethren,
now correct. Who doth hinder? Psalm is chanted, Gospel is read, Reader crieth, Preacher
crieth; long-suffering is the Lord; thou sinnest, and He spareth; still thou sinnest, still He
spareth, and still thou addest sin to sin. How long is God long-suffering? Thou wilt find
God just also. We terrify because we fear; teach us not to fear, and we terrify no more. But
better it is that God teach us to fear, than that any man teach us not to fear.…Thou bringest
forth grain, barn expect thou; bringest forth thorns, fire expect thou. But not yet hath come
either the time of the barn or the time of the fire: now let there be preparation, and there

will not be fear. In the name of Christ both we who speak are living, and ye to whom we
speak are living: for amending our plan, and changing evil life into a good life, is there no
place, is there no time? Can it not, if thou wilt, be done to-day? Can it not, if thou wilt, be
now done? What must thou buy in order to do it, what specifics2532 must thou seek? To
what Indies must thou sail? What ship prepare? Lo, while I am speaking, change the heart;
and there is done what so often and so long while is cried out for, that it be done, and which
bringeth forth everlasting punishment if it be not done.

Psalm LXIV
Psalm LXV.2533
1. The voice of holy prophecy must be confessed in the very title of this Psalm. It is in-
scribed, “Unto the end, a Psalm of David, a song of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, on account of the
people of transmigration when they were beginning to go forth.” How it fared with our
fathers2534 in the time of the transmigration to Babylon, is not known to all, but only to
those that diligently study the Holy Scriptures, either by hearing or by reading. For the
captive people Israel from the city of Jerusalem was led into slavery unto Babylon.2535 But
holy Jeremiah prophesied, that after seventy years the people would return out of captivity,
and would rebuild the very city Jerusalem, which they had mourned as having been over-
thrown by enemies. But at that time there were prophets in that captivity of the people
dwelling in Babylon, among whom was also the prophet Ezekiel. But that people was waiting
until there should be fulfilled the space of seventy years, according to the prophecy of
Jeremiah.2536 It came to pass, when the seventy years had been completed, the temple was
restored which had been thrown down: and there returned from captivity a great part of
that people. But whereas the Apostle saith, “these things in figure happened unto them, but
they have been written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the world hath come:”2537 we
also ought to know first our captivity, then our deliverance: we ought to know the Babylon
wherein we are captives, and the Jerusalem for a return to which we are sighing. For these
two cities, according to the letter, in reality are two cities. And the former Jerusalem indeed
by the Jews is not now inhabited. For after the crucifixion of the Lord vengeance was taken
upon them with a great scourge, and being rooted up from that place where, with impious
licentiousness being infuriated, they had madly raged against their Physician, they have
been dispersed throughout all nations, and that land hath been given to Christians: and
there is fulfilled what the Lord had said to them, “Therefore the kingdom shall be taken
away from you, and it shall be given to a nation doing justice.”2538 But when they saw great
multitudes then following the Lord, preaching the kingdom of Heaven, and doing wonderful
things, the rulers of that city said, “If we shall have let Him go, all men will go after Him,
and there shall come the Romans, and shall take from us both place and nation.”2539 That
they might not lose their place, they killed the Lord; and they lost it, even because they killed.

Psalm LXV
Psalm LXV
Therefore that city, being one earthly, did bear the figure of a certain city everlasting in the
Heavens: but when that which was signified began more evidently to be preached, the
shadow, whereby it was being signified, was thrown down: for this reason in that place now
the temple is no more, which had been constructed for the image of the future Body of the
Lord. We have the light, the shadow hath passed away: nevertheless, still in a kind of captivity
we are: “So long as we are,” he saith, “in the body, we are sojourning afar from the Lord.”2540
2. And see ye the names of those two cities, Babylon and Jerusalem. Babylon is interpreted
confusion, Jerusalem vision of peace. Observe now the city of confusion, in order that ye
may perceive the vision of peace; that ye may endure that, sigh for this. Whereby can those
two cities be distinguished? Can we anywise now separate them from each other? They are
mingled, and from the very beginning of mankind mingled they run on unto the end of the
world. Jerusalem received beginning through Abel, Babylon through Cain: for the buildings
of the cities were afterwards erected. That Jerusalem in the land of the Jebusites was builded:
for at first it used to be called Jebus,2541 from thence the nation of the Jebusites was expelled,
when the people of God was delivered from Egypt, and led into the land of promise. But
Babylon was builded in the most interior regions of Persia, which for a long time raised its
head above the rest of nations. These two cities then at particular times were builded, so
that there might be shown a figure of two cities begun of old, and to remain even unto the
end in this world, but at the end to be severed. Whereby then can we now show them, that
are mingled? At that time the Lord shall show, when some He shall set on the right hand,
others on the left. Jerusalem on the right hand shall be, Babylon on the left.…Two loves
make up these two cities: love of God maketh Jerusalem, love of the world maketh Babylon.
Therefore let each one question himself as to what he loveth: and he shall find of which he
is a citizen: and if he shall have found himself to be a citizen of Babylon, let him root out
cupidity, implant charity: but if he shall have found himself a citizen of Jerusalem, let him
endure captivity, hope for liberty.…Now therefore let us hear of, brethren, hear of, and sing
of, and long for, that city whereof we are citizens. And what are the joys which are sung of
to us? In what manner in ourselves is formed again the love of our city, which by long so-
journing we had forgotten? But our Father hath sent from thence letters to us, God hath
supplied to us the Scriptures, by which letters there should be wrought in us a longing for
return: because by loving our sojourning, to enemies we had turned our face, and our back
to our fatherland. What then is here sung?
3. “For Thee a hymn is meet, O God, in Sion” (ver. 1). That fatherland is Sion: Jerusalem
is the very same as Sion; and of this name the interpretation ye ought to know. As Jerusalem
is interpreted vision of peace, so Sion Beholding,2542 that is, vision and contemplation. Some

2541 Josh. xviii. 28.

Psalm LXV
great inexplicable sight to us is promised: and this is God Himself that hath builded the city.
Beauteous and graceful the city, how much more beauteous a Builder it hath! “For Thee a
hymn is meet, O God,” he saith. But where? “In Sion:” in Babylon it is not meet. For when
a man beginneth to be renewed, already with heart in Jerusalem he singeth, with the Apostle
saying, “Our conversation is in the Heavens.” 2543 For “in the flesh though walking,” he
saith, “not after the flesh we war.”2544 Already in longing we are there, already hope into
that land, as it were an anchor, we have sent before, lest in this sea being tossed we suffer
shipwreck. In like manner therefore as of a ship which is at anchor, we rightly say that
already she is come to land, for still she rolleth, but to land in a manner she hath been brought
safe in the teeth of winds and in the teeth of storms; so against the temptations of this so-
journing, our hope being grounded in that city Jerusalem causeth us not to be carried away
upon rocks. He therefore that according to this hope singeth, in that city singeth: let him
therefore say, “For Thee a hymn is meet, O God, in Sion.”…
4. “And to Thee shall there be paid a vow in Jerusalem.” Here we vow, and a good thing
it is that there we should pay. But who are they that here do vow and pay not? They that
persevere not even unto the end2545 in that which they have vowed. Whence saith another
Psalm, “Vow ye, and pay ye unto the Lord your God:”2546 and, “to Thee shall it be paid in
Jerusalem.” For there shall we be whole, that is, entire in the resurrection of just men: there
shall be paid our whole vow, not soul alone, but the very flesh also, no longer corruptible,
because no longer in Babylon, but now a body heavenly and changed. What sort of change
is promised? “For we all shall rise again,” saith the Apostle, “but we shall not2547 all be
changed.…Where is, O death, thy sting?”2548 For now while there begin in use the first-
fruits of the mind, from whence is the longing for Jerusalem, many things of corruptible
flesh do contend against us, which will not contend, when death shall have been swallowed
up in victory. Peace shall conquer, and war shall be ended. But when peace shall conquer,
that city shall conquer which is called the vision of peace. On the part of death therefore
shall be no contention. Now with how great a death do we contend! For thence are carnal
pleasures, which to us even unlawfully do suggest many things: to which we give no consent,
but nevertheless in giving no consent we contend.…
5. “Hearken,” he saith, “to my prayer, unto Thee every flesh shall come” (ver. 2). And
we have the Lord saying, that there was given to Him “power over every flesh.”2549 That

Psalm LXV
King therefore began even now to appear, when there was being said, “Unto Thee every
flesh shall come.” “To Thee,” he saith, “every flesh shall come.” Wherefore to Him shall
“every” flesh come? Because flesh He hath taken to Him. Whither shall there come every
flesh? He took the first-fruits thereof out of the womb of the Virgin; and now that the first-
fruits have been taken to Him, the rest shall follow, in order that the holocaust may be
completed. Whence then “every flesh”? Every man. And whence every man? Have all been
foretold, as going to believe in Christ? Have not many ungodly men been foretold, that shall
be condemned also? Do not daily men not believing die in their own unbelief? After what
manner therefore do we understand, “Unto Thee every flesh shall come”? By “every flesh”
he hath signified, “flesh of every kind:” out of every kind of flesh they shall come to Thee.
What is, out of every kind of flesh? Have there come poor men, and have there not come
rich men? Have there come humble men, and not come lofty men? Have there come un-
learned men, and not come learned men? Have there come men, and not come women?
Have there come masters, and not come servants? Have there come old men, and not come
young men; or have there come young men, and not come youths; or have there come
youths, and not come boys; or have there come boys, and have there not been brought in-
fants? In a word, have there come Jews 2550 (for thence were the Apostles, thence many
thousands of men at first betraying, afterwards believing2551), and have there not come
Greeks; or have there come Greeks, and not come Romans; or have there come Romans,
and not come Barbarians? And who could number all nations coming to Him, to whom
hath been said, “Unto Thee every flesh shall come”?
6. “The discourses of unjust men have prevailed over us, and our iniquities Thou shalt
propitiate”2552 (ver. 3).…Every man, in whatsoever place he is born, of that same land or
region or city learneth the language, is habituated to the manners and life of that place. What
should a boy do, born among Heathens, to avoid worshipping a stone, inasmuch as his
parents have suggested that worship? from them the first words he hath heard, that error
with his milk he hath sucked in; and because they that used to speak were elders, and the
boy that was learning to speak was an infant, what could the little one do but follow the
authority of elders, and deem that to be good which they recommended? Therefore nations
that are converted to Christ afterwards, and taking to heart the impieties of their parents,
and saying now what the prophet Jeremias himself said, “Truly a lie our fathers have wor-
shipped, vanity which hath not profited them”2553—when, I say, they now say this, they
renounce the opinions and blasphemies of their unjust parents.…There have led us away

Psalm LXV
men teaching evil things, citizens of Babylon they have made us, we have left the Creator,
have adored the creature: have left Him by whom we were made, have adored that which
we ourselves have made. For “the discourses of unjust men have prevailed over us:” but
nevertheless they have not crushed us. Wherefore? “Our impieties Thou shalt propitiate,”
is not said except to some priest offering somewhat, whereby impiety may be expiated and
propitiated. For impiety is then said to be propitiated, when God is made propitious to the
impiety. What is it for God to be made propitious to impiety? It is, His becoming forgiving,
and giving pardon. But in order that God’s pardon may be obtained, propitiation is made
through some sacrifice. There hath come forth therefore, sent from God the Lord, One our
Priest; He took upon Him from us that which He might offer to the Lord; we are speaking
of those same first-fruits of the flesh from the womb of the Virgin. This holocaust He offered
to God. He stretched out His hands on the Cross, in order that He might say, “Let My
prayer be directed as incense in Thy sight, and the lifting up of My hands an evening sacri-
fice.”2554 As ye know, the Lord about eventide hung on the Cross:2555 and our impieties
were propitiated; otherwise they had swallowed up: the discourses of unjust men had pre-
vailed over us; there had led us astray preachers of Jupiter, and of Saturn, and of Mercury:
“the discourses of ungodly men had prevailed over us.” But what wilt Thou do? “Our impi-
eties Thou wilt propitiate.” Thou art the priest, Thou the victim; Thou the offerer, Thou the
offering.2556…
7. “Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen, and hast taken to Thee” (ver. 4). Who is he
that is chosen by Him and taken to Him? Was any one chosen2557 by our Saviour Jesus
Christ, or was Himself after the flesh, because He is man, chosen and taken to Him?…Or
hath not rather Christ Himself taken to Him some blessed one, and the same whom He
hath taken to Him is not spoken of in the plural number but in the singular? For one man
He hath taken to Him, because unity He hath taken to Him. Schisms He hath not taken to
Him, heresies He hath not taken to Him: a multitude they have made of themselves, there
is not one to be taken to Him. But they that abide in the bond of Christ and are the members
of Him, make in a manner one man, of whom saith the Apostle, “Until we all arrive at the
acknowledging of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ.”2558 Therefore one man is taken to Him, to which the Head is Christ; be-
cause “the Head of the man is Christ.”2559 The same is that blessed man that “hath not de-

parted in the counsel of ungodly men,”2560 and the like things which there are spoken of:
the same is He that is taken to Him. He is not without us, in His own members we are, under
one Head we are governed, by one Spirit we all live, one fatherland we all long for.…And
to us He will give what? “He shall inhabit,” he saith, “in Thy courts.” Jerusalem, that is, to
which they sing that begin to go forth from Babylon: “He shall inhabit in Thy courts: we
shall be filled with the good things of Thy House.” What are the good things of the House
of God? Brethren, let us set before ourselves some rich house, with what numerous good
things it is crowded, how abundantly it is furnished, how many vessels there are there of
gold and also of silver; how great an establishment of servants, how many horses and animals,
in a word, how much the house itself delights us with pictures, marble, ceilings, pillars, re-
cesses, chambers:—all such things are indeed objects of desire, but still they are of the con-
fusion of Babylon. Cut off all such longings, O citizen of Jerusalem, cut them off; if thou
wilt return, let not captivity delight thee. But hast thou already begun to go forth? Do not
look back, do not loiter on the road. Still there are not wanting foes to recommend thee
captivity and sojourning: no longer let there prevail against thee the discourses of ungodly
men. For the House of God long thou, and for the good things of that House long thou: but
do not long for such things as thou art wont to long for either in thy house, or in the house
of thy neighbour, or in the house of thy patron.…
8. “Thy holy Temple is marvellous in righteousness” (ver. 5). These are the good things
of that House. He hath not said, Thy holy Temple is marvellous in pillars, marvellous in
marbles, marvellous in glided ceilings; but is “marvellous in righteousness.” Without thou
hast eyes wherewith thou mayest see marbles, and gold: within is an eye wherewith may be
seen the beauty of righteousness. If there is no beauty in righteousness, why is a righteous
old man loved? What bringeth he in body that may please the eyes? Crooked limbs, brow
wrinkled, head blanched with gray hairs, dotage everywhere full of plaints. But perchance
because thine eyes this decrepit old man pleaseth not, thine ears he pleaseth: with what
words? with what song? Even if perchance when a young man he sang well, all with age hath
been lost. Doth perchance the sound of his words please thine ears, that can hardly articulate
whole words for loss of teeth? Nevertheless, if righteous he is, if another man’s goods he
coveteth not, if of his own that he possesseth he distributeth to the needy, if he giveth good
advice, and soundly judgeth, if he believeth the entire faith, if for his belief in the faith he is
ready to expend even those very shattered limbs, for many Martyrs are even old men; why
do we love him? What good thing in him do we see with the eyes of the flesh? Not any.
There is therefore a kind of beauty in righteousness, which we see with the eye of the heart,
and we love, and we kindle with affection: how much men found to love in those same
Martyrs, though beasts tare their limbs! Is it possible but that when blood was staining all
2560 Ps. i. 1.
Psalm LXV
parts, when with the teeth of monsters their bowels gushed out, the eyes had nothing but
objects to shudder at? What was there to be loved, except that in that hideous spectacle of
mangled limbs, entire was the beauty of righteousness? These are the good things of the
House of God, with these prepare thyself to be satisfied.…“Blessed they which hunger and
thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.”2561 “Thy holy Temple is marvellous in
righteousness.” And that same temple, brethren, do not imagine to be aught but yourselves.
Love ye righteousness, and ye are the Temple of God.
9. “Hearken to us, O God, our Saviour” (ver. 5). He hath disclosed now Whom he
nameth as God. The “Saviour” specially is the Lord Jesus Christ. It hath appeared now more
openly of Whom he had said, “Unto Thee every flesh shall come.”2562 That One Man that
is taken unto Him into the Temple of God, is both many and is One. In the person of One
he hath said, “Hearken, O God, i.e., to my hunger:”2563 and because the same One of many
is composed, now he saith, “Hearken to us, O God, our Saviour.” Hear Him now more
openly preached: “Hearken to us, O God, our Saviour, the Hope of all the ends of the earth
and in the sea afar.” Behold wherefore hath been said “Unto Thee every flesh shall come.”
From every quarter they come. “Hope of all the ends of the earth,” not hope of one corner,
not hope of Judæa alone, not hope of Africa alone, not hope of Pannonia, not hope of East
or of West: but “Hope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar:” of the very ends of
the earth. “And in the sea afar:” and because in the sea, therefore afar. For the sea by a figure
is spoken of this world, with saltness bitter, with storms troubled; where men of perverse
and depraved appetites have become like fishes devouring one another. Observe the evil
sea, bitter sea, with waves violent, observe with what sort of men it is filled. Who desireth
an inheritance except through the death of another? Who desireth gain except by the loss
of another? By the fall of others how many men wish to be exalted? How many, in order
that they may buy, desire for other men to sell their goods? How they mutually oppress,
and how they that are able do devour! And when one fish hath devoured, the greater the
less, itself also is devoured by some greater.…Because evil fishes that were taken within the
nets they said they would not endure; they themselves have become more evil than they
whom they said2564 they could not endure. For those nets did take fishes both good and
evil. The Lord saith, “The kingdom of Heaven is like to a sein cast into the sea, which
gathereth of every kind, which, when it had been filled, drawing out, and sitting on the
shore, they gathered the good into vessels, but the evil they cast out: so it shall be,” He saith,
“in the consummation of the world.”2565 He showeth what is the shore, He showeth what
2561 Matt. v. 6.
2562 Ps. lxv. 2.
2563 Ps. lxv. 4.
2564 Al. “pretended.”
2565 Matt. xiii. 47–49.
Psalm LXV
is the end of the sea. “The angels shall go forth, and shall sever the evil from the midst of
the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.” Ha! ye citizens of Jerusalem that are within the nets, and are good fishes; endure the
evil, the nets break ye not: together with them ye are in a sea, not together with them will
ye be in the vessels. For “Hope” He is “of the ends of the earth,” Himself is Hope “also in
the sea afar.” Afar, because also in the sea.
10. “Preparing mountains in His strength” (ver. 6). Not in their strength. For He hath
prepared great preachers, and those same He hath called mountains; humble in themselves,
exalted in Him. “Preparing mountains in His strength.” What saith one of those same
mountains? “We ourselves in our own selves have had the answer of death, in order that in
ourselves we should not trust, but in God that raiseth the dead.” 2566 He that in himself doth
trust, and in Christ trusteth not, is not of those mountains which He hath prepared in His
strength. “Preparing mountains in His strength: girded about in power.” “Power,” I under-
stand: “girded about,” is what? They that put Christ in the midst, “girded about” they make
Him, that is on all sides begirt. We all have Him in common, therefore in the midst He is:
all we gird Him about that believe in Him: and because our faith is not of our strength, but
of His power; therefore girded about He is in His power; not in our own strength.
11. “That troublest the bottom of the sea” (ver. 7). He hath done this: it is seen what He
hath done. For He hath prepared mountains in His strength, hath sent them to preach:
girded about He is by believers in power: and moved is the sea, moved is the world, and it
beginneth to persecute His saints. “Girded about in power: that troublest the bottom of the
sea.” He hath not said, that troublest the sea; but “the bottom of the sea.” The bottom of the
sea is the heart of ungodly men. For just as from the bottom more thoroughly all things are
stirred, and the bottom holdeth firm all things: so whatsoever hath gone forth: by tongue,
by hands, by divers powers for the persecution of the Church, from the bottom hath gone
forth. For if there were not the root of iniquity in the heart, all those things would not have
gone forth against Christ. The bottom He troubled, perchance in order that the bottom He
might also empty: for in the case of certain evil men He emptied the sea from the bottom,
and made the sea a desert place. Another Psalm saith this, “That turneth sea into dry
land.”2567 All ungodly and heathen men that have believed were sea, have been made land;
with salt waves at first barren, afterwards with the fruit of righteousness productive. “That
troublest the bottom of the sea: the sound of its waves who shall endure?” “Who shall endure,”
is what? What man shall endure the sound of the waves of the sea, the behests of the high
powers of the world? But whence are they endured? Because He prepareth mountains in
His strength. In that therefore which he hath said “who shall” endure he saith thus: We
2566 2 Cor. i. 9.
2567 Ps. lxvi. 6.
Psalm LXV
ourselves of our own selves should not be able to endure those persecutions, unless He gave
strength.
12. “The nations shall be troubled” (ver. 8). At first they shall be troubled: but those
mountains prepared in the strength of Christ, are they troubled? Troubled is the sea, against
the mountains it dasheth: the sea breaketh, unshaken the mountains have remained. “The
nations shall be troubled, and all men shall fear.” Behold now all men fear: they that before
have been troubled do now all fear. The Christians feared not, and now the Christians are
feared. All that did persecute do now fear. For He hath overcome that is girded about with
power, to Him hath come every flesh in such sort, that the rest by their very minority do
now fear. And all men shall fear, that inhabit the ends of the earth, because of Thy signs.
For miracles the Apostles wrought, and thence all the ends of the earth have feared and have
believed. “Outgoings in morning and in evening Thou shalt delight:” that is, Thou makest
delightful. Already in this life what is there being promised to us? There are outgoings in
morning, there are outgoings in the evening. By the morning he signifieth the prosperity of
the world, by the evening he signifieth the trouble of the world.…At first when he was
promising gain, it was morning to thee: but now evening draweth on, sad thou hast become.
But He that hath given thee an outgoing in the morning, will give one also in the evening.
In the same manner as thou hast contemned the morning of the world by the light of the
Lord, so contemn the evening also by the sufferings of the Lord, in saying to thy soul, What
more will this man do to me, than my Lord hath suffered for me? May I2568 hold fast justice,
not consent to iniquity. Let him vent his rage on the flesh, the trap will be broken, and I will
fly to my Lord, that saith to me, “Do not fear them that kill the body, but the soul are not
able to kill.”2569 And for the body itself He hath given security, saying, “A hair of your head
shall not perish.”2570 Nobly here he hath set down, “Thou wilt delight outgoings in morning
and in evening.” For if thou take not delight in the very outgoing, thou wilt not labour to
go out thence. Thou runnest thy head into the promised gain, if thou art not delighted with
the promise of the Saviour. And again thou yieldest to one tempting and terrifying, if thou
find no delight in Him that suffered before thee, in order that He might make an outgoing
for thee.
13. “Thou hast visited the earth, and hast inebriated it” (ver. 9). Whence hast inebriated
the earth? “Thy cup inebriating how glorious it is!”2571 “Thou hast visited the earth, and
hast inebriated it.” Thou hast sent Thy clouds, they have rained down the preaching of the
truth, inebriated is the earth. “Thou hast multiplied to enrich it.” Whence? “The river of
2568 Oxf. mss. and old ed. “that I may.”
2569 Matt. x. 28.
2570 Luke xxi. 18.
2571 Ps. xxiii. 5.
Psalm LXV
God is filled with water.” What is the river of God? The people of God. The first people was
filled with water, wherewith the rest of the earth might be watered. Hear Him promising
water: “If any man thirst, let him come to Me and drink: he that believeth on Me, rivers of
living water from his belly shall flow:”2572 if rivers, one river also; for in respect of unity
many are one. Many Churches and one Church, many faithful and one Bride of Christ: so
many rivers and one river. Many Israelites believed, and were fulfilled with the Holy Spirit;
from thence they were scattered abroad through the nations, they began to preach the truth,
and from the river of God that was filled with water, was the whole earth watered. “Thou
hast prepared food for them: because thus is Thy preparing.” Not because they have deserved
of Thee, whom Thou hast forgiven sins: the merits of them were evil, but Thou for Thy
mercy’s sake, “because thus is Thy preparing,” thus “Thou hast prepared food for them.”
14. “The furrows thereof inebriate Thou” (ver. 10). Let there be made therefore at first
furrows to be inebriated: let the hardness of our breast be opened with the share of the word
of God, “The furrows thereof inebriate Thou: multiply the generations thereof.” We see,
they believe, and by them believing other men believe, and because of those others believe;
and it is not sufficient for one man, that having become himself a believer, he should gain
one. So is multiplied seed too: a few grains are scattered, and fields spring up. “In the drops
thereof it shall rejoice, when it shall rise up.” That is, before it be perchance enlarged to the
bulk of a river, “when it shall rise up, in its drops,” that is, in those meet for it, “it shall re-
joice.” For upon those that are yet babes, and upon the weak, are dropped some portions
of the sacraments, because they cannot receive the fulness of the truth. Hear in what manner
he droppeth upon babes, while they are rising up, that is, in their recent rising having small
capacities: the Apostle saith, “To you I could not speak as if to spiritual, but as if to carnal,
as if to babes in Christ.”2573 When he saith, “to babes in Christ,” he speaketh of them as
already risen up, but not yet meet to receive that plenteous wisdom, whereof he saith,
“Wisdom we speak among perfect men.”2574 Let it rejoice in its drops, while it is rising up
and is growing, when strengthened it shall receive wisdom also: in the same manner as an
infant is fed with milk, and becometh fit for meat, and nevertheless at first out of that very
meat for which it was not fit, for it milk is made.
15. “Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of Thy goodness” (ver. 11). Seed is now
sowing, that which is sown is growing, there will be the harvest too. And now over the seed
the enemy hath sown tares; and there have risen up evil ones among the good, false Christians,
having like leaf, but not like fruit. For those are properly called tares,2575 which spring up

Psalm LXV
in the manner of wheat, for instance darnel, for instance wild oats, and all such as have the
first leaf the same. Therefore of the sowing of the tares thus saith the Lord: “There hath
come an enemy, and hath sown over them tares;”2576 but what hath he done to the grain?
The wheat is not choked by the tares, nay, through endurance of the tares the fruit of the
wheat is increased. For the Lord Himself said to certain workmen desiring to root up the
tares, “Suffer ye both to grow unto the harvest.”2577…Conquer the devil, and thou wilt have
a crown. “Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of Thy goodness.” Again he maketh reference
to the goodness of God, lest any one boast of his own merits. “Thy plains shall be filled with
abundance.”
16. “The ends of the desert shall grow fat, and the hills shall be encircled with exultation”
(ver. 12). Plains, hills, ends of the desert, the same are also men. Plains, because of the
equality: because of equality, I say, from thence just peoples have been called plains. Hills,
because of lifting up: because God doth lift up in Himself those that humble themselves.
Ends of the desert are all nations. Wherefore ends of the desert? Deserted they were, to them
no Prophet had been sent: they were in like case as is a desert where no man passeth by. No
word of God was sent to the nations: to the people Israel alone the Prophets preached. We
came to the Lord;2578 the wheat believed among that same people of the Jews. For He said
at that time to the disciples, “Ye say, far off is the harvest: look back, and see how white are
the lands to harvest.” There hath been therefore a first harvest, there will be a second in the
last age. The first harvest was of Jews, because there were sent to them Prophets proclaiming
a coming Saviour. Therefore the Lord said to His disciples, “See how white are the lands to
harvest:” 2579 the lands, to wit, of Judæa. “Other men,” He saith, “have laboured, and into
their labours ye have entered.”2580 The Prophets laboured to sow, and ye with the sickle
have entered into their labours. There hath been finished therefore the first harvest, and
thence, with that very wheat which then was purged, hath been sown the round world; so
that there ariseth an other harvest, which at the end is to be reaped. In the second harvest
have been sown tares, now here there is labour. Just as in that first harvest the Prophets la-
boured until the Lord came: so in that second harvest the Apostles laboured, and all
preachers of the truth labour, even until at the end the Lord send unto the harvest His Angels.
Aforetime, I say, a desert there was, “but the ends of the desert shall grow fat.” Behold where
the Prophets had given no sound, the Lord of the Prophets hath been received, “The ends
of the desert shall grow fat, and with exultation the hills shall be encircled.”

Psalm LXV
17. “Clothed have been the rams of the sheep” (ver. 13): “with exultation” must be un-
derstood. For with what exultation the hills are encircled, with the same are clothed the
rams of the sheep. Rams are the very same as hills. For hills they are because of more eminent
grace; rams, because they are leaders of the flocks.…“They shall shout:” thence they shall
abound with wheat, because they shall shout. What shall they shout? “For a hymn they shall
say.” For one thing it is to shout against God, another thing to say a hymn; one thing to
shout iniquities, another thing to shout the praises of God. If thou shout in blasphemy,
thorns thou hast brought forth: if thou shoutest in a hymn, thou aboundest in wheat.
Psalm LXV
Psalm LXVI.2581
1. This Psalm hath on the title the inscription, “For the end, a song of a Psalm of Resur-
rection.” When ye hear “for the end,” whenever the Psalms are repeated, understand it “for
Christ:” the Apostle saying, “For the end of the law is Christ, for righteousness to every one
believing.”2582 In what manner therefore here Resurrection is sung, ye wilt hear, and whose
Resurrection it is, as far as Himself deigneth to give and disclose. For the Resurrection we
Christians know already hath come to pass in our Head, and in the members it is to be. The
Head of the Church is Christ,2583 the members of Christ are the Church. That which hath
preceded in the Head, will follow in the Body. This is our hope; for this we believe, for this
we endure and persevere amid so great perverseness of this world, hope comforting us, before
that hope becometh reality.…The Jews did hold the hope of the resurrection of the dead:
and they hoped that themselves alone would rise again to a blessed life because of the work
of the Law, and because of the justifications of the Scriptures, which the Jews alone had, and
the Gentiles had not. Crucified was Christ, “blindness in part happened unto Israel, in order
that the fulness of the Gentiles might enter in:”2584 as the Apostle saith. The resurrection
of the dead beginneth to be promised to the Gentiles also that believe in Jesus Christ, that
He hath risen again. Thence this Psalm is against the presumption and pride of the Jews,
for the comfort of the Gentiles that are to be called to the same hope of resurrection.
2. …Thence he beginneth, “Be joyful in God.” Who? “Every land” (ver. 1). Not therefore
Judæa alone. See, brethren, after what sort is set forth the universality of the Church in the
whole world spread abroad: and mourn ye not only the Jews, who envied the Gentiles that
grace, but still more for heretics wail ye. For if they are to be mourned, that have not been
gathered together, how much more they that being gathered together have been divided?
“Jubilate in God every land.” What is “jubilate”? Into the voice of rejoicings break forth if
ye cannot into that of words. For “jubilation” is not of words, but the sound alone of men
rejoicing is uttered, as of a heart labouring and bringing forth into voice the pleasure of a
thing imagined which cannot be expressed. “Be joyful in God every land:” let no one jubilate
in a part: let every land be joyful, let the Catholic Church jubilate. The Catholic Church
embraceth the whole: whosoever holdeth a part and from the whole is cut off, should howl,
not jubilate.
3. “But play ye to His name” (ver. 2). What hath he said? By you “playing” let His name
be blessed. But what it is to “play”? To play is also to take up an instrument which is called
a psaltery, and by the striking and action of the hands to accompany voices. If therefore ye

2584 Rom. xi. 25.
Psalm LXVI
Psalm LXVI
jubilate so that God may hear; play also something that men may both see and hear: but not
to your own name.…For if for the sake of yourselves being glorified ye do good works, we
make the same reply as He made to certain of such men, “Verily I say unto you, they have
received their reward:”2585 and again, “Otherwise no reward ye will have with your Father
that is in Heaven.”2586 Thou wilt say, ought I, then, to hide my works, that I do them not
before men? No. But what saith He? “Let your works shine before men.” In doubt then I
shall remain. On one side Thou sayest to me, “Take heed that ye do not your righteousness
before men:” on the other side Thou sayest to me, “Let your good works shine before men;”
what shall I keep? what do? what leave undone? A man can as well serve two masters com-
manding different things as one commanding different things. I command not, saith the
Lord, different things. The end observe, for the end sing: with what end thou doest it, see
thou. If for this reason thou doest it, that thou mayest be glorified, I have forbidden it: but
if for this reason, that God may be glorified, I have commanded it. Play therefore, not to
your own name, but to the name of the Lord your God. Play ye, let Him be lauded: live ye
well, let Him be glorified. For whence have ye that same living well? If for everlasting ye had
had it, ye would never have lived ill; if from yourselves ye had had it, ye never would have
done otherwise than have lived well. “Give glory to His praise.” Our whole attention upon
the praise of God he directeth, nothing for us he leaveth whence we should be praised. Let
us glory thence the more, and rejoice: to Him let us cleave, in Him let us be praised. Ye
heard when the Apostle was being read, “See ye your calling, brethren, how not many wise
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, but the foolish things of the world God
hath chosen to confound the wise.”2587…But the Lord chose afterwards orators also; but
they would have been proud, if He had not first chosen fishermen; He chose rich men; but
they would have said that on account of their riches they had been chosen, unless at first
He had chosen poor men: He chose Emperors afterwards; but better is it, that when an
Emperor hath come to Rome, he should lay aside his crown, and weep at the monument of
a fisherman, than that a fisherman should weep at the monument of an Emperor. “For the
weak things of the world God hath chosen to confound the strong,” etc.2588…And what
followeth? The Apostle hath concluded, “That there might not glory before God any flesh.”
See ye how from us He hath taken away, that He might give glory: hath taken away ours,
that He might give His own; hath taken away empty, that He might give full; hath taken
away insecure, that He might give solid.…

Psalm LXVI
4. “Say ye to God, How to be feared are Thy works!” (ver. 3). Wherefore to be feared
and not to be loved? Hear thou another voice of a Psalm: “Serve ye the Lord in fear, and
exult unto Him with trembling.”2589 What meaneth this? Hear the voice of the Apostle:
“With fear,” he saith, “and trembling, your own salvation work ye out.”2590 Wherefore with
fear and trembling? He hath subjoined the reason: “for God it is that worketh in you both
to will and to work according to good will.”2591 If therefore God worketh in thee, by the
Grace of God thou workest well, not by thy strength. Therefore if thou rejoicest, fear also:
lest perchance that which was given to a humble man be taken away from a proud
one.…Brethren, if against the Jews of old, cut off from the root of the Patriarchs, we ought
not to exalt ourselves, but rather to fear and say to God, “How to be feared are Thy works:”
how much less ought we not to exalt ourselves against the fresh wounds of the cutting off!
Before there had been cut off Jews, graffed in Gentiles; from the very graft there have been
cut off heretics; but neither against them ought we to exalt ourselves; lest perchance he deserve
to be cut off, that delighteth to revile them that are cut off. My brethren, a bishop’s voice,
however unworthy, hath sounded to you:2592 we pray you to beware, whosoever ye are in
the Church, do not revile them that are not within; but pray ye rather, that they too may be
within. For God is able again to graft them in.2593 Of the very Jews the Apostle said this,
and it was done in their case. The Lord rose again, and many believed: they perceived not
when they crucified, nevertheless afterwards they believed in Him, and there was forgiven
them so great a transgression. The shedding of the Lord’s blood was forgiven the manslayers,
not to say, God-slayers: “for if they had known, the Lord of glory they never would have
crucified.”2594 Now to the manslayers hath been forgiven the shedding of the blood of Him
innocent: and that same blood which through madness they shed, through grace they have
drunk.…O fulness of Gentiles, say thou to God, “How to be feared are Thy works!” and so
rejoice thou as that thou mayest fear, be not exalted above the branches cut off.
5. “In the multitude of thy power Thine enemies shall lie to Thee.” For this purpose he
saith, “to Thee thine enemies shall lie,” in order that great may be Thy power. What is this?
With more attention hearken. The power of our Lord Jesus Christ most chiefly appeared
in the Resurrection, from whence this Psalm hath received its title. And rising again, He
appeared to His disciples.2595 He appeared not to His enemies, but to His disciples. Crucified

Psalm LXVI
He appeared to all men, rising again to believers: so that afterwards also he that would might
believe, and to him that should believe, resurrection might be promised. Many holy men
wrought many miracles; no one of them when dead did rise again: because even they that
by them were raised to life, were raised to life to die.…Because therefore the Jews might say,
when the Lord did miracles, Moses hath done these things, Elias hath done, Eliseus hath
done them: they might for themselves say these words, because those men also did raise to
life dead men, and did many miracles: therefore when from Him a sign was demanded, of
the peculiar sign making mention which in Himself alone was to be, He saith, “This gener-
ation crooked and provoking2596 seeketh a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except
the sign of Jonas the Prophet: for as Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and three
nights, so shall be also the Son of Man in the heart of the earth three days and three
nights.”2597 In what way was Jonas in the belly of the whale? Was it not so that afterwards
alive he was vomited out? Hell2598 was to the Lord what the whale was to Jonas. This sign
peculiar to Himself He mentioned, this is the most mighty sign. It is more mighty to live
again after having been dead, than not to have been dead. The greatness of the power of the
Lord as He was made Man, in the virtue of the Resurrection doth appear.…
6. Observe also the very lie of the false witnesses in the Gospel, and see how it is about
Resurrection. For when to the Lord had been said, “What sign showest Thou to us, that
Thou doest these things?”2599 besides that which He had spoken about Jonah2600 through
another similitude of this same thing also He spake, that ye might know this peculiar sign
had been especially pointed out: “Destroy this Temple,” He saith, “and in three days I will
raise it up.” And they said, “In forty and six years was builded this temple, and wilt Thou
in three days raise it up?”2601 And the evangelist explaining what it was, “But this,” he saith,
“spake Jesus of the Temple of His Body.”2602 Behold this His power He said He would show
to men in the same thing as that from whence He had given the similitude of a Temple, be-
cause of His flesh, which was the Temple of the Divinity hidden within. Whence the Jews
outwardly saw the Temple, the Deity dwelling within they saw not. Out of those words of
the Lord false witnesses made up a lie to say against Him, out of those very words wherein
He mentioned His future Resurrection, in speaking of the Temple. For false witnesses, when
they were asked what they had heard Him say, alleged against Him: “We heard Him saying,

Psalm LXVI
I will destroy this Temple, and after three days I will raise it up.”2603 “After three days I will
raise up,” they had heard: “I will destroy,” they had not heard: but had heard “destroy ye.”
One word they changed and a few letters, in order to support their false testimony. But for
whom changest thou a word, O human vanity, O human weakness? For the Word, the Un-
changeable, dost thou change a word? Thou changest thy word, dost thou change God’s
Word?…Wherefore said they that Thou hadst said, “I will destroy;” and said not that which
Thou saidest, “destroy ye”? It was, as it were, in order that they might defend themselves
from the charge of destroying the Temple without cause. For Christ, because He willed it,
died: and nevertheless ye killed Him. Behold we grant you, O ye liars, Himself destroyed
the Temple. For it hath been said by the Apostle, “That loved me, and gave up Himself for
me.”2604 It hath been said of the Father, “That His own Son spared not, but gave Him up
for us all.”2605…By all means be it that Himself destroyed the Temple, Himself destroyed
that said, “Power I have to lay down My Soul,2606 and power I have again to take it: no one
taketh it from Me, but I Myself lay it down from Me, and again I take it.”2607 Be it that
Himself hath destroyed the Temple in His Grace, in your malice. “In the multitude of Thy
power thine enemies shall lie to Thee.” Behold they lie, behold they are believed, behold
Thou art oppressed, behold Thou art crucified, behold Thou art insulted, behold head is
wagged at Thee, “If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross.”2608 Behold
when Thou wilt, life Thou layest down, and with lance in the side art pierced, and Sacraments
from Thy side flow forth;2609 Thou art taken down from the Tree, wound in linens, laid in
the sepulchre, there are set guards lest Thy disciples take Thee away; there cometh the hour
of Thy Resurrection, earth is shaken, tombs are cloven, Thou risest again in secret, appearest
openly. Where then are those liars? Where is the false testimony of evil will? Have not Thine
enemies in the multitude of Thy power lied to Thee?
7. Give them also those guards at the Tomb, let them recount what they have seen, let
them take money and lie too.2610…They too were added to the lie of the enemies: increased
was the number of liars, that increased might be the reward of believers. Therefore they lied,
“in the multitude of Thy power” they lied: to confound liars Thou hast appeared to men of
truth, and Thou hast appeared to those men of truth whom Thou hast made men of truth.

8. Let Jews remain in their lies: to Thee, because in the multitude of Thy power they
lied, let there be done that which followeth, “Let every land worship Thee, and play to Thee,
play to Thy name, O Most Highest” (ver. 4). A little before, Most Lowly, now Most Highest:
Most Lowly in the hands of lying enemies; Most Highest above the head of praising Angels.
O ye Gentiles, O most distant nations, leave lying Jews, come confessing. “Come ye, and see
the works of the Lord: terrible in counsels above the sons of men” (ver. 5). Son of Man indeed
He too hath been called, and verily Son of Man He became: very Son of God in the form of
God;2611 very Son of Man in form of a servant: but do not judge of that form by the condition
of others alike: “terrible” He is “in counsels above the sons of men.” Sons of men took
counsel to crucify Christ, being crucified He blinded the crucifiers. What then have ye done,
sons of men, by taking keen counsels against your Lord, in whom was hidden Majesty, and
to sight shown weakness? Ye were taking counsels to destroy, He to blind and save; to blind
proud men, to save humble men: but to blind those same proud men, to the end that, being
blinded they might be humbled, being humbled might confess, having confessed might be
enlightened. “Terrible in counsels above the sons of men.” Terrible indeed. Behold blindness
in part to Israel hath happened:2612 behold the Jews, out of whom was born Christ, are
without: behold the Gentiles, that were against Judæa, in Christ are within. “Terrible in
counsels above the sons of men.”
9. Wherefore what hath He done by the terror of His counsel? He hath turned the sea
into dry land. For this followeth, “That hath turned the sea into dry land” (ver. 6). A sea was
the world, bitter with saltness, troubled with tempest, raging with waves of persecutions,
sea it was: truly into dry land the sea hath been turned, now there thirsteth for sweet water
the world that with salt water was filled. Who hath done this? He “that hath turned the sea
into dry land.” Now the soul of all the Gentiles saith what? “My soul is as it were land without
water to Thee.”2613 “That hath turned the sea into dry land. In the river they shall pass over
on foot.” Those same persons that have been turned into dry land, though they were before
sea, “in the river on foot shall pass over.” What is the river? The river is all the mortality of
the world. Observe a river: some things come and pass by, other things that are to pass by
do succeed. Is it not thus with the water of a river, that from earth springeth and floweth?
Every one that is born must needs give place to one going to be born: and all this order of
things rolling along is a kind of river. Into this river let not the soul greedily throw herself,
let her not throw herself, but let her stand still. And how shall she pass over the pleasures
of things doomed to perish? Let her believe in Christ, and she will pass over on foot: she
passeth over with Him for Leader, on foot she passeth over.

Psalm LXVI
10. “There we will be joyous in Him.” O ye Jews, of your own works boast ye: lay aside
the pride of boasting of yourselves, take up the Grace of being joyous in Christ. For therein
we will be joyous, but not in ourselves: “there we will be joyous in Him.” When shall we
joy? When we shall have passed over the river on foot. Life everlasting is promised, resurrec-
tion is promised, there our flesh no longer shall be a river: for a river it is now, while it is
mortality. Observe whether there standeth still any age. Boys desire to grow up; and they
know not how by succeeding years the span of their life is lessened. For years are not added
to but taken from them as they grow: just as the water of a river alway draweth near, but
from the source it withdraweth. And boys desire to grow up that they may escape the
thraldom of elders; behold they grow up, it cometh to pass quickly, they arrive at youth: let
them that have emerged from boyhood retain, if they are able, their youth: that too passeth
away. Old age succeedeth:2614 let even old age be everlasting; with death it is removed.
Therefore a river there is2615 of flesh that is born. This river of mortality, so that it doth not
by reason of concupiscence of things mortal undermine and carry him away, he easily passeth
over, that humbly, that is on foot, passeth over, He being leader that first hath passed over,
that of the flood in the way even unto death hath drunk, and therefore hath lifted up the
head.2616 Passing over therefore on foot that river, that is, easily passing over that mortality
that glideth along, “there we will be joyous in Him.” But now in what save in Him, or in the
hope of Him? For even if we are joyous now, in hope we are joyous; but then in Him we
shall be joyous. And now in Him, but through hope: “but then face to face.”2617 “There we
will be joyous in Him.”
11. In whom? “In Him that reigneth in His virtue for everlasting” (ver. 7). For what
virtue have we and is it everlasting? If everlasting were our virtue, we should not have slipped,
should not have fallen into sin, we should not have deserved penal mortality. He, of His
good pleasure, took up that whereunto our desert threw us down.2618 “That reigneth in His
virtue for everlasting.” Of Him partakers let us be made, in whose virtue we shall be strong,
but He in His own. We enlightened, He a light enlightening: we, being turned away from
Him, are in darkness; turned away from Himself He cannot be. With the heat of Him we
are warmed; from whence withdrawing we had grown cold, to the Same drawing near again
we are warmed. Therefore let us speak to Him that He may keep us in His virtue, because
“in Him we will be joyous that reigneth in His virtue for everlasting.”

Psalm LXVI
12. But this thing is not granted to believing Jews alone.…“The eyes of Him do look
upon the Gentiles.” And what do we? The Jews will murmur; the Jews will say, “what He
hath given to us, the same to them also; to us Gospel, to them Gospel; to us the Grace of
Resurrection, and to them the Grace of Resurrection; doth it profit us nothing that we have
received the Law, and that in the justifications of the Law we have lived, and have kept the
commandments of the fathers? Nothing will it avail? The same to them as to us.” Let them
not strive, let them not dispute. “Let not them that are bitter be exalted in their own
selves.”2619 O flesh miserable and wasting, art thou not sinful? Why crieth out thy tongue?
Let the conscience be listened to. “For all men have sinned, and need the glory of God.”2620
Know thyself, human weakness. Thou didst receive the Law, in order that a transgressor
also of the Law thou mightest be:2621 for thou hast not kept and fulfilled that which thou
didst receive. There hath come to thee because of the Law, not the justification which the
Law enjoineth, but the transgression which thou hast done. If therefore there hath abounded
sin, why enviest thou Grace more abounding. Be not bitter, for “let not them that are bitter
be exalted in their own selves.” He seemeth in a manner to have uttered a curse in “Let not
them that are bitter be exalted;” yea, be they exalted, but not “in themselves.” Let them be
humbled in themselves, exalted in Christ. For, “he that humbleth himself shall be exalted;
and he that exalteth himself shall be humbled.”2622 “Let not them that are bitter be exalted
in their own selves.”
13. “Bless our God, ye nations” (ver. 8). Behold, there have been driven back they that
are bitter, reckoning hath been made with them: some have been converted, some have
continued proud. Let not them terrify you that grudge the Gentiles Gospel Grace: now hath
come the Seed of Abraham, in whom are blessed all nations.2623 Bless ye Him in whom ye
are blessed, “Bless our God, ye nations: and hear ye the voice of His praise.” Praise not
yourselves, but praise Him. What is the voice of His praise? That by His Grace we are
whatever of good we are. “Who hath set my Soul unto life” (ver. 9) Behold the voice of his
praise: “Who hath set my Soul unto life.” Therefore in death she was: in death she was, in
thyself. Thence it is that ye ought not to have been exalted in yourselves. Therefore in death
she was, in thyself: where will it be in life, save in Him that said, “I am the Way, the Truth,
and the Life”?2624 Just as to certain believers the Apostle saith, “Ye were sometime darkness,
but now light in the Lord.”2625…“And hath not given unto motion my feet.” He hath set

my Soul unto life, He guideth the feet that they stumble not, be not moved and given unto
motion; He maketh us to live, He maketh us to persevere even unto the end, in order that
for everlasting we may live.…
14. “For thou hast proved us, O God; Thou hast fired us as silver is fired” (ver. 10). Hast
not fired us like hay, but like silver: by applying to us fire, Thou hast not turned us into
ashes, but Thou hast washed off uncleanness, “Thou hast fired us, as silver is fired.” And
see in what manner God is wroth against them, whose Soul He hath set unto life. “Thou
hast led us into a trap:” not that we might be caught and die, but that we might be tried and
delivered from it. “Thou hast laid tribulations upon our back.” For having been to ill purpose
lifted up, proud we were: having been to ill purpose lifted up, we were bowed down, in order
that being bowed down, we should be lifted up for good. “Thou hast laid tribulations on
our back:” “Thou hast set men over our heads” (ver. 11). All these things the Church hath
suffered in sundry and divers persecutions: She hath suffered this in Her individual members,
even now doth suffer it. For there is not one, that in this life could say that he was exempt
from these trials. Therefore there are set even men over our heads: we endure those whom
we would not, we suffer for our betters those whom we know to be worse. But if sins be
wanting, a man is justly superior: but by how much there are more sins, by so much he is
inferior. And it is a good thing to consider ourselves to be sinners, and thus endure men set
over our heads: in order that we also to God may confess that deservedly we suffer. For why
dost thou suffer with indignation that which He doeth who is just? “Thou hast laid tribula-
tions upon our back: Thou hast set men over our heads.” God seemeth to be wroth, when
He doeth these things: fear not, for a Father He is, He is never so wroth as to destroy. When
ill thou livest, if He spareth, He is more angry. In a word, these tribulations are the rods of
Him correcting, lest there be a sentence from Him punishing.…
15. “We have passed through fire and water.” Fire and water are both dangerous in this
life. Certainly water seemeth to extinguish fire, and fire seemeth to dry up water. Thus also
these are the trials, wherein aboundeth this life. Fire burneth, water corrupteth: both must
be feared, both the burning of tribulation and the water of corruption. Whenever there is
adversity, and anything which is called unhappiness in this world, there is as it were fire:
whenever there is prosperity, and the world’s plenty floweth about one, there is as it were
water. See that fire burn thee not, nor water corrupt.…Hasten not to the water: through fire
pass over to the water, that thou mayest pass over the water also. Therefore also in the
mystic rites2626 and in catechising and in exorcising,2627 there is first used fire. For whence
ofttimes do the unclean spirits cry out, “I burn,” if that is not fire? But after the fire of Exor-
cism we come to Baptism: so that from fire to water, from water unto refreshment. But as
2626 Sacramentis.
2627 Exorcism before Baptism.
Psalm LXVI
in the Sacraments, so it is in the temptations of this world: the straitness of fear draweth
near first, in place of fire; afterwards fear being removed, we ought to be afraid lest worldly
happiness corrupt. But when the fire hath not made thee burst, and when thou hast not
sunk in the water, but hast swum out; through discipline thou passest over to rest, and
passing over through fire and water, thou art led forth into a place of refreshment. For of
those things whereof the signs are in the Sacraments, there are the very realities in that
perfection of life everlasting.…But we are not torpid there, but we rest: nor though it be
called heat, shall we be hot there, but we shall be fervent in spirit. Observe that same heat
in another Psalm: “nor is there any one that hideth himself from the heat thereof.”2628 What
saith also the Apostle? “In spirit fervent.”2629 Therefore, “we have gone over through fire
and water: and Thou hast led us forth into a cool place.”
16. Observe how not only concerning a cool place, but neither of that very fire to be
desired he hath been silent: “I will enter into Thy House in holocausts” (ver. 13). What is a
holocaust? A whole sacrifice burned up, but with fire divine. For a sacrifice is called a
holocaust, when the whole is burned. One thing are the parts of sacrifices, another thing a
holocaust: when the whole is burned and the whole consumed by fire divine, it is called a
holocaust: when a part, a sacrifice. Every holocaust indeed is a sacrifice: but not every sacrifice
a holocaust. Holocausts therefore he is promising, the Body of Christ is speaking, the Unity
of Christ is speaking, “I will enter into Thy House in holocausts.” All that is mine let Thy
fire consume, let nothing of mine remain to me, let all be Thine. But this shall be in the Re-
surrection of just men, “when both this corruptible shall be clad in incorruption, and this
mortal shall be clad in immortality: then shall come to pass that which hath been written,
‘Death is swallowed up in victory.’”2630 Victory is, as it were, fire divine: when it swalloweth
up our death also, it is a holocaust. There remaineth not anything mortal in the flesh, there
remaineth not anything culpable in the spirit: the whole of mortal life shall be consumed,
in order that in life everlasting it may be consummated, that from death we may be preserved
in life.2631 These therefore will be the holocausts. And what shall there be “in the holocausts”?
17. “I will render to Thee my vows, which my lips have distinguished” (ver. 14). What
is the distinction in vows? This is the distinction, that thyself thou censure, Him thou praise:
perceive thyself to be a creature, Him the Creator: thyself darkness, Him the Enlightener,
to whom thou shouldest say, “Thou shalt light my lamp, O Lord my God, Thou shalt enlight-
en my darkness.”2632 For whenever thou shalt have said, O soul, that from thyself thou hast

Psalm LXVI
light, thou wilt not distinguish. If thou wilt not distinguish, thou wilt not render distinct
vows. Render distinct vows, confess thyself changeable, Him unchangeable: confess thyself
without Him to be nothing, but Himself without thee to be perfect; thyself to need Him,
but Him not to need thee. Cry to Him, “I have said to the Lord, My God art Thou, for my
good things Thou needest not.” 2633 Now though God taketh thee to Him for a holocaust,
He groweth not, He is not increased, He is not richer, He becometh not better furnished:
whatsoever He maketh of thee for thy sake, is the better for thee, not for Him that maketh.
If thou distinguishest these things, thou renderest the vows to thy God which thy lips have
distinguished.
18. “And my mouth hath spoken in my tribulation.” How sweet ofttimes is tribulation,
how necessary! In that case what hath the mouth of the same spoken in his tribulation?
“Holocausts marrowed I will offer to Thee” (ver. 15). What is “marrowed”? Within may I
keep Thy love, it shall not be on the surface, in my marrow it shall be that I love Thee. For
there is nothing more inward than our marrow: the bones are more inward than the flesh,
the marrow is more inward than those same bones. Whosoever therefore on the surface
loveth God, desireth rather to please men, but having some other affection within, he offereth
not holocausts of marrow: but into whosesoever marrow He looketh, him He receiveth
whole. “With incense and rams.” The rams are the rulers of the Church: the whole Body of
Christ is speaking: this is the thing which he offereth to God. Incense 2634 is what? Prayer.
“With incense and rams.” For especially the rams do pray for the flocks. “I will offer to Thee
oxen with he-goats.” Oxen we find treading out corn, and the same are offered to God. The
Apostle hath said, that of the preachers of the Gospel must be understood that which hath
been written, “Of the ox treading out corn the mouth thou shalt not muzzle. Doth God care
for oxen?”2635 Therefore great are those rams, great the oxen. What of the rest, that perchance
are conscious of certain sins, that perchance in the very road have slipped, and, having been
wounded, by penitence are being healed? Shall they too continue, and to the holocausts shall
they not belong? Let them not fear, he hath added he-goats also. “I will offer to Thee oxen
with he-goats.” By the very yoking are saved the he-goats; of themselves they have no strength,
being yoked to bulls they are accepted. For they have made friends of the mammon of
iniquity, that the same may receive them into everlasting tabernacles.2636 Therefore those
he-goats shall not be on the left, because they have made to themselves friends of the
mammon of iniquity. But what he-goats shall be on the left? They to whom shall be said, “I
hungred, and ye gave me not to eat:”2637 not they that have redeemed their sins by almsdeeds.

Psalm LXVI
19. Come ye, hear, and I will tell, all ye that fear God” (ver. 16). Let us come, let us hear,
what he is going to tell, “Come ye, hear, and I will tell.” But to whom, “Come ye, and hear”?
“All ye that fear God.” If God ye fear not, I will not tell. It is not possible that it be told to
any where the fear of God is not. Let the fear of God open the ears, that there may be
something to enter in, and a way whereby may enter in that which I am going to tell. But
what is he going to tell? “How great things He hath done to my soul.” Behold, he would tell:
but what is he going to tell? Is it perchance how widely the earth is spread, how much the
sky is extended, and how many are the stars, and what are the changes of sun and of moon?
This creation fulfilleth its course: but they have very curiously sought it out, the Creator
thereof have not known.2638 This thing hear, this thing receive, “O ye that fear God, how
great things He hath done to my soul:” if ye will, to yours also. “How great things He hath
done to my soul.” “To Him with my mouth I have cried” (ver. 17). “And this very thing, he
saith, hath been done to his soul; that to Him with his mouth he should cry, hath been done,
he saith, to his soul. Behold, brethren, Gentiles we were, even if not in ourselves, in our
parents. And what saith the Apostle? “Ye know, when Gentiles ye were, to idols without
speech how ye went up, being led.”2639 Let the Church now say, “how great things He hath
done to my soul.” “To Him with my mouth I have cried.” I a man to a stone was crying, to
a deaf stock I was crying, to idols deaf and dumb I was speaking: now the image of God hath
been turned to the Creator thereof. I that was “saying to a stock, My father thou art; and to
a stone, Thou hast begotten me:”2640 now say, “Our Father, which art in Heaven.”2641…“To
Him with my mouth I have cried, and I have exalted Him under my tongue.” See how in
secret He would be uncorrupt that offereth marrowed holocausts. This do ye, brethren, this
imitate, so that ye may say, “Come ye, see how great things He hath done to my soul.” For
all those things of which he telleth, by His Grace are done in our soul. See the other things
of which he speaketh.
20. “If I have beheld iniquity in my heart, may not the Lord hearken” (ver. 18). Consider
now, brethren, how easily, how daily men blushing for fear of men do censure iniquities;
He hath done ill, He hath done basely, a villain the fellow is: this perchance for man’s sake
he saith. See whether thou beholdest no iniquity in thy heart, whether perchance that which
thou censurest in another, thou art meditating to do, and therefore against him dost exclaim,
not because he hath done it, but because he hath been found out. Return to thyself, within
be to thyself a judge. Behold in thy hid chamber, in the very inmost recess of the heart, where
thou and He that seeth are alone, there let iniquity be displeasing to thee, in order that thou

2641 Matt. vi. 9.
Psalm LXVI
mayest be pleasing to God. Do not regard it, that is, do not love it, but rather despise it, that
is, contemn it, and turn away from it. Whatever pleasing thing it hath promised to allure
thee to sin; whatever grievous thing it hath threatened, to drive thee on to evil doing; all is
nought, all passeth away: it is worthy to be despised, in order that it may be trampled upon;
not to be eyed lest it be accepted.2642…
21. “Therefore God hath hearkened to me” (ver. 19). Because I have not beheld iniquity
in my heart. “And He hath listened to the voice of my prayer.” “Blessed be my God, that
hath not thrust away my supplication and His mercy from me” (ver. 20). Gather the sense
from that place, where he saith, “Come ye, hear, and I will tell you, all ye that fear God, how
great things He hath done to my soul:”2643 he hath both said the words which ye have heard,
and at the end thus he hath concluded: “Blessed be my God, that hath not thrust away my
supplication and His mercy from me.” For thus there arriveth at the Resurrection he that
speaketh, where already we also are by hope: yea both it is we ourselves, and this voice is
ours. So long therefore as here we are, this let us ask of God, that He thrust not from us our
supplication, and His mercy, that is, that we pray continually, and He continually pity. For
many become feeble in praying, and in the newness of their own conversion pray fervently,
afterwards feebly, afterwards coldly, afterwards negligently: as if they have become secure.
The foe watcheth: thou sleepest. The Lord Himself hath given commandment in the Gospel,
how “it behoveth men always to pray and not to faint.”2644 And he giveth a comparison
from that unjust judge, who neither feared God, nor regarded man, whom that widow daily
importuned to hear her; and he yielded for weariness, that was not influenced by pity: and
the naughty judge saith to himself, “Though neither God I fear, nor men I regard, even be-
cause of the weariness which this widow daily putteth upon me, I will hear her cause, and
will avenge her.” And the Lord saith, “If a naughty judge hath done this, shall not your
Father avenge His chosen, that to Him do cry day and night? Yea, I say unto you, He shall
make judgment of them speedily.” Therefore let us not faint in prayer. Though He putteth
off what He is going to grant, He putteth it not away: being secure of His promise, let us not
faint in praying, and this is by His goodness. Therefore he hath said, “Blessed is my God,
that hath not thrust away my supplication and His mercy from me.” When thou hast seen
thy supplication “not thrust away from thee,” be secure, that His mercy hath not been thrust
away from thee.

Psalm LXVI
Psalm LXVII.2645
1. Your Love remembereth, that in two Psalms,2646 which have been already treated of,
we have stirred up our soul to bless the Lord, and with godly chant have said, “Bless thou,
O my soul, the Lord.” If therefore we have stirred up our soul in those Psalms to bless the
Lord, in this Psalm is well said, “May God have pity on us, and bless us” (ver. 1). Let our
soul bless the Lord, and let God bless us. When God blesseth us, we grow, and when we
bless the Lord, we grow, to us both are profitable. He is not increased by our blessing, nor
is He lessened by our cursing. He that curseth the Lord, is himself lessened: he that blesseth
the Lord, is himself increased. First, there is in us the blessing of the Lord, and the con-
sequence is that we also bless the Lord. That is the rain, this the fruit. Therefore there is
rendered as it were fruit to God the Husbandman, raining upon and tilling us. Let us chant
these words with no barren devotion, with no empty voice, but with true heart. For most
evidently God the Father hath been called a Husbandman.2647 The Apostle saith, “God’s
husbandry ye are, God’s building ye are.”2648 In things visible of this world, the vine is not
a building, and a building is not a vineyard: but we are the vineyard of the Lord, because
He tilleth us for fruit; the building of God we are, since He who tilleth us, dwelleth in us.
And what saith the same Apostle? “I have planted, Apollos hath watered, but the increase
God hath given. Therefore neither he that planteth is anything, nor he that watereth, but
He that giveth the increase, even God.” 2649 He it is therefore that giveth the increase. Are
those perchance the husbandmen? For a husbandman he is called that planteth, that watereth:
but the Apostle hath said, “I have planted, Apollos hath watered.” Do we enquire whence
himself hath done this? The Apostle maketh answer, “Yet not I, but the Grace of God with
me.”2650 Therefore whithersoever thou turn thee, whether through Angels, thou wilt find
God thy Husbandman; whether through Prophets, the Same is thy Husbandman; whether
through Apostles, the very Same acknowledge to be thy Husbandman. What then of us?
Perchance we are the labourers of that Husbandman, and this too with powers imparted by
Himself, and by Grace granted by Himself.…
2. “Lighten His countenance upon us.” Thou wast perchance going to enquire, what is
“bless us”? In many ways men would have themselves to be blessed of God: one would have
himself to be blessed, so that he may have a house full of the necessary things of this life;
another desireth himself to be blessed, so that he may obtain soundness of body without

flaw; another would have himself to be blessed, if perchance he is sick, so that he may acquire
soundness; another longing for sons, and perchance being sorrowful because none are born,
would have himself to be blessed so that he may have posterity. And who could number the
divers wishes of men desiring themselves to be blessed of the Lord God? But which of us
would say, that it was no blessing of God, if either husbandry should bring him fruit, or if
any man’s house should abound in plenty of things temporal, or if the very bodily health
be either so maintained that it be not lost, or, if lost, be regained?…
3. “Every soul that is blessed is simple,”2651 not cleaving to things earthly nor with glued
wings grovelling, but beaming with the brightness of virtues, on the twin wings of twin love
doth spring into the free air; and seeth how from her is withdrawn that whereon she was
treading, not that whereon she was resting, and she saith securely, “The Lord hath given,
the Lord hath taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord, so hath been done: be the name of
the Lord blessed.”…But let not perchance any weak man say, when shall I be of so great
virtue, as was holy Job? The mightiness of the tree thou wonderest at, because but now thou
hast been born: this great tree, whereat thou wonderest, under the branches and shade
whereof thou coolest thyself, hath been a switch. But dost thou fear lest there be taken away
from thee these things, when such thou shalt have become? Observe that they are taken
away from evil men also. Why therefore dost thou delay conversion? That which thou fearest
when good to lose, perchance if evil thou wilt lose still. If being good thou shalt have lost
them, there is by thee the Comforter that hath taken them away: the coffer is emptied of
gold; the heart is full of faith: without, poor thou art, but within, rich thou art: thy riches
with thee thou carriest, which thou wouldest not lose, even if naked from shipwreck thou
shouldest escape. Why doth not the loss, that perchance, if evil, thou wilt lose, find thee
good; forasmuch as thou seest evil men also suffer loss? But with greater loss they are stricken:
empty is the house, more empty the conscience is. Whatsoever evil man shall have lost these
things, hath nothing to hold by without, hath nothing within whereon he may rest. He fleeth
when he hath suffered loss from the place where before the eyes of men with the display of
riches he used to vaunt himself; now in the eyes of men to vaunt himself he is not able: to
himself within he returneth not, because he hath nothing. He hath not imitated the ant, he
hath not gathered to himself grains, while it was summer.2652 What have I meant by, while
it was summer? While he had quietude of life, while he had this world’s prosperity, when
he had leisure, when happy he was being called by all men, his summer it was. He should
have imitated the ant, he should have heard the Word of God, he should have gathered to-
gether grains, and he should have stored them within. There had come the trial of tribulation,
there had come upon him a winter of numbness, tempest of fear, the cold of sorrow,
2651 Prov. xi. 25, LXX.
2652 Prov. vi. 6, xxx. 25.
Psalm LXVII
whether it were loss, or any danger to his safety, or any bereavement of his family; or any
dishonour and humiliation; it was winter; the ant falleth back upon that which in summer
she hath gathered together; and within in her secret store, where no man seeth, she is re-
cruited by her summer toils. When for herself she was gathering together these stores in
summer, all men saw her: when on these she feedeth in winter, no one seeth. What is this?
See the ant of God, he riseth day by day, he hasteneth to the Church of God, he prayeth, he
heareth lection, he chanteth hymn, he digesteth that which he hath heard, with himself2653
he thinketh thereon, he storeth within grains gathered from the threshing-floor. They that
providently hear those very things which even now are being spoken of, do thus, and by all
men are seen to go forth to the Church, go back from Church, to hear sermon, to hear lection,
to choose a book, open and read it: all these things are seen, when they are done. That ant
is treading his path, carrying and storing up in the sight of men seeing him. There cometh
winter sometime, for to whom cometh it not? There chanceth loss, there chanceth bereave-
ment: other men pity him perchance as being miserable, who know not what the ant hath
within to eat, and they say, miserable he whom this hath befallen, or what spirits, dost thou
think, hath he whom this hath befallen? how afflicted is he? He measureth by himself, hath
compassion according to his own strength; and thus he is deceived: because the measure
wherewith he measureth himself, he would apply to him whom he knoweth not.…O sluggard,
gather in summer while thou art able; winter will not suffer thee to gather, but to eat that
which thou shalt have gathered. For how many men so suffer tribulation, that there is no
opportunity either to read anything, or to hear anything, and they obtain no admittance,
perchance, to those that would comfort them. The ant hath remained in her nest, let her
see if she hath gathered anything in summer, whereby she may recruit herself in winter.
4. …There is a double interpretation, both must be given: “lighten,” he saith, “Thy face
upon us,” show to us Thy countenance. For God doth not ever light His countenance, as if
ever it had been without light: but He lighteth it upon us, so that what was hidden from us,
is opened to us, and that which was, but to us was hidden, is unveiled upon us, that is, is
lightened. Or else surely it is, “Thy image lighten upon us:” so that he said this, in “lighten
Thy countenance upon us:” Thou hast imprinted Thy countenance upon us; Thou hast
made us after Thine image and Thy likeness,2654 Thou hast made us Thy coin; but Thine
image ought not in darkness to remain: send a ray of Thy wisdom, let it dispel our darkness,
and let there shine in us Thy image; let us know ourselves to be Thine image, let us hear
what hath been said in the Song of Songs, “If Thou shalt not have known Thyself, O Thou
fair one among women.”2655 For there is said to the Church, “If Thou shalt not have known
2653 Or, “at home.”
2654 Gen. i. 26.
2655 Song of Sol. i. 8.
Psalm LXVII
Thyself.” What is this? If Thou shalt not have known Thyself to have been made after the
image of God. O Soul of the Church, precious, redeemed with the blood of the Lamb im-
maculate, observe of how great value Thou art, think what hath been given for Thee. Let us
say, therefore, and let us long that He “may lighten His face upon us.” We wear His face: in
like manner as the faces of emperors are spoken of, truly a kind of sacred face is that of God
in His own image: but unrighteous men know not in themselves the image of God. In order
that the countenance of God may be lightened upon them, they ought to say what? “Thou
shalt light my candle, O Lord my God, Thou shalt light my darkness.”2656 I am in the
darkness of sins, but by the ray of Thy wisdom dispelled be my darkness, may Thy counten-
ance appear; and if perchance through me it appeareth somewhat deformed, by Thee be
there reformed that which by Thee hath been formed.
5. “That we may know on earth Thy way” (ver. 2). “On earth,” here, in this life, “we may
know Thy way.” What is, “Thy way”? That which leadeth to Thee. May we acknowledge
whither we are going, acknowledge where we are as we go; neither in darkness we can do.
Afar Thou art from men sojourning, a way to us Thou hast presented, through which we
must return to Thee. “Let us acknowledge on earth Thy way.” What is His way wherein we
have desired, “That we may know on earth Thy way”? We are going to enquire this ourselves,
not of ourselves to learn it. We can learn of it from the Gospel: “I am the Way,”2657 the Lord
saith: Christ hath said, “I am the Way.” But dost thou fear lest thou stray? He hath added,
“And the Truth.” Who strayeth in the Truth? He strayeth that hath departed from the Truth.
The Truth is Christ, the Way is Christ: walk therein. Dost thou fear lest thou die before thou
attain unto Him? “I am the Life: I am,” He saith, “the Way and the Truth and the Life.” As
if He were saying, “What fearest thou? Through Me thou walkest, to Me thou walkest, in
Me thou restest.” What therefore meaneth, “We may know on earth Thy Way,” but “we
may know on earth Thy Christ”? But let the Psalm itself reply: lest ye think that out of other
Scriptures there must be adduced testimony, which perchance is here wanting: by repetition
he hath shown what signified, “That we may know on earth Thy Way:” and as if thou wast
inquiring, “In what earth, what way?” “In all nations Thy Salvation.” In what earth, thou
art inquiring? Hear: “In all nations.” What way art thou seeking? Hear: “Thy Salvation.” Is
not perchance Christ his Salvation? And what is that which the old Symeon hath said, that
old man, I say, in the Gospel, preserved full of years even unto the infancy of the Word?2658
For that old man took in his hands the Infant Word of God. Would He that in the womb
deigned to be, disdain to be in the hands of an old man? The Same was in the womb of the
virgin, as was in the hands of the old man, a weak infant both within the bowels, and in the
2656 Ps. xviii. 28.
2657 John xiv. 6.
2658 Luke ii. 30.
Psalm LXVII
old man’s hand, to give us strength, by whom were made all things; and if all things, even
His very mother. He came humble, He came weak, but clothed with a weakness to be changed
into strength, 2659 because “though He was crucified of weakness, yet He liveth of the virtue
of God,”2660 the Apostle saith. He was then in the hands of an old man. And what saith that
old man? Rejoicing that now he must be loosed from this world, seeing how in his own hand
was held He by whom and in whom his Salvation was upheld; he saith what? “Now Thou
lettest go,” he saith, “O Lord, Thy servant in peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy Salva-
tion.”2661 Therefore, “May God bless us, and have pity on us; may He lighten His countenance
upon us, that we may know on earth Thy Way!” In what earth? “In all nations.” What Way?
“Thy Salvation.”
6. What followeth because the Salvation of God is known in all nations? “Let the peoples
confess to Thee, O God” (ver. 3); “confess to Thee,” he saith, “all peoples.” There standeth
forth a heretic, and he saith, In Africa I2662 have peoples: and another from another quarter,
And I in Galatia have peoples. Thou in Africa, he in Galatia: therefore I require one that
hath them everywhere. Ye have indeed dared to exult at that voice, when ye heard, “Let the
peoples confess to Thee, O God.” Hear the following verse, how he speaketh not of a part:
“Let there confess to Thee all peoples.” Walk ye in the Way together with all nations; walk
ye in the Way together with all peoples, O sons of peace, sons of the One Catholic Church,2663
walk ye in the Way, seeing as ye walk. Wayfarers do this to beguile their toil. Sing ye in this
Way; I implore you by that Same Way, sing ye in this Way: a new song sing ye, let no one
there sing old ones: sing ye the love-songs of your fatherland, let no one sing old ones. New
Way, new wayfarer, new song. Hear thou the Apostle exhorting thee to a new song:
“Whatever therefore is in Christ is a new creature; old things have passed away, behold they
have been made new.” A new song sing ye in the way, which ye have learned “on the earth.”
In what earth? “In all nations.” Therefore even the new song doth not belong to a part. He
that in a part singeth, singeth an old song: whatever he please to sing, he singeth an old song,
the old man singeth: divided he is, carnal he is. Truly in so far as carnal he is, so far he is
old; and in so far as he is spiritual, so far new. See what saith the Apostle: “I could not speak
to you as if to spiritual, but as if to carnal.”2664 Whence proveth he them carnal? “For while

Psalm LXVII
one saith, I am of Paul; but another, I of Apollos: are ye not,” he saith, “carnal?”2665 Therefore
in the Spirit a new song sing thou in the safe way. Just as wayfarers sing, and ofttimes in the
night sing. Awful round about all things do sound, or rather they sound not around, but
are still around; and the more still the more awful; nevertheless, even they that fear robbers
do sing.2666 How much more safely thou singest in Christ! That way hath no robber, unless
thou by forsaking the way fallest in the hands of a robber.…Why fear ye to confess, and in
your confession to sing a new song together with all the earth; in all the earth, in Catholic
peace, dost thou fear to confess to God, lest He condemn thee that hast confessed? If having
not confessed thou liest concealed, having confessed thou wilt be condemned. Thou fearest
to confess, that by not confessing canst not be concealed: thou wilt be condemned if thou
hast held thy peace, that mightest have been delivered, by having confessed. “O God, confess
to Thee all peoples.”
7. And because this confession leadeth not to punishment, he continueth and saith, “Let
the nations rejoice and exult” (ver. 4). If robbers after confession made do wail before man,
let the faithful after confessing before God rejoice. If a man be judge, the torturer and his
fear exact from a robber a confession: yea sometimes fear wringeth out confession, pain
extorteth it: and he that waileth in tortures, but feareth to be killed if he confess, supporteth
tortures as far as he is able: and if he shall have been overcome by pain, he giveth his voice
for death. Nowise therefore is he joyful; nowise exulting: before he confesseth the claw
teareth2667 him; when he hath confessed, the executioner leadeth him along a condemned
felon: wretched in every case. But “let the nations rejoice and exult.” Whence? Through that
same confession. Why? Because good He is to whom they confess: He exacteth confession,
to the end that He may deliver the humble; He condemneth one not confessing, to the end
that He may punish the proud. Therefore be thou sorrowful before thou confessest; after
having confessed exult, now thou wilt be made whole. Thy conscience had gathered up evil
humours, with boil it had swollen, it was torturing thee, it suffered thee not to rest: the
Physician applieth the fomentations of words,2668 and sometimes He lanceth it, He applieth
the surgeon’s knife by the chastisement of tribulation: do thou acknowledge the Physician’s
hand, confess thou, let every evil humour go forth and flow away in confession: now exult,
now rejoice, that which remaineth will be easy to be made whole.…“Let the nations rejoice
and exult, for Thou judgest the peoples in equity.” And that unrighteous men may not fear,
he hath added, “and the nations on the earth Thou directest.” Depraved were the nations

and crooked were the nations, perverse were the nations; for the ill desert of their depravity,
and crookedness and perverseness, the Judge’s coming they feared: there cometh the hand
of the same, it is stretched out mercifully to the peoples, they are guided in order that they
may walk the straight way; why should they fear the Judge to come, that have first acknow-
ledged Him for a Corrector? To His hand let them give up themselves, Himself guideth the
nations on the earth. But guided nations are walking in the Truth, are exulting in Him, are
doing good works; and if perchance there cometh in any water (for on sea they are sailing)
through the very small holes, through the crevices into the hold, pumping it out by good
works, lest by more and more coming it accumulate, and sink the ship, pumping it out daily,
fasting, praying, doing almsdeeds, saying with pure heart, “Forgive us our debts, as also we
forgive our debtors” 2669—saying such words walk thou secure, and exult in the way, sing
in the way. Do not fear the Judge: before thou wast a believer, thou didst find a Saviour.
Thee ungodly He sought out that He might redeem, thee redeemed will He forsake so as to
destroy? “And the nations on earth Thou directest.”
8. He exulteth, rejoiceth, exhorteth, he repeateth those same verses in exhortation.2670
“The earth hath given her fruit” (ver. 6). What fruit? “Let all peoples confess to Thee.” Earth
it was, of thorns it was full; there came the hand of One rooting them up, there came a calling
by His majesty and mercy, the earth began to confess; now the earth giveth her fruit. Would
she give her fruit unless first she were rained on? Would she give her fruit, unless first the
mercy of God had come from above? Let them read to me, thou sayest, how the earth being
rained upon gave her fruit. Hear of the Lord raining upon her: “Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.”2671 He raineth, and that same rain is thunder; it terrifieth: fear thou
Him thundering, and receive Him raining. Behold, after that voice of a thundering and
raining God, after that voice let us see something out of the Gospel itself. Behold that harlot
of ill fame in the city burst into a strange house into which she had not been invited by the
host, but by One invited she had been called;2672 called2673 not with tongue, but by Grace.
The sick woman knew that she had there a place, where she was aware that her Physician
was sitting at meat. She has gone in, that was a sinner; she dareth not draw near save to the
feet: she weepeth at His feet, she washeth with tears, she wipeth with hair, she anointeth
with ointment. Why wonderest thou? The earth hath given her fruit. This thing, I say, came
to pass by the Lord raining there through His own mouth; there came to pass the things
whereof we read in the Gospel; and by His raining through His clouds, by the sending of

Psalm LXVII
the Apostles and by their preaching the truth, the earth more abundantly hath given her
fruit, and that crop now hath filled the round world.
9. The fruit of the earth was first in Jerusalem. For from thence began the Church: there
came there the Holy Spirit, and filled full the holy men gathered together in one place;
miracles were done, with the tongues of all men they spake.2674 They were filled full of the
Spirit of God, the people were converted that were in that place, fearing and receiving the
divine shower, by confession they brought forth so much fruit, that all their goods they
brought together into a common stock, making distribution to the poor, in order that no
one might call anything his own, but all things might be to them in common, and they might
have one soul and one heart unto God. 2675 For there had been forgiven2676 them the blood
which they had shed, it had been forgiven them by the Lord pardoning, in order that now
they might even learn to drink that which they had shed. Great in that place is the fruit: the
earth hath given her fruit, both great fruit, and most excellent fruit. Ought by any means
that earth alone to give her fruit? “May there bless us God, our God, may there bless us God”
(ver. 7). Still may He bless us: for blessing in multiplication is wont most chiefly and properly
to be perceived. Let us prove this in Genesis; see the works of God: God made light,2677 and
God made a division between light and darkness: the light He called day, and the darkness
He called night. It is not said, He blessed the light. For the same light returneth and changeth
by days and nights. He calleth the sky the firmament between waters and waters: it is not
said, He blessed the sky: He severed the sea from the dry land, and named both, the dry land
earth, and the gathering together of the waters sea: neither here is it said, God blessed.…
10. How should we will that to us He come? By living well, by doing well. Let not things
past please us; things present not hold us; let us not “close the ear” as it were with tail,2678
let us not press down the ear on the ground; lest by things past we be kept back from hearing,
lest by things present we be entangled and prevented from meditating on things future; let
us reach forth unto those things which are before, let us forget things past.2679 And that for
which now we toil, for which now we groan, for which now we sigh, of which now we speak,
which in part, however small soever, we perceive, and to receive are not able, we shall receive,
we shall thoroughly enjoy in the resurrection of the just. Our youth shall be renewed as an

eagle’s,2680 if only our old man we break2681 against the Rock of Christ. Whether those
things be true, brethren, which are said of the serpent, or those which are said of the eagle,
or whether it be rather a tale of men than truth, truth is nevertheless in the Scriptures, and
not without reason the Scriptures have spoken of this: let us do whatever it signifieth, and
not toil to discover how far that is true. Be thou such an one, as that thy youth may be able
to be renewed as an eagle’s. And know thou that it cannot be renewed, except thine old man
on the Rock shall have been broken off: that is, except by the aid of the Rock, except by the
aid of Christ, thou wilt not be able to be renewed. Do not thou because of the pleasantness
of the past life be deaf to the word of God: do not by things present be so held and entangled,
as to say, I have no leisure to read, I have no leisure to hear. This is to press down the ear
upon the ground. Do thou therefore not be such an one: but be such an one as on the other
side thou findest, that is, so that thou forget things past, unto things before reach thyself
out, in order that thine old man on the Rock thou mayest break off. And if any comparisons
shall have been made for thee, if thou hast found them in the Scriptures, believe: if thou
shalt not have found them spoken of except by report, do not very much believe them.2682
The thing itself perchance is so, perchance is not so. Do thou profit by it, let that comparison
avail for thy salvation. Thou art unwilling to profit by this comparison, by some other profit,
it mattereth not provided thou do it: and, being secure, wait for the Kingdom of God, lest
thy prayer quarrel with thee. For, O Christian man, when thou sayest, Thy Kingdom come,
how sayest thou, “Thy kingdom come”?2683 Examine thy heart: see, behold, “Thy kingdom
come:” He crieth out to thee, “I come:” dost thou not fear? Often we have told Your Love:
both to preach the truth is nothing, if heart from tongue dissent: and to hear the truth is
nothing, if fruit follow not hearing. From this place exalted as it were we are speaking to
you: but how much we are beneath your feet in fear, God knoweth, who is gracious to the
humble; for the voices of men praising do not give us so much pleasure as the devotion of
men confessing, and the deeds of men now righteous. And how we have no pleasure but in
your advances, but by those praises how much we are endangered, He knoweth, whom we
pray to deliver us from all dangers, and to deign to know and crown us together with you,
saved from every trial, in His Kingdom.

Psalm LXVII
Psalm LXVIII.2684
1. Of this Psalm, the title seemeth not to need operose discussion: for simple and easy
it appeareth. For thus it standeth: “For the end, for David himself a Psalm of a Song.” But
in many Psalms already we have reminded you what is “at the end: for the end of the Law
is Christ for righteousness to every man believing:”2685 He is the end which maketh perfect,
not that which consumeth or destroyeth. Nevertheless, if any one endeavoureth to inquire,
what meaneth, “a Psalm of a Song:” why not either “Psalm” or “Song,” but both; or what is
the difference between Psalm of Song, and Song of Psalm, because even thus of some Psalms
the titles are inscribed: he will find perchance something which we leave for men more acute
and more at leisure than ourselves.…
2. “Let God rise up, and let His enemies be scattered” (ver. 1). Already this hath come
to pass, Christ hath risen up, “who is over all things, God blessed for ever,”2686 and His en-
emies have been dispersed through all nations, to wit, the Jews; in that very place, where
they practised their enmities, being overthrown in war, and thence through all places dis-
persed: and now they hate, but fear, and in that very fear they do that which followeth, “And
let them that hate Him flee from His face.” The flight indeed of the mind is fear. For in
carnal flight, whither flee they from the face of Him who everywhere showeth the efficacy
2687 of His presence? “Whither shall I depart,” saith he, “from Thy Spirit, and from Thy face
whither shall I flee?”2688 With mind, therefore, not with body, they flee; to wit, by being
afraid, not by being hidden; and not from that face which they see not, but from that which
they are compelled to see. For the face of Him hath His presence in His Church been called.…
3. “As smoke faileth, let them fail” (ver. 2). For they lifted up themselves from the fires
of their hatred unto the vapouring of pride, and against Heaven setting their mouth, and
shouting, “Crucify, Crucify,”2689 Him taken captive they derided, Him hanging they mocked:
and being soon conquered by that very Person against whom they swelled victorious, they
vanished away. “As wax melteth from the face of fire, so let sinners perish from the face of
God.” Though perchance in this passage he hath referred to those men, whose hard-
heartedness in tears of penitence is dissolved: yet this also may be understood, that he
threateneth future judgment; because though in this world like smoke, in lifting up them-
selves, that is, in priding themselves, they have melted away, there will come to them at the
last final damnation, so that from His face they will perish for everlasting, when in His own

glory He shall have appeared, like fire, for the punishment of the ungodly, and the light of
the righteous.
4. Lastly, there followeth, “And let just men be joyous, and exult in the sight of God, let
them delight in gladness” (ver. 3). For then shall they hear, “Come, ye blessed of My Father,
receive ye the kingdom.”2690 “Let them be joyous,” therefore, that have toiled, “and exult
in the sight of God.” For there will not be in this exultation, as though it were before men,
any empty boasting; but (it will be) in the sight of Him who unerringly looketh into that
which He hath granted. “Let them delight in gladness:” no longer exulting with trembling,2691
as in this world, so long as “human life is a trial upon earth.”2692 Secondly, he turneth
himself to those very persons to whom he hath given so great hope, and to them while here
living he speaketh and exhorteth: “Sing ye to God, psalm ye to His name” (ver. 4). Already
on this subject in the exposition of the Title we have before spoken that which seemed meet.
He singeth to God, that liveth to God: He psalmeth to His name, that worketh unto His
Glory. In singing thus, in psalming thus, that is, by so living, by so working, “a way make
ye to Him,” he saith, “that hath ascended above the setting.” A way make ye to Christ: so
that through the beautiful feet of men telling good tidings, 2693 the hearts of men believing
many have a way opened to Him. For the Same is He that hath ascended above the “setting:”
either because the new life of one turned to Him receiveth Him not, except the old life shall
have set by his renouncing this world, or because He ascended above the setting, when by
rising again He conquered the downfall of the body. “For The Lord is His name.” Which if
they had known, the Lord of glory they never would have crucified. 2694
5. “Exult ye in the sight of Him,” O ye to whom hath been said, “Sing ye to God, psalm
ye to the name of Him, a way make ye to Him that hath ascended above the setting,” also
“exult in the sight of Him:” as if “sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.”2695 For while ye make a
way to Him, while ye prepare a way whereby He may come and possess the nations, ye are
to suffer in the sight of men many sorrowful things. But not only faint not, but even exult,
not in the sight of men, but in the sight of God. “In hope rejoicing, in tribulation endur-
ing:”2696 “exult ye in the sight of Him.” For they that in the sight of men trouble you, “shall
be troubled by the face of Him, the Father of orphans and Judge of widows” (ver. 5). For
desolate they suppose them to be, from whom ofttimes by the sword of the Word of God2697

both parents from sons, and husbands from wives, are severed: but persons destitute and
widowed have the consolation “of the Father of orphans and Judge of widows:” they have
the consolation of Him that say to Him, “For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
but the Lord hath taken up me:”2698 and they that have hoped in the Lord, continuing in
prayers by night and by day:2699 by whose face those men shall be troubled when they shall
have seen themselves prevail nothing, for that the whole world hath gone away after Him.2700
For out of those orphans and widows, that is, persons destitute of partnership in this world’s
hope, the Lord for Himself doth build a Temple: whereof in continuation he saith, “The
Lord is in His holy place.”
6. For what is His place he hath disclosed, when he saith, “God that maketh to dwell
men of one mood in a house” (ver. 6): men of one mind, of one sentiment: this is the holy
place of the Lord. For when he had said, “The Lord is in His holy place:” as though we were
inquiring in what place, since He is everywhere wholly, and no place of corporal space
containeth Him; forthwith he hath subjoined somewhat, that we should not seek Him apart
from ourselves, but rather being of one mood dwelling in a house, we should deserve that
He also Himself deign to dwell among us. This is the holy place of the Lord, the thing that
most men seek to have, a place where in prayer they may be hearkened unto.…For as in a
great house of a man, the Lord thereof doth not abide in every place whatsoever, but in some
place doubtless more private and honourable: so God dwelleth not in all men that are in
His house (for He dwelleth not in the vessels of dishonour), but His holy place are they
whom “He maketh to dwell of one mood,” or “of one manner, in a house.” For what are
called τρόποι in Greek, by both modi and mores (moods and manners), in Latin may be in-
terpreted. Nor hath the Greek writer, “Who maketh to dwell,” but only “maketh to dwell.”
“The Lord,” then, “is in His holy place.”…
7. But to prove that by His Grace He buildeth to Himself this place, not for the sake of
the merits preceding of those persons out of whom He buildeth it, see what followeth: “Who
leadeth forth men fettered, in strength.” For He looseth the heavy bonds of sins, wherewith
they were fettered so that they could not walk in the way of the commandments: but He
leadeth them forth “in strength,” which before His Grace they had not. “Likewise men pro-
voking that dwell in the tombs:” that is, every way dead, taken up with dead works. For these
men provoke Him to anger by withstanding justice: for those fettered men perchance would
walk, and are not able, and are praying of God that they may be able, and are saying to Him,
“From my necessities lead me forth.”2701 By whom being heard, they give thanks, saying,

2699 1 Tim. v. 5.
2700 John xii. 19.
2701 Ps. xxv. 17.
Psalm LXVIII
“Thou hast broken asunder my bonds.”2702 But these provoking men that dwell in the
tombs, are of that kind, which in another passage the Scripture pointeth out, saying, “From
a dead man, as from one that is not, confession perisheth.”2703 Whence there is this saying,
“When a sinner shall have come into the depth of evil things, he despiseth.”2704 For it is
one thing to long for, another thing to fight against righteousness: one thing from evil to
desire to be delivered, another thing one’s evil doings to defend rather than to confess: both
kinds nevertheless the Grace of Christ leadeth forth in strength. With what strength, but
that wherewith against sin even unto blood they are to strive? For out of each kind are made
meet persons, whereof to construct His holy place; those being loosened, these being raised
to life. For even of the woman, whom Satan had bound for eighteen years, by His command
He loosed the bonds;2705 and Lazarus’ death by His voice He overcame.2706 He that hath
done these things in bodies, is able to do more marvellous things in characters, and to make
men of one mood to dwell in a house: “leading forth men fettered in strength, likewise men
provoking that dwell in the tombs.”2707
8. “O God, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people” (ver. 7). His going forth is
perceived, when He appeareth in His works. But He appeareth not to all men, but to them
that know how to spy out His works. For I do not now speak of those works which are
conspicuous to all men, Heaven and earth and sea and all things that in them are; but the
works whereby He leadeth forth men fettered in strength, likewise men provoking that dwell
in the tombs, and maketh them of one manner to dwell in a house. Thus He goeth forth
before His people, that is, before those that do perceive this His Grace. Lastly, there followeth,
“When Thou wentest by in the desert, the earth was moved” (ver. 8). A desert were the na-
tions, which knew not God: a desert they were, where by God Himself no law had been
given, where no Prophet had dwelled, and foretold the Lord to come. “When,” then, “Thou
wentest by in the desert,” when Thou wast preached in the nations; “the earth was moved,”
to the faith earthly men were stirred up. But whence was it moved? “For the heavens dropped
from the face of God.” Perchance here some one calleth to mind that time, when in the
desert God was going over before His people, before the sons of Israel, by day in the pillar
of cloud, by night in the brightness of fire;2708 and determineth that thus it is that “the
heavens dropped from the face of God,” for manna He rained upon His people:2709 that the

2707 Ps. lxviii. 6.
2708 Exod. xiii. 21.
2709 Exod. xvi. 15.
Psalm LXVIII
same thing also is that which followeth, “Mount Sina from the face of the God of Israel,”2710
“with voluntary rain severing God to Thine inheritance” (ver. 9), namely, the God that on
Mount Sina spake to Moses, when He gave the Law, so that the manna is the voluntary rain,
which God severed for His inheritance, that is, for His people; because them alone He so
fed, not the other nations also: so that what next he saith, “and it was weakened,” is under-
stood of the inheritance being itself weakened; for they murmuring, fastidiously loathed the
manna, longing for victuals of flesh, and those things on which they had been accustomed
to live in Egypt.2711… Lastly, all those men in the desert were stricken down, nor were any
of them except two found worthy to go into the land of promise.2712 Although even if in
the sons of them that inheritance be said to have been perfected, we ought more readily to
hold to a spiritual sense. For all those things in a figure did happen to them;2713 until the
day should break, and the shadows should be removed.2714
9. May then the Lord open to us that knock; and may the secret things of His mysteries,
as far as Himself vouchsafeth, be disclosed. For in order that the earth might be moved to
the Truth when into the desert of the Gentiles the Gospel was passing, “the Heavens dropped
from the face of God.” These are the Heavens, whereof in another Psalm is sung, “The
Heavens are telling forth the glory of God.”2715… So here also, “the Heavens dropped;” but
“from the face of God.” For even these very persons have been “saved through faith, and
this not of themselves, but God’s gift it is, not of works, lest perchance any man should be
lifted up. For of Himself we are the workmanship,”2716 “that maketh men of one mood to
dwell in a house.”2717
10. But what is that which followeth, “Mount Sina from the face of the God of Israel”?
Must there be understood “dropped;” so that what he hath called by the name of Heavens,
the same he hath willed to be understood under the name of Mount Sina also; just as we
said that those are called mountains, which were called Heavens? Nor in this sense ought
it to move us that He saith “mountain,” not mountains, while in that place they were called
“Heavens,” not Heaven: for in another Psalm also after it had been said, “The Heavens are
telling forth the glory of God:”2718 after the manner of Scripture repeating the same sense

in different words, subsequently there is said, “And the firmament telleth the works of His
hands.”2719 First he said “Heavens,” not “Heaven:” and yet afterwards not “firmaments,”
but “firmament.” For God called the firmament Heaven,2720 as in Genesis hath been written.
Thus then Heavens and Heaven, mountains and mountain, are not a different thing, but
the very same thing: just as Churches many, and the One Church, are not a different thing,
but the very same thing. Why then “Mount Sina, which gendereth unto bondage”?2721 as
saith the Apostle. Is perchance the Law itself to be understood in Mount Sina, as that which
“the Heavens dropped from the face of God,” in order that the earth might be moved? And
is this the very moving of the earth, when men are troubled, because the Law they cannot
fulfil? But if so it is, this is the voluntary rain, whereof in confirmation he saith, “Voluntary
rain God severing to Thine inheritance:” because “He hath not done so to any nation, and
His judgment He hath not manifested to them.”2722 God therefore set apart this voluntary
rain to His inheritance because He gave the Law. And “there was made weak,” either the
Law, or the inheritance. The Law may be understood to have been made weak, because it
was not fulfilled; not that of itself it is weak, but because it maketh men weak, by threatening
punishment, and not aiding through grace. For also the very word the Apostle hath used,
where he saith, “For that which was impossible of the Law, wherein it was made weak through
the flesh:”2723 willing to intimate that through the Spirit it is fulfilled: nevertheless, itself he
hath said is made weak, because by weak men it cannot be fulfilled. But the inheritance, that
is, the people, without any doubt is understood to have been made weak by the giving to
them of the Law. For “the Law came in, that transgression might abound.”2724 But that
which followeth, “But Thou hast made it perfect,” to the Law is thus referred, forasmuch as
it is made perfect, that is, is fulfilled after that which the Lord saith in the Gospel, “I have
not come to annul the Law, but to fulfil.”2725… There is in these words yet another sense:
which seemeth to me more to approve itself. For much more in accordance with the context,
grace itself is understood to be the voluntary rain,2726 because with no preceding merits of
works it is given gratis.2727 “For if grace, no longer of works: otherwise grace no longer is

grace.”2728…“But to humble men He giveth grace.”2729 And it was made weak, but Thou
hast made it perfect:” because “virtue in weakness is perfected.”2730 Some copies indeed,
both Latin and Greek, have not “Mount Sina;” but, “from the face of the God of Sina, from
the face of the God of Israel.” That is, “The Heavens dropped from the face of God:” and,
as if enquiry were made of what God, “from the face of the God,” he saith, “of Sina, from
the face of the God of Israel,” that is, from the face of the God that gave the Law to the people
of Israel. Why then “the Heavens dropped from the face of God,” from the face of this God,
but because thus was fulfilled that which had been foretold, “Blessing He shall give that hath
given the Law”?2731 The Law whereby to terrify a man that relieth on human powers;
blessing, whereby He delivereth a man that hopeth in God. Thou then, O God, hast made
perfect Thine inheritance; because it is made weak in itself, in order that it may be made
perfect by Thee.
11. “Thine animals shall dwell therein” (ver. 10). “Thine,” not their own; to Thee subject,
not for themselves free; for Thee needy, not for themselves sufficient. Lastly, he continueth,
“Thou hast prepared in Thine own sweetness for the needy, O God.” “In Thine own sweet-
ness,” not in his meetness. For the needy he is, for he hath been made weak, in order that
he may be made perfect: he hath acknowledged himself indigent, that he may be replenished.
This is that sweetness, whereof in another place is said, “The Lord shall give sweetness, and
our land shall give her fruit:”2732 in order that a good work may be done not for fear, but
for love; not for dread of punishment, but for love of righteousness. For this is true and
sound freedom. But the Lord hath prepared this for one wanting, not for one abounding,
whose reproach is that poverty: of which sort in another place is said, “Reproach to these
men that abound, and contempt to proud men.”2733 For those he hath called proud, whom
he hath called them that abound.
12. “The Lord shall give the Word” (ver. 11): to wit, food for His animals which shall
dwell therein. But what shall these animals work to whom He shall give the word? What
but that which followeth? “To them preaching the Gospel in much virtue.” With what virtue,
but with that strength wherein He leadeth forth men fettered? Perchance also here he
speaketh of that virtue, wherewith in preaching the Gospel they wrought wondrous signs.
Who then “shall give the Word to men preaching the Gospel with much virtue”? “The King,”
he saith, “of the virtues of the Beloved” (ver. 12). The Father therefore is King of the virtues

of the Son. For the Beloved, when there is not specified any person that is beloved, by a
substitution of name, of the Only Son is understood. Is not the Son Himself King of His
virtues, to wit of the virtues serving Himself? Because with much virtue the King of Virtues
shall give the Word to men preaching the Gospel, of Whom it hath been said, “The Lord of
Virtues, He is the King of Glory?” 2734 But his not having said King of Virtues, but “King
of the Virtues of the beloved,” is a most usual expression in the Scriptures, if any one observe:
which thing chiefly appeareth in those cases where even the person’s own name is already
expressed, so that it cannot at all be doubted that it is the same person of whom something
is said. Of which sort also is that which in the Pentateuch in many passages is found: “And
Moses did it, as the Lord commanded Moses.” He said not that which is usual in our expres-
sions, And Moses did, as the Lord commanded him; but, “Moses did as the Lord commanded
Moses,” as if one person were the Moses whom He commanded, and another person the
Moses who did, whereas it is the very same. In the New Testament such expressions are
most difficult to find.2735…“The King,” therefore, “of the virtues of the Beloved,” thus may
be understood, as if it were to be said, the King of His virtues, because both King of Virtues
is Christ, and the Beloved is the very same Christ. However, this sense hath not so great
urgency, as that no other can be accepted: because the Father also may be understood as
King of the virtues of His Beloved Son, to whom the Beloved Himself saith, “All Mine are
Thine, and Thine Mine.” 2736 But if perchance it is asked, whether God the Father of the
Lord Jesus Christ can be called King also, I know not whether any one would dare to withhold
this name from Him in the passage where the Apostle saith, “But to the King of ages, immor-
tal, invisible, the only God.”2737 Because even if this be said of the Trinity itself, therein is
also God the Father. But if we do not carnally understand, “O God, Thy Judgment to the
King give Thou, and Thy justice to the Son of the King:”2738 I know not whether anything
else hath been said than, “to Thy Son.” King therefore is the Father also. Whence that verse
of this Psalm, “King of the virtues of the Beloved;” in either way may be understood. When
therefore he had said, “The Lord shall give the Word to men preaching the Gospel with
much virtue:” because virtue itself by Him is ruled, and serveth Him by whom it is given;
the Lord Himself, he saith, who shall give the Word to men preaching the Gospel with much
virtue, is the King of the virtues of the Beloved.

Psalm LXVIII
13. In the next place there followeth, “Of the Beloved, and of the beauty of the House
to divide the spoils.” The repetition belongeth to eulogy.2739… But whether it be repeated,
or whether it be received as spoken once, the word which hath been set down, namely,
“Beloved,”2740 I suppose that thus must be understood that which followeth, “and of the
beauty of a house to divide the spoils;” as if there were said, “Chosen even to divide the
spoils of the beauty of a house,” that is, Chosen even for dividing the spoils. For beautiful
Christ hath made His House, that is, the Church, by dividing to Her spoils: in the same
manner as the Body is beautiful in the distribution of the members. “Spoils” moreover those
are called that are stripped off from conquered foes. What this is the Gospel adviseth us in
the passage where we read, “No one goeth into the house of a strong man to spoil his vessels,
unless first he shall have bound the strong man.”2741 Christ therefore hath bound the devil
with spiritual bonds, by overcoming death, and by ascending from Hell above the Heavens:
He hath bound him by the Sacrament of His Incarnation, because though finding nothing
in Him deserving of death, yet he was permitted to kill: and from him so bound He took
away his vessels as though they were spoils. For he was working in the sons of disobedi-
ence,2742 of whose unbelief he made use to work his own will. These vessels the Lord
cleansing by the remission of sins, sanctifying these spoils wrested from the foe laid prostrate
and bound, these He hath divided to the beauty of His House; making some apostles, some
prophets, some pastors and doctors,2743 for the work of the ministry, for the building up
of the Body of Christ. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and though all the
members of the body are many, the body is one: so also is Christ.2744 “Are all Apostles? Are
all Prophets? Are all Powers? Have all the gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do
all interpret?”2745 “But all these things worketh one and the same Spirit, dividing to each
one his own gifts, as He willeth.”2746 And such is the beauty of the house, whereto the spoils
are divided, that a lover thereof with this fairness being enkindled, crieth out, “O Lord, I
have loved the grace of Thy House.”2747
2739 He adds: “This repetition all the copies have not, and the more careful mark it with a star put before it,
which marks are called asterisks, whereby they would have to be noted, that there are not in the Septuagint
Version, but there are in the Hebrew, those words which are distinguished by such marks.”

14. Now in that which followeth, he turneth himself to address the members themselves,
whereof the beauty of the House is composed, saying, “If ye sleep in the midst of the lots,2748
wings of a dove silvered, and between the shoulders thereof in the freshness of gold” (ver.
13). First, we must here examine the order of the words, in what manner the sentence is
ended; which certainly awaiteth, when there is said, “If ye sleep:” secondly, in that which he
saith, namely, “wings of dove silvered,” whether in the singular number it must be understood
as being, “of this wing”2749 thereof, or in the plural as, “these wings.”2750 But the singular
number the Greek excludeth, where always in the plural we read it written. But still it is
uncertain whether it be these wings; or whether, “O ye wings,” so as that he may seem to
speak to the wings themselves. Whether therefore by the words which have preceded, that
sentence be ended, so that the order is, “The Lord shall give the Word to men preaching
the Gospel with much virtue, if ye sleep in the midst of the lots, O ye wings of a dove silvered:”
or by these which follow, so that the order is, “If ye sleep in the midst of the lots, the wings
of a dove silvered with snow shall be whitened in Selmon:” that is, the wings themselves
shall be whitened, if ye sleep in the midst “of the lots:” so that he may be understood to say
this to them that are divided to the beauty of the House, as it were spoils; that is, if ye sleep
in the “midst of the lots,” O ye that are divided to the beauty of the House, “through the
manifestation of the Spirit unto profit,”2751 so that “to one indeed is given through the
Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,” etc., if then ye sleep in the
midst of the lots, then the wings of a dove silvered with snow shall be whitened in Selmon.
It may also be thus: “If ye being the wings of a dove silvered, sleep in the midst of the lots,
with snow they shall be whitened in Selmon,” so as that those men be understood who
through grace receive remission of sins. Whence also of the Church Herself, is said in the
Song of Songs, “Who is She that goeth up whitened?” For this promise of God is held out
through the Prophet, saying, “If your sins shall have been like scarlet, like snow I will whiten
them.” It may also thus be understood, so that in that which hath been said, “wings of a
dove silvered,” there be understood, ye shall be, so that this is the sense, O ye that like as it
were spoils to the beauty of the house are divided, if ye sleep in the “midst of the lots,” wings
of a dove silvered ye shall be: that is, into higher places ye shall be lifted up, adhering however
to the bond of the Church. For I think no other dove silvered can be better perceived here,
than that whereof hath been said, “One is My dove.”2752 But silvered She is because with

divine sayings she hath been instructed: for the sayings of the Lord in another place are
called “silver with fire refined, purged sevenfold.”2753 Some great good thing therefore it is,
to sleep in the midst of the lots, which some would have to be the Two Testaments, so that
to “sleep in the midst of the lots”2754 is to rest on the authority of those Testaments, that is,
to acquiesce in the testimony of either Testament: so that whenever anything out of them
is produced and proved, all strife is ended in peaceful acquiescence.…
15. “Between the shoulders,” however. This is indeed a part of the body, it is a part about
the region of the heart, at the hinder parts however, that is, at the back: which part of that
dove silvered he saith is “in the greenness of gold,” that is, in the vigour of wisdom, which
vigour I think cannot be better understood than by love. But why on the back, and not on
the breast? Although I wonder in what sense this word is put in another Psalm, where there
is said, “Between His shoulders He shall overshadow thee, and under His wings thou shalt
hope:”2755 forasmuch as under wings there cannot be overshadowed anything but what
shall be under the breast. And in Latin, indeed, “between the shoulders,” perchance in some
degree of both parts may be understood, both before and behind, that we may take shoulders
to be the parts which have the head betwixt them; and in Hebrew perchance the word is
ambiguous, which may in this manner also be understood: but the word that is in the Greek,
μετ€φρενα, signifieth not anything but at the back, which is “between the shoulders.” Is
there for this reason there the greenness of gold, that is, wisdom and love, because in that
place there are in a manner the roots of the wings? or because in that place is carried that
light burden? For what are even the wings themselves, but the two commandments of love,
whereon hangeth the whole Law and the Prophets?2756 what is that same light burden, but
that same love2757 which in these two commandments is fulfilled? For whatever thing is
difficult in a commandment, is a light thing to a lover. Nor on any other account is rightly
understood the saying, “My burden is light,”2758 but because He giveth the Holy Spirit,
whereby love is shed abroad in our hearts,2759 in order that in love we may do freely that
which he that doeth in fear doeth slavishly; nor is he a lover of what is right, when he would
prefer, if so be it were possible, that what is right should not be commanded.
16. It may also be required, when it hath not been said, if ye sleep in the lots, but “in the
midst of the lots;” what this is, “in the midst of the lots.” Which expression indeed, if more

Psalm LXVIII
exactly it were translated from the Greek, would signify, “in the midst between the lots,”2760
which is in no one of the interpreters I have read: therefore I suppose, that what hath been
said signifieth much the same, to wit the expression, “in the midst of the lots.” Hence
therefore what seemeth to me I will explain. Ofttimes this word is wont to be used for
uniting and pacifying one thing and another, that they may not mutually disagree: as when
God is establishing His covenant2761 between Himself and His people, this word the Scripture
useth; for instead of that expression which is in Latin between Me and you, the Greek hath,
in the midst of Me and you. So also of the sign of Circumcision, when God speaketh to
Abraham, He saith, “There shall be a testament between Me and thee and all thy seed:”2762
which the Greek hath, in the midst of Me and thee, and the midst of thy seed. Also when
He was speaking to Noe of the bow in the clouds to establish a sign,2763 this word very often
He repeateth: and that which the Latin copies have, between Me and you, or between Me
and every living soul, and whatever suchlike expressions there are used, is found in the
Greek to be, in the middle of Me and you, which is ‡νὰ μ™σον. David also and Jonathan
establish a sign between them,2764 that they may not disagree with a difference of thought:
and that which in Latin is expressed, between both, in the middle of both, the Greek hath
expressed in the same word, which is ‡νὰ μ™σον. But it was best that in this passage of the
Psalms our translators said not, “among the lots,” which expression is more suited to the
Latin idiom; but, “in the midst of the lots,” as though “in the midst between the lots,” which
rather is the reading in the Greek, and which is wont to be said in the case of those things
which ought to have a mutual consent.…But why in the “lots”2765 the Testaments should
be perceived, though this word is Greek, and the Testament is not so named, the reason is,
because through a testament is given inheritance, which in Greek is called κληρονομία, and
an heir κληρονόμος Now κλῆρος in Greek is the term for lot, and lots according to the
promise of God are called those parts of the inheritance which were distributed to the
people.2766 Whence the tribe of Levi was commanded not to have lot among their brethren,
because they were sustained by tithes from them. For, I think, they that have been ordained
in the grades of the Ecclesiastical Ministry have been called both Clergy and Clerks, because
Matthias by lot was chosen, who we read was the first that was ordained by the Apostles.2767

Psalm LXVIII
Henceforth, because of inheritance which is given by testament, as though by that which is
made that which maketh, by the name of “lots” the Testaments themselves are signified.
17. Nevertheless, to me here another sense also occurreth, if I mistake not, to be preferred;
understanding by cleri the inheritances themselves: so that, whereas the inheritance of the
Old Testament, although in a shadow significant of the future, is earthly felicity; but the
inheritance of the New Testament is everlasting immortality; to “sleep in the midst of the
lots” is not too earnestly now to seek the former, and still patiently to look for the latter.…And
because so well they have slept, on them, as it were on wings now flieth, and with praises is
exalted, the Church: to wit, the Dove silvered, in order that by this fame of theirs, posterity
having been invited to imitate them, while in like manner the rest also sleep, there may be
added wings whereby even unto the end of the world sublimely she may be preached.
18. “While He that is above the heavens2768 distinguisheth kings over Her, with snow
they shall be made white in Selmon” (ver. 14). While He “above the heavens,” He that ascen-
ded over all heavens that He might fulfil all things, “while He distinguisheth kings over
Her,” that is, over that same “Dove silvered.” For the Apostle continueth and saith, and “He
hath Himself given some for Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some
Pastors and Teachers.”2769 For what other reason is there to distinguish kings over Her,
save for the work of the Ministry, for the edification of the Body of Christ: when she is indeed
Herself the Body of Christ? But they are called kings from ruling: and what more than the
lusts of the flesh, that sin may not reign in their mortal body to obey the desires thereof,
that they yield not their members instruments of iniquity unto sin, but yield themselves to
God, as though from the dead living, and their members instruments of righteousness to
God?2770 For thus shall the kings be distinguished from foreigners, because they draw not
the yoke with unbelievers: secondly, in a peaceful manner being distinguished from one
another by their proper gifts. For not all are Apostles, or all Prophets, or all Teachers, or all
have gifts of healings, or all with tongues do speak, or all interpret.2771 “But all these things
worketh one and the same Spirit, dividing proper gifts to each one as He willeth.”2772 In
giving which Spirit He that is above the Heavens distinguisheth kings over the Dove silvered.
Of which Holy Spirit, when, sent to His Mother full of grace, the Angel was speaking, to her
enquiring in what manner it could come to pass that she was announced as going to bear,
seeing she knew not a man:2773…he saith, “The Holy Spirit shall come over upon thee, and

the virtue of the Most Highest shall overshadow thee,” that is, shall make a shadow for thee,
“wherefore that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.”2774
That “shadow” again is understood of a defence against the heat of carnal lusts: whence not
in carnal concupiscence, but in spiritual belief, the Virgin conceived Christ. But the shadow
consisteth of light and body: and further, The “Word” that “was in the beginning,”2775 that
true Light,2776 in order that a noonday shadow might be made for us; “the Word,” I say,
“was made Flesh, and dwelled in us.”2777…
19. But this mountain he calleth the “mountain of God, a mountain fruitful, a mountain
full of curds” (ver. 15), or “a mountain fat.” But here what else would he call fat but fruitful?
For there is also a mountain called by that name, that is to say, Selmon. But what mountain
ought we to understand by “the mountain of God, a mountain fruitful, a mountain full of
curds,” but the same Lord Christ? Of whom also another Prophet saith, “There shall be
manifest in the last times the mountain of the Lord prepared on the top of the moun-
tains”?2778 He is Himself the “Mountain full of curds,”2779 because of the babes to be fed
with grace as though it were with milk;2780 a mountain rich to strengthen and enrich them
by the excellence of the gifts; for even the milk itself whence curd is made, in a wonderful
manner signifieth grace; for it floweth out of the overflowing of the mother’s bowels, and
of a sweet compassion unto babes freely it is poured forth. But in the Greek the case is
doubtful, whether it be the nominative or the accusative: for in that language mountain is
of the neuter gender, not of the masculine: therefore some Latin translators have not trans-
lated it, “unto the Mountain of God,” but, “the Mountain of God.” But I think, “unto Selmon
the Mountain of God,” is better, that is, “unto” the Mountain of God which is called Selmon:
according to the interpretation which, as we best could, we have explained above.
20. Secondly, in the expression, “Mountain of God, Mountain full of curds,” Mountain
“fruitful,” let no one dare from this to compare the Lord Jesus Christ with the rest of the
Saints, who are themselves also called mountains of God.…For there were not wanting men
to call Him, some John Baptist, some Elias, some Jeremias, or one of the Prophets;2781 He
turneth to them and saith, “Why do ye imagine2782 mountains full of curds, a mountain,”

he saith, “wherein it hath pleased God to dwell therein”? (ver. 16). “Why do ye imagine?”2783
For as they are a light, because to themselves also hath been said, “Ye are the Light of the
world,”2784 but something different hath been called “the true Light which enlighteneth
every man,”2785 so they are mountains; but far different is the Mountain “prepared on the
top of the mountains.”2786 These mountains therefore in bearing that Mountain are glorious:
one of which mountains saith, “but from me far be it to glory, save in the Cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, through whom to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world:”2787
so that “he hath glorieth, not in himself, but in the Lord may glory.”2788 “Why” then “do
ye imagine mountains full of curds,” that “Mountain wherein it hath pleased God to dwell
therein”? Not because in other men He dwelleth not, but because in them through Him.
“For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead,”2789 not in a shadow, as in the temple
made by king Solomon,2790 but “bodily,” that is, solidly and truly.…“For there is One God,
and One Mediator of God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,”2791 Mountain of mountains, as
Saint of saints. Whence He saith, “I in them and Thou in Me.”2792 “Why then do ye imagine
mountains full of curds, the mountain wherein it hath pleased God to dwell in Him?” For
those mountains full of curds that Mountain the Lord shall inhabit even unto the end, that
something they may be to whom He saith, “for without Me nothing ye are able to do.”2793
21. Thus cometh to pass that also which followeth: “The Chariot of God is of ten thou-
sands manifold:” or “of tens of thousands manifold:” or, “ten times thousand times manifold”
(ver. 17). For one Greek word, which hath there been used, μυριοπλ€σιον, each Latin inter-
preter hath rendered as best he could, but in Latin it could not be adequately expressed: for
a thousand with the Greeks is called χίλια, but μυρι€δες are a number of tens of thousands:
for one μυριὰς are ten thousands. Thus a vast number of saints and believers, who by bearing
God become in a manner the chariot2794 of God, he hath signified under this name. By
abiding in and guiding this, He conducteth it, as though it were His Chariot, unto the end,

as if unto some appointed place. For, “the beginning is Christ; secondly, that are of Christ,
at the appearing of Him; then the end.”2795 This is Holy Church: which is that which fol-
loweth, “thousands of men rejoicing.” For in hope they are joyful, until they be conducted
unto the end, which now they look for through patience.2796 For admirably, when he had
said, “Thousands of men rejoicing:” immediately he added, “The Lord is in them.” That we
may not wonder why they rejoice, “The Lord is in them.” For through many tribulations
we must needs enter into the kingdom of God,2797 but, “The Lord is in them.” Therefore
even if they are as it were sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing,2798 though not now in that same
end, to which they have not yet come, yet in hope they are rejoicing, and in tribulation patient:
for, “The Lord is in them, in Sina in the holy place.” In the interpretations of Hebrew names,
we find Sina interpreted commandment: and some other interpretations it has, but I think
this to be more agreeable to the present passage. For giving a reason why those thousands
rejoice, whereof the Chariot of God doth consist, “The Lord,” he saith, “is in them, in Sins
in the holy place:” that is, the Lord is in them, in the commandment; which commandment
is holy, as saith the Apostle: “Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment is
holy, and just, and good.”2799…
22. In the next place, turning his address to the Lord Himself, “Thou hast gone up,” he
saith, “on high, Thou hast led captivity captive, Thou hast received gifts in men” (ver. 18).
Of this the Apostle thus maketh mention, thus expoundeth in speaking of the Lord Christ:
“But unto each one of us,” he saith, “is given grace after the measure of the giving of Christ:
for which cause he saith, He hath gone up on high, He hath led captive captivity, He hath
given gifts to men.”2800…And let it not move us that the Apostle making mention of that
same testimony saith not, “Thou hast received gifts in men;” but, “He hath given gifts unto
men.” For he with Apostolic authority hath spoken thus according to the faith that the Son
is God with the Father. For in respect of this He hath given gifts to men, sending to them
the Holy Spirit, which is the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. But forasmuch as the self-
same Christ is understood in His Body which is the Church, wherefore also His members
are His saints and believers, whence to them is said, “But ye are the Body of Christ, and the
members,”2801 doubtless He hath Himself also received gifts in men. Now Christ hath gone
up on high, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father:2802 but unless He were here also on

the earth, He would not thence have cried, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”2803 When
the Same saith Himself, “Inasmuch as to one of My least ye have done it, to Me ye have done
it:”2804 why do we doubt that He receiveth in His members, the gifts which the members
of Him receive?
23. But what is, “Thou hast led captivity captive”? Is it because He hath conquered death,
which was holding captive those over whom it reigned? Or hath he called men themselves
captivity, who were being held captive under the devil? Which thing’s mystery even the title
of that Psalm2805 doth contain, to wit, “when the house was being builded after the captivity:”
that is, the Church after the coming in of the Gentiles. Calling therefore those very men
who were being held captive a captivity, as when “the service”2806 is spoken of there are
understood those that serve also, that same captivity he saith by Christ hath been led captive.
For why should not captivity be happy, if even for a good purpose men may be caught?
Whence to Peter hath been said, “From henceforth thou shalt catch men.”2807 Led captive
therefore they are because caught, and caught because subjugated, being sent under that
gentle yoke,2808 being delivered from sin whereof they were servants, and being made servants
of righteousness2809 whereof they were children. Whence also He is Himself in them, that
hath given gifts to men, and hath received gifts in men. And thus in that captivity, in that
servitude, in that chariot, under that yoke, there are not thousands of men lamenting, but
thousands of men rejoicing. For the Lord is in them, in Sina, in the holy place.2810…
24. But what next doth he adjoin? “For they that believe not to dwell” (ver. 18): or, as
some copies have, “For not believing to dwell:” for what else are men not believing, but they
that believe not? To whom this hath been said, is not easy to perceive. For as though a
reason were being given of the above words, when it had been said, “Thou hast led captivity
captive, Thou hast received gifts in men:” there hath been added in continuation, “for they
that believe not to dwell,” that is, not believing that they should dwell. What is this? Of
whom saith he this? Did that captivity, before it passed into a good captivity, show whence
it was an evil captivity? For through not believing they were possessed by the enemy, “that
worketh in the sons of unbelief: among whom ye were sometime, while ye were living among

them.”2811 By the gifts therefore of His grace, He that hath received gifts in men, hath led
captive that captivity. For they believed not that they should dwell. For faith hath thence
delivered them, in order that now believing they may dwell in the House of God, even they
too becoming the House of God, and the Chariot of God, consisting of thousands of men
rejoicing.
25. Whence he that was singing of these things, in the Spirit foreseeing them, even he
too being fulfilled with joy hath burst forth2812 a hymn, saying, “The Lord God is blessed,
blessed is the Lord God from day unto day” (ver. 19). Which some copies have, “by day
daily,” because the Greeks have it thus, ἡμ™ραν καθ’ ἡμ™ραν: which more exactly would be
expressed by, “by day daily.” Which expression I think signifieth the same as that which
hath been said, to wit, “from day unto day.” For daily this He doeth even unto the end, He
leadeth captive captivity, receiving gifts in men.
26. And because He leadeth that chariot unto the end, He continueth and saith, “A
prosperous journey there shall make for us the God of our healths, our God, the God of
making men safe” (ver. 20). Highly is grace here commended. For who would be safe, unless
He Himself should make whole? But that it might not occur to the mind, Why then do we
die, if through His grace we have been made safe? immediately he added below, “and the
Lord’s is the outgoing of death:” as though he were saying, Why are thou indignant, O lot
of humanity, that thou hast the outgoing of death? Even thy Lord’s outgoing was no other
than that of death. Rather therefore be comforted than be indignant: for even “the Lord’s
is the outgoing of death.” “For by hope we have been saved: but if that which we see not we
hope for, through patience we wait for it.”2813 Patiently therefore even death itself let us
suffer, by the example of Him, who though by no sin He was debtor to death, and was the
Lord, from whom no one could take away life, but Himself laid it down of Himself, yet had
Himself the outgoing of death.
27. “Nevertheless, God shall break in pieces the heads of His enemies, the scalp of hair
of men walking on in their transgressions” (ver. 21): that is, too much exalting themselves,
being too proud in their transgressions: wherein at least they ought to be humble, saying,
“O Lord, be Thou merciful to me a sinner.”2814 But He shall break in pieces their heads: for
he that exalteth himself shall be humbled.2815 And thus though even of the Lord be the
outgoing of death: nevertheless the same Lord, because He was God, and died after the flesh
of His own will, not of necessity, “shall2816 break in pieces the heads of His enemies:” not

only of those who mocked and crucified Him, and wagged their heads, and said, “If Son of
God He is, let Him come down from the Cross;”2817 but also of all men lifting up themselves
against His doctrine, and deriding His death as though it were of a man. For that very same
One of whom hath been said, “Others He saved, Himself He cannot save,”2818 is the “God
of our healths,” and is the “God of saving men:” but for an example of humility and of pa-
tience, and to efface the handwriting of our sins, He even willed that the outgoing of death
should be His own, that we might not fear that death, but rather this from which He hath
delivered us through that. Nevertheless, though mocked and dead, “He shall break2819 in
pieces the heads of His enemies,” of whom He saith, “Raise Thou me up, and I shall render
to them:”2820 whether it be good things for evil things, while to Himself He subdueth the
heads of them believing, or whether just things for unjust things, while He punisheth the
heads of them proud. For in either way are shattered and broken the heads of enemies, when
from pride they are thrown down, whether by humility being amended, or whether unto
the lowest depths of hell being hurled.
28. “The Lord hath said, Out of Basan I will be turned” (ver. 22): or, as some copies
have, “Out of Basan I will turn.” For He turneth that we may be safe, of whom above hath
been said, “God of our healths, and God of saving men.”2821 For to Him elsewhere also is
said, “O God of virtues, turn Thou us, and show Thy face, and safe we shall be.”2822 Also
in another place, “Turn us, O God of our healths.”2823 But he hath said, “Out of Basan I will
turn.” Basan is interpreted confusion. What is then, I will turn out of confusion, but that
there is confounded because of his sins, he that is praying of the mercy of God that they
may be put away? Thence it is that the Publican dared not even to lift up his eyes to Heav-
en:2824 so, on considering himself, was he confounded; but he went down justified,2825 be-
cause “the Lord hath said, Out of Basan I will turn.” Basan is also interpreted drought: and
rightly the Lord is understood to turn out of drought, that is, out of scarcity. For they that
think themselves to be in plenty, though they be famished; and full, though they be altogether
empty; are not turned.…“I will turn unto the deep of the sea.” If, “I will turn,” why, “unto
the deep of the sea”? Unto Himself indeed the Lord turneth, when savingly He turneth, and

Psalm LXVIII
He is not surely Himself the deep of the sea. Doth perchance the Latin expression deceive
us, and hath there been put “unto the deep,” for a translation of what signifieth “deeply”?
For He doth not turn Himself: but He turneth those that in the deep of this world lie sunk
down with the weight of sins, in that place where one that is turned saith, “From the depths
I have cried to Thee, O Lord.”2826 But if it is not, “I will turn,” but, “I will be turned unto
the deep of the sea;” our Lord is understood to have said, how by His own mercy He was
turned even unto the deep of the sea, to deliver even those that were sinners in most desperate
case. Though in one Greek copy I have found, not, “unto the deep,” but “in the depths,”
that is, ἐν βυθοῖς: which strengtheneth the former sense, because even there God turneth
to Himself men crying from the depths. And even if He be understood Himself there to be
turned, to deliver such sort also, it is not beside the purpose: and so then He turneth, or else
to deliver them is so turned, that His foot is stained in blood. Which to the Lord Himself
the Prophet speaketh: “That Thy foot may be stained in blood” (ver. 23): that is, in order
that they themselves who are turned to Thee, or to deliver whom Thou art turned, though
in the deep of the sea by the burden of iniquity they may have been sunk, may make so great
proficiency by Thy Grace (for where there hath abounded sin, there hath superabounded
grace2827), that they may become Thy foot among Thy members, to preach Thy Gospel,
and for Thy name’s sake drawing out a long martyrdom, even unto blood they may contend.
For thus, as I judge, more meetly is perceived His foot stained in blood.
29. Lastly, he addeth, “The tongue of Thy dogs out of enemies by Himself,” calling those
very same that had been about to strive for the faith of the Gospel, even dogs, as though
barking for their Lord. Not those dogs, whereof saith the Apostle, “Beware of dogs:”2828 but
those that eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters. For having confessed
this, the woman of Canaan merited to hear, “O woman, great is thy faith, be it done to thee
as thou wilt.”2829 Dogs commendable, not abominable; observing fidelity towards their
master, and before his house barking against enemies. Not only “of dogs” he hath said, but
“of Thy dogs:” nor are their teeth praised, but their tongue is: for it was not indeed to no
purpose, not without a great mystery, that Gedeon was bidden to lead those alone, who
should lap the water of the river like dogs;2830 and of such sort not more than three hundred
among so great a multitude were found. In which number is the sign of the Cross because
of the letter T, which in the Greek numeral characters signifieth three hundred. Of such
dogs in another Psalm also said, “They shall be turned at even, and hunger they shall suffer

as dogs.”2831 For even some dogs have been reproved by the Prophet Isaiah, not because
they were dogs, but because they knew not how to bark, and loved to sleep.2832 In which
place indeed he hath shown, that if they had watched and barked for their Lord, they would
have been praiseworthy dogs: just as they are praised, of whom is said, “The tongue of Thy
dogs.”…
30. “There have been seen Thy steps, O God” (ver. 24). The steps are those wherewith
Thou hast come through the world, as though in that chariot Thou wast going to traverse
the round world; which chariot of clouds He intimateth to be His holy and faithful ones in
the Gospel, where He saith, “From this time2833 ye shall see the Son of Man coming in the
clouds.”2834 Leaving out that coming wherein He shall be Judge of quick and dead,2835
“From this time,” He saith, “ye shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds.” These “Thy
steps have been seen,” that is, have been manifested, by the revealing the grace of the New
Testament. Whence hath been said, “How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim peace,
that proclaim good things!”2836 For this grace and those steps were lying hid in the Old
Testament: but when there came the fulness of time, and it pleased God to reveal His Son,2837
that He might be proclaimed among the Gentiles, “there were seen Thy steps, O God: the
steps of my God, of the2838 King who is in the holy place.” In what holy place, save in His
Temple? “For the Temple of God is holy,” he saith, “which ye are.”2839
31. But in order that those steps might be seen, “there went before princes conjoined
with men psalming, in the midst of damsels players on timbrels” (ver. 25). The princes are
the Apostles: for they went before, that the peoples might come in multitudes. “They went
before” proclaiming the New Testament: “conjoined with men psalming,” by whose good
works that were even visible, as it were with instruments of praise, God was glorified. But
those same princes are “in the midst of damsels players on timbrels,” to wit, in an honourable
ministry: for thus in the midst are ministers set over new Churches; for this is “damsels:”
with flesh subdued praising God; for this is “players on timbrels,” because timbrels are made
of skin dried and stretched.

32. Therefore, that no one should take these words in a carnal sense, and by these words
should conceive in his mind certain choral bands of wantonness, he continueth and saith,
“In the Churches bless ye the Lord” (ver. 26): as though he were saying, wherefore, when
ye hear of damsels, players on timbrels, do ye think of wanton pleasures? “In the Churches
bless ye the Lord.” For the Churches are pointed out to you by this mystic intimation: the
Churches are the damsels, with new grace decked: the Churches are the players on the tim-
brels, with chastened flesh being spiritually tuneful. “In the Churches,” then, “bless ye the
Lord God from the wells of Israel.” For from thence He first chose those whom He made
wells. For from thence were chosen the Apostles; and they first heard, “He that shall have
drunk of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst, but there shall be made in him a
well of water springing unto life everlasting.”2840
33. “There is Benjamin the younger in a trance” (ver. 27). There is Paul the last of the
Apostles, who saith, “For even I am an Israelite, out of the seed of Abraham, out of the tribe
of Benjamin.”2841 But evidently “in a trance,” all men being amazed at a miracle so great as
that of his calling. For a trance is the mind’s going out: which thing sometimes chanceth
through fear; but sometimes through some revelation, the mind suffering separation from
the corporal senses, in order that that which is to be represented may be represented to the
spirit. Whence even thus may be understood that which here hath been written, namely,
“in a trance;” for when to that persecutor there had been said2842 from Heaven, “Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me:”2843 there being taken from him the light of the eyes of flesh, he
made answer to the Lord, whom in spirit he saw, but they that were with him heard the
voice of him replying, though seeing no one to whom he was speaking. Here also the trance
may be understood to be that one of his, whereof he himself speaking, saith, that he knew
a man caught up even unto the third Heaven; but whether in the body, or whether out of
the body, he knew not:2844 but that he being caught up into Paradise, heard ineffable words,
which it was not lawful for a man to speak. “Princes of Juda the leaders of them, princes of
Zabulon, princes of Nephthalim.” Since he is indicating the Apostles as princes, wherein is
even “Benjamin the younger in a trance,” in which words that Paul is indicated no one
doubteth; or when under the name of princes there are indicated in the Churches all men
excelling and most worthy of imitation: what mean these names of the tribes of Israel?…For
the names are Hebrew: whereof Juda is said to be interpreted confession, Zabulon habitation
of strength, Nephthalim my enlargement. All which words do intimate to us the most

proper princes of the Church, worthy of their leadership, worthy of imitation, worthy of
honours. For the Martyrs in the Churches hold the highest place, and by the crown of holy
worth they do excel. But however in martyrdom the first thing is confession, and for this is
next put on strength to endure whatsoever shall have chanced; then after all things have
been endured, straits being ended, breadth followeth in reward. It may also thus be under-
stood; that whereas the Apostle chiefly commendeth these three things, faith, hope, love;2845
confession is in faith, strength in hope, breadth in love. For of faith the substance is, that
with the heart men believe unto righteousness, but with the mouth confession be made
unto salvation.2846 But in sufferings of tribulations the thing itself is sorrowful, but the hope
is strong. For, “if that which we see not we hope for, through patience we wait for it.”2847
But breadth the shedding abroad of love in the heart doth give. For “love perfected casteth
out fear:” which fear “hath torment,”2848 because of the straits of the soul.…
34. “Command, O God, Thy Virtue” (ver. 28). For one is our Lord Jesus Christ, through
whom are all things,2849 and we in Him, of whom we read that He is “the Virtue of God
and the Wisdom of God.”2850 But how doth God command His Christ, save while He
commendeth Him? For “God commendeth His love in us, in that while yet we were sinners,
for us Christ died.”2851 “How hath He not also with Him given to us all things?”2852
“Command, O God, Thy Virtue: confirm, O God, that which Thou hast wrought in us.”
Command by teaching, confirm by aiding.
35. “From Thy Temple in Jerusalem, to Thee kings shall offer presents” (ver. 29). Jerus-
alem, which is our free mother,2853 because the same also is Thy holy Temple: from that
Temple then, “to Thee kings shall offer presents.” Whatever kings be understood, whether
kings of the earth, or whether those whom “He that is above the heavens distinguisheth over
the dove silvered;” “to Thee kings shall offer presents.” And what presents are so accept-
able2854 as the sacrifices of praise? But there is a noise against this praise, from men bearing
the name of Christian, and having diverse opinions. Be there done that which followeth,
“Rebuke Thou the beasts of the cane”2855 (ver. 30). For both beasts they are, since by not

Psalm LXVIII
understanding they do hurt: and beasts of the cane they are, since the sense of the Scriptures
they wrest according to their own misapprehension. For in the cane the Scriptures are as
reasonably perceived, as language in tongue, according to the mode of expression whereby
the Hebrew or the Greek or the Latin tongue is spoken of, or the like; that is to say, by the
efficient cause the thing which is being effected is implied. Now it is usual in the Latin lan-
guage for writing to be called style, because with the stilus it is done: so then cane also, because
with a cane it is done. The Apostle Peter saith, that “men unlearned and unstable do wrest
the Scriptures to their own proper destruction:”2856 these are the beasts of the cane,
whereof here is said, “Rebuke Thou the beasts of the cane.”
36. Concerning these also is that which followeth, “The congregation of bulls amid the
cows of the peoples, in order that there may be excluded they that have been tried with sil-
ver.”2857 Calling them bulls because of the pride of a stiff and untamed neck: for he is refer-
ring to heretics. But by “the cows of the peoples,” I think souls easily led astray must be
understood, because easily they follow these bulls. For they lead not astray entire peoples,
among whom are men grave and stable; whence hath been written, “In a people grave I will
praise Thee:”2858 but only the cows which they may have found among those peoples. “For
of these are they that steal into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who
are led with divers lusts, alway learning, and at the knowledge of the truth never arriv-
ing.”2859…For, “may be excluded,” hath been said, meaning, may appear, may stand forth:
as he saith, “may be made manifest.” Whence also, in the art of the silversmith, they are
called exclusores, who out of the shapelessness of the lump are skilled to mould the form of
a vessel. For many meanings of the holy Scriptures are concealed, and are known only to a
few of singular intelligence, and are never vindicated so suitably and acceptably as when
our diligence to make answer to heretics constraineth us. For then even they that neglect
the pursuits of learning, shaking off their slumber, are stirred up to a diligent hearing, in
order that their opponents may be refuted. In a word, how many senses of holy Scriptures
concerning Christ as God have been vindicated against Photinus, how many concerning
Christ as man against Manichæus, how many concerning the Trinity against Sabellius, how
many concerning the Unity of the Trinity against Arians, Eunomians, Macedonians? How
many concerning the Catholic Church in the whole world spread abroad, against Donatists,
and Luciferians, and others, whoever they be, that with like error dissent from the truth:
how many against the rest of heretics, whom to enumerate or mention were too long a task,
and for the present work unnecessary?…Of whom, as it were bulls, that is, not subject to

the peaceful and gentle yoke of discipline, the Apostle maketh mention, in the place where
he hath said that such an one must be chosen for the Episcopate as is “able to exhort in
sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers. For there are many unruly;”2860 these are
bulls with uplifted neck, impatient of plough and yoke: vain-talkers and leaders astray of
minds; which minds this Psalm hath intimated under the name of cows.…
37. “There shall come ambassadors out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall prevent the hands of
Him” (ver. 31). Under the name of Egypt or of Ethiopia, he hath signified the faith of all
nations, from a part the whole: calling the preachers of reconciliation ambassadors. “For
Christ,” he saith, “we have an embassy, God as it were exhorting through us: we beseech
you for Christ to be reconciled to God.” 2861 Not then of the Israelites alone, whence the
Apostles were chosen, but also from the rest of the nations that there should be preachers
of Christian peace, in this manner hath been mystically prophesied. But by that which he
saith, “shall prevent the hands of Him,” he saith this, shall prevent the vengeance of Him:
to wit, by turning to Him, in order that their sins may be forgiven, lest by continuing sinners
they be punished. Which thing also in another Psalm is said, “Let us come before2862 the
face of Him in confession.”2863 As by hands he signifieth vengeance, so by face, revelation
and presence, which will be in the Judgment. Because then, by Egypt and Ethiopia he hath
signified the nations of the whole world; immediately he hath subjoined, “to God (are) the
kingdoms of the earth.” Not to Sabellius, not to Arius, not to Donatus, not to the rest of the
bulls stiff-necked, but “to God (are) the kingdoms of the earth.” But the greater number of
Latin copies, and especially the Greek, have the verses so punctuated, that there is not one
verse in these words, “to God the kingdoms of the earth,” but, “to God,” is at the end of the
former verse, and so there is said, “Ethiopia shall come before the hands of her to God,” and
then there followeth in another verse, “Kingdoms of the earth, sing ye to God, psalm ye to
the Lord” (ver. 32). By which punctuation, doubtless to be preferred by the agreement of
many copies, and those deserving of credit, there seemeth to me to be implied faith which
precedeth works: because without the merits of good works through faith the ungodly is
justified, just as the Apostle said, “To one believing in Him that justifieth the ungodly, his
faith is counted for righteousness:”2864 in order that afterwards faith itself through love may
begin to work. For those alone are to be called good works,2865 which are done through
love of God. But these faith must needs go before, so that from thence these may begin, not

from these this.…This is faith, whereof to the Church Herself is said in the Song of Songs,
“Thou shalt come and shalt pass hence from the beginning of faith.”2866 For She hath
come2867 like the chariot of God in thousands of men rejoicing, having a prosperous course,
and She hath passed over from this world to the Father: in order that there may come to
pass in Her that which the Bridegroom Himself saith, who hath passed hence from this
world to the Father,2868 “I will that where I am, these also may be with Me:”2869 but from
the beginning of faith. Because then in order that good works may follow, faith doth precede;
and there are not any good works, save those which follow faith preceding: nothing else
seemeth to have been meant in, “Ethiopia shall come before the hands of her to God,” but,
Ethiopia shall believe in God. For thus she “shall come before the hands of her,” that is, the
works of her. Of whom, except of Ethiopia herself? For this in the Greek is not ambiguous:
for the word “of her”2870 there in the feminine gender most clearly hath been put down.
And thus nothing else hath been said than “Ethiopia shall come before her hands to God,”
that is, by believing in God she shall come before her works. For, “I judge,” saith the Apostle,
“that a man is justified through faith without the works of the Law. Is He God of the Jews
only? Is He not also of the Gentiles?”2871 So then Ethiopia, which seemeth to be the utmost
limit of the Gentiles, is justified through faith, without the works of the Law.…For the ex-
pression in Greek, χεῖρα αὐτῆς, which most copies have, both of “hand of her” and “her
own hand” may be understood: but that which is uncommon in the Greek copies, χειρας
αὐτῆς, by both “hands of her” and “her own 2872 hands,” in Latin may be expressed.
38. Henceforward, as if through prophecy all things had been discoursed of which now
we see fulfilled, he exhorteth to the praise of Christ, and next He foretelleth His future Advent.
“Kingdoms of earth, sing ye to God, psalm ye to the Lord: psalm ye to God, who hath ascen-
ded above the Heaven of Heavens to the East” (ver. 33). Or, as some copies have it, “who
hath ascended above the Heaven of Heaven to the East.” In these words he perceiveth not
Christ, who believeth not His Resurrection and Ascension. But hath not “to the East,” which
he hath added, expressed the very spot; since in the quarters of the East is where He rose

again, and whence He ascended? Therefore above the Heaven of Heaven He sitteth at the
right hand of the Father. This is what the Apostle saith, “the Same is He that hath ascended
above all Heavens.”2873 For what of Heavens doth remain after the Heaven of Heaven?
Which also we may call the Heavens of Heavens, just as He hath called the firmament
Heaven:2874 which Heaven, however, even as Heavens we read of, in the place where there
is written, “and let the waters which are above the Heavens praise the name of the Lord.”2875
And forasmuch as from thence He is to come,2876 to judge quick and dead, observe what
followeth: “behold, He shall give His voice, the voice of power.”2877 He that like a lamb before
the shearer of Him was without voice,2878 “behold shall give His voice,” and not the voice
of weakness, as though to be judged; but “the voice of power,” as though going to judge. For
God shall not be hidden, as before, and in the judgment of men not opening His mouth;
but “God shall come manifest, our God, and He shall not be silent.”2879 Why do ye despair,
ye unbelieving men? Why do ye mock? What saith the evil servant? “My Lord delayeth to
come.”2880 “Behold, He shall give His voice, the voice of power.”
39. “Give ye glory to God, above Israel is the magnificence of Him” (ver. 34). Of whom
saith the Apostle, “Upon the Israel of God.”2881 For “not all that are out of Israel, are Israel-
ites:”2882 for there is also an Israel after the flesh. Whence he saith, “See ye Israel after the
flesh.”2883 “For not they that are sons of the flesh, are sons of God, but sons of promise are
counted for a seed.”2884 Therefore at that time when without any intermixture of evil men
His people shall be, like a heap purged by the fan,2885 like Israel in whom guile is not,2886
then most pre-eminent “above Israel” shall be “the magnificence” of “Him: and the virtue
of Him in the clouds.” For not alone He shall come to judgment, but with the elders of His

people:2887 to whom He hath promised that they shall sit upon thrones to judge,2888 who
even shall judge angels.2889 These be the clouds.
40. Lastly, lest of anything else the clouds be understood, he hath in continuation added,
“Wonderful is God in His saints, the God of Israel” (ver. 35). For at that time even most
truly and most fully there shall be fulfilled the name Israel itself, which is one “seeing God:”
for we shall see Him as He is.2890 “He Himself shall give virtue2891 and strength to His
people, blessed be God:” to His people now frail and weak. For “we have this treasure in
earthen vessels.”2892 But then by a most glorious changing even of our bodies, “He Himself
shall give virtue and strength to His people.” For this body is sown in weakness, shall rise
in virtue.2893 He Himself then shall give the virtue which in His own flesh He hath sent
before, whereof the Apostle saith, “the power of His Resurrection.”2894 But strength whereby
shall be destroyed the enemy death.2895 Now then of this long and difficultly understood

Psalm LXIX.2896
1. We have been born into this world, and added to the people of God, at that period
wherein already the herb from a grain of mustard seed hath spread out its branches; wherein
already the leaven, which at first was contemptible, hath leavened three measures,2897 that
is, the whole round world repeopled by the three sons of Noe:2898 for from East and West
and North and South shall come they that shall sit down with the Patriarchs,2899 while those
shall have been driven without, that have been born of their flesh and have not imitated
their faith. Unto his glory then of Christ’s Church our eyes we have opened; and that barren
one, for whom joy was proclaimed and foretold, because she was to have more sons than
she that had the husband,2900 her we have found to be such an one as hath forgotten the
reproaches and infamy of her widowhood: and so we may perhaps wonder when we chance
to read in any prophecy the words of Christ’s humiliation, or our own. And it may be, that
we are less affected by them; because we have not come at that time when these things were
read with zest, in that tribulation abounded. But again if we think of the abundance of
tribulations, and observe the way wherein we are walking (if indeed we do walk in it), how
narrow it is, and how through straits and tribulations it leadeth unto rest everlasting,2901
and how that very thing which in human affairs is called felicity, is more to be feared than
misery; since indeed misery ofttimes doth bring out of tribulation a good fruit, but felicity
doth corrupt the soul with a perverse security, and giveth place for the Devil the
Tempter—when, I say, we shall have judged prudently and rightly, as the salted victim2902
did, that “human life upon earth is trial,”2903 and that no one is at all secure, nor ought to
be secure, until he be come to that country, whence no one that is a friend goeth forth, into
which no one that is an enemy is admitted, even now in the very glory of the Church we
acknowledge the voices of our tribulation: and being members of Christ, subject to our Head
in the bond of love, and mutually supporting one another, we will say from the Psalms, that
which here we have found the Martyrs said, who were before us; that tribulation is common
to all men from the beginning even unto the end.…
2. The Title of the Psalm is: “Unto the end, in behalf of those that shall be changed, to
David himself.” Now of the change for the better hear thou; for change either is for the worse

or for the better.…That we have been changed then for the worse, to ourselves let us ascribe:
that for the better we are changed, let us praise God. “For those,” then, “that shall be changed,”
this Psalm is. But whence hath this change been made but by the Passion of Christ? The
very word Pascha in Latin is interpreted passage. For Pascha2904 is not a Greek word but a
Hebrew. It soundeth indeed in the Greek language like Passion, because π€σχειν signifieth
to suffer: but if the Hebrew expression be examined, it pointeth to something else. Pascha
doth intimate passage. Of which even John the Evangelist hath admonished us, who (just
before the Passion when the Lord was coming to the supper wherein He set forth the Sacra-
ment of His Body and Blood) thus speaketh: “But when there had come the hour, wherein
Jesus was to pass from this world to the Father.”2905 He hath expressed then the “passage”
of the Pascha. But unless He passed Himself hence to the Father, who came for our sake,
how should we have been able to pass hence, who have not come down for the sake of taking
up anything, but have fallen? But He Himself fell not; He but came down, in order that He
might raise up him that had fallen. The passage therefore both of Him and of us is hence to
the Father, from this world to the kingdom of Heaven, from life mortal to life everlasting,
from life earthly to life heavenly, from life corruptible to life incorruptible, from intimacy
with tribulations to perpetual security. Accordingly, “In behalf of them that shall be changed,”
the Psalm’s title is. The cause therefore of our change, that is, the very Passion of the Lord
and our own voice in tribulations in the text of the Psalm let us observe, let us join in
knowing, join in groaning, and in hearing, in joint-knowing, joint-groaning, let us be
changed, in order that there may be fulfilled in us the Title of the Psalm, “In behalf of them
that shall be changed.”
3. “Save me, O God, for the waters have entered in even unto my soul” (ver. 1). That
grain is despised now, that seemeth to give forth humble words. In the garden it is buried,
though the world will admire the greatness of the herb, of which herb the seed was despised
by the Jews. For in very deed observe ye the seed of the mustard, minute, dull coloured, al-
together despicable, in order that therein may be fulfilled that which hath been said, We
have seen Him, and He had neither form nor comeliness.2906 But He saith, that waters have
come in even unto His soul; because those multitudes, which under the name of waters He
hath pointed out, were able so far to prevail as to kill Christ.…Whence then doth He so cry
out, as though He were suffering something against His will, except because the Head doth
prefigure the Members? For He suffered because He willed: but the Martyrs even though
they willed not; for to Peter thus He foretold his passion: “When thou shalt be old,” He saith,
“another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wilt not.”2907 For though we desire to
2904 Non est græcum nomen.

2907 John xxi. 18.
Psalm LXIX
cleave to Christ, yet we are unwilling to die: and therefore willingly or rather patiently we
suffer, because no other passage is given us, through which we may cleave to Christ. For if
we could in any other way arrive at Christ, that is, at life everlasting, who would be willing
to die? For while explaining our nature, that is, a sort of association of soul and body, and
in these two parts a kind of intimacy of gluing and fastening together, the Apostle saith, that
“we have a House not made with hands, everlasting in the Heavens:”2908 that is, immortality
prepared for us, wherewith we are to be clothed at the end, when we shall have risen from
the dead; and he saith, “Wherein we are not willing to be stripped, but to be clothed upon,
that the mortal may be swallowed up of life.”2909 If it might so be, we should so will, he
saith, to become immortal, as that now that same immortality might come, and now as we
are it should change us, in order that this our mortal body by life should be swallowed up,
and the body should not be laid aside through death, so as at the end again to have to be
recovered. Although then from evil to good things we pass, nevertheless the very passage is
somewhat bitter, and hath the gall which the Jews gave to the Lord in the Passion, hath
something sharp to be endured, whereby they are shown that gave Him vinegar to
drink.2910…For here both sweet are temporal pleasures, and bitter are temporal tribulations:
but who would not drink the cup of tribulation temporal, fearing the fire of hell; and who
would not contemn the sweetness of the world, longing for the sweetness of life eternal?
From hence that we may be delivered let us cry: lest perchance amidst oppressions we consent
to iniquity, and truly irreparably we be swallowed up.
4. “Fixed I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance” (ver. 2). What called
the clay? Is it those very persons that have persecuted? For out of clay man hath been
made.2911 But these men by falling from righteousness have become the clay of the deep,
and whosoever shall not have consented to them persecuting and desiring to draw him to
iniquity, out of his clay doth make gold. For the clay of the same shall merit to be converted
into a heavenly form,2912 and to be made associate of those of whom saith the Title of the
Psalm, “in behalf of them that shall be changed.” But at the time when these were the clay
of the deep, I stuck in them: that is, they held Me, prevailed against Me, killed Me. “Fixed”
then “I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance.” What is this, “there is no
substance”? Can it be that clay itself is not a substance? What is then, “fixed I am”? Can it
be that Christ hath thus stuck? Or hath He stuck, and was not, as hath been said in the book
of Job, “the earth delivered into the hands of the ungodly man”?2913 Was He fixed in body,

Psalm LXIX
because it could be held, and suffered even crucifixion? For unless with nails He had been
fixed, crucified He had not been. Whence then “there is no substance”? Is that clay not a
substance? But we shall understand, if it be possible, what is, “and there is no substance,” if
first we shall have understood what is a substance. For there is substance spoken of even of
riches, as we say, he hath substance, and he hath lost substance.…
5. God is a sort of substance: for that which is no substance, is nothing at all. To be a
substance then is to be something. Whence also in the Catholic Faith against the poisons
of certain heretics thus we are builded up, so that we say, Father and Son and Holy Spirit
are of one substance. What is, of one substance? For example, if gold is the Father, gold is
also the Son, gold also the Holy Spirit. Whatever the Father is because He is God, the same
is the Son, the same the Holy Spirit. But when He is the Father, this is not what He is. For
Father He is called not in reference to Himself, but in reference to the Son: but in reference
to Himself God He is called. Therefore in that He is God, by the same He is a substance.
And because of the same substance the Son is, without doubt the Son also is God. But yet
in that He is Father, because it is not the name of the substance, but is referred to the Son;
we do not say that the Son is Father in the same manner as we say the Son is God. Thou
askest what the Father is; we answer, God. Thou askest what is the Father and the Son: we
answer, God. If questioned of the Father alone, answer thou God: if questioned of both, not
Gods, but God, answer thou. We do not reply as in the case of men, when thou inquirest
what is father Abraham, we answer a man; the substance of him serveth for answer: thou
inquirest what is his son Isaac, we answer, a man; of the same substance are Abraham and
Isaac: thou inquirest what is Abraham and Isaac, we answer not man, but men. Not so in
things divine. For so great in this case is the fellowship of substance, that of equality it al-
loweth, plurality alloweth not. If then it shall have been said to thee, when thou tellest me
that the Son is the same as the Father, in fact the Son also is the Father; answer thou, accord-
ing to the substance I have told thee that the Son is the same as the Father, not according
to that term which is used in reference to something else. For in reference to Himself He is
called God, in reference to the Father is called Son. And again, the Father in reference to
Himself is called God, in reference to the Son He is called Father. The Father as He is called
in reference to the Son, is not the Son: the Son as He is called in reference to the Father, is
not the Father: what the Father is called in reference to Himself and the Son in reference to
Himself, the same is Father and Son, that is, God. What is then, “there is no substance”?
After this interpretation of substance, how shall we be able to understand this passage of
the Psalm, “Fixed I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance”? God made man,2914
He made substance; and O that he had continued in that which God made Him! If man had
continued in that which God made him, in him would not have been fixed He whom God
2914 Gen. i. 27.
Psalm LXIX
begot. But moreover because through iniquity man fell from the substance wherein he was
made2915 (for iniquity itself is no substance; for iniquity is not a nature which God formed,
but a perverseness which man made); the Son of God came to the clay of the deep, and was
fixed; and that was no substance wherein He was fixed, because in the iniquity of them He
was fixed. “All things by Him were made, and without Him there was made nothing.”2916
All natures by Him were made, iniquity by Him was not made, because iniquity was not
made.2917 Those substances by Him were made, which praise Him. The whole creation
praising God is commemorated by the three children in the furnace,2918 and from things
earthly to things heavenly, or from things heavenly to things earthly reacheth the hymn of
them praising God. Not that all these things have sense to praise; but because all things being
well meditated upon, do beget praise, and the heart by considering creation is fulfilled to
overflowing with a hymn to the Creator. All things do praise God, but only the things which
God hath made. Do ye observe in that hymn that covetousness praiseth God? There even
the serpent praiseth God, covetousness praiseth not. For all creeping things are there named
in the praise of God: there are named all creeping things; but there are not there named any
vices. For vices out of ourselves and out of our own will we have: and vices are not a sub-
stance. In these was fixed the Lord, when He suffered persecution: in the vice of the Jews,
not in the substance of men which by Him was made.
6. “I have come into the depth of the sea, and the tempest hath made Me to sink down.”
Thanks to the mercy of Him who came into the depth of the sea, and vouchsafed to be
swallowed by the sea whale, but was vomited forth the third day.2919 He came into the depth
of the sea, in which depth we were thrust down, in which depth we had suffered shipwreck:
He came thither Himself, and the tempest made Him to sink down: for there He suffered
waves, those very men; tempests, the voices of men saying, “Crucify, Crucify.”2920 Though
Pilate said, I find not any cause in this Man why He should be killed: there prevailed the
voices of them, saying, “Crucify, Crucify.” The tempest increased, until He was made to
sink down that had come into the depth of the sea. And the Lord suffered in the hands of
the Jews that which He suffered not when upon the waters He was walking:2921 the which
not only He had not suffered Himself, but had not allowed even Peter to suffer it.

Psalm LXIX
7. “I have laboured, crying, hoarse have become my jaws” (ver. 3). Where was this?
When was this? Let us question the Gospel. For the Passion of our Lord in this Psalm we
perceive. And, indeed, that He suffered we know; that there came in waters even unto His
Soul, because peoples prevailed even unto His death, we read, we believe; in the tempest
that He was sunk down, because tumult prevailed to His killing, we acknowledge: but that
He laboured in crying, and that His jaws were made hoarse, not only we read not, but even
on the contrary we read, that He answered not to them a word, in order that there might
be fulfilled that which in another Psalm hath been said, “I have become as it were a man
not hearing, and having not in his mouth reproofs.”2922 And that which in Isaiah hath been
prophesied, “like a sheep to be sacrificed He was led, and like a lamb before one shearing
Him, so He opened not His mouth.”2923 If He became like a man not hearing, and having
not in His mouth reproofs, how did He labour crying, and how were His jaws made hoarse?
Is it that He was even then silent, because He was hoarse with having cried so much in vain?
And this indeed we know to have been His voice on the Cross out of a certain Psalm: “O
God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?”2924 But how great was that voice, or of how
long duration, that in it His jaws should have become hoarse? Long while He cried, “Woe
unto you, Scribes and Pharisees:”2925 long while He cried, “Woe unto the world because of
offences.”2926 And truly hoarse in a manner He cried, and therefore was not understood,
when the Jews said, What is this that He saith? “Hard is this saying, who is able to hear
it?”2927 We know not what He saith. He said all these words: but hoarse were His jaws to
them that understood not His words. “Mine eyes have failed from hoping in My God.” Far
be it that this should be taken of the person of the Head: far be it that His eyes should have
failed from2928 hoping in His God: in whom rather there was God reconciling the world to
Himself,2929 and Who was the Word made flesh and dwelled in us, so that not only God
was in Him, but also He was Himself God. Not so then: the eyes of Himself, our Head, failed
not from hoping in His God: but the eyes of Him have failed in His Body, that is, in His
members. This voice is of the members, this voice is of the Body, not of the Head. How then
do we find it in His Body and members?…

8. Thus “there have been multiplied above the hairs of My head they that hate Me gratis”
(ver. 4). How multiplied? So as that they might add to themselves even one out of the
twelve.2930 “There have been multiplied above the hairs of My head they that hate Me for
nought.” With the hairs of His head He hath compared His enemies. With reason they were
shorn when in the place of Calvary He was crucified.2931 Let the members accept this voice,
let them learn to be hated gratis. For now, O Christian, if it must needs be that the world
hate thee, why dost thou not make it hate thee gratis, in order that in the Body of thy Lord
and in this Psalm sent before concerning Him, thou mayest acknowledge thy own voice?
How shall it come to pass that the world hate thee gratis? If thou no wise hurtest any one,
and art still hated: for this is gratis, without cause…
9. “O God, Thou hast known mine improvidence” (ver. 5). Again out of the mouth of
the Body. For what improvidence is there in Christ? Is He not Himself the Virtue of God,
and the Wisdom of God? Doth He call this His improvidence, whereof the Apostle speaketh,
“the foolishness of God is wiser than men”?2932 Mine improvidence, that very thing which
in Me they derided that seem to themselves to be wise, Thou hast known why it was done.
For what was so much like improvidence, as, when He had it in His power with one word
to lay low the persecutors, to suffer Himself to be held, scourged, spit upon, buffeted, with
thorns to be crowned, to the tree to be nailed? It is like improvidence, it seemeth a foolish
thing; but this foolish thing excelleth all wise men. Foolish indeed it is: but even when grain
falleth into the earth, if no one knoweth the custom of husbandmen, it seemeth foolish…Im-
providence it appeareth; but hope maketh it not to be improvidence. He then spared not
Himself: because even the Father spared Him not, but delivered Him up for us all.2933 And
of the Same, “Who loved me,” saith the Apostle, “and delivered up Himself for me:”2934 for
except a grain shall have fallen into the land so that it die, fruit, He saith, it will not yield.2935
This is the improvidence. “And my transgressions from Thee are not concealed.” It is plain,
clear, open, that this must be perceived to be out of the mouth of the Body. Transgressions
none had Christ: He was the bearer of transgressions, but not the committer. “Are not
concealed:” that is, I have confessed to Thee, all my transgressions, and before my mouth
Thou hast seen them in my thought, hast seen the wounds which Thou wast to heal. But
where? Even in the Body, in the members: in those believers out of whom there was now
cleaving to Him that member, who was confessing his sins.

10. “Let them not blush in2936 Me, that wait for Thee, O Lord, Lord of virtues” (ver. 6).
Again, the voice of the Head, “Let them not blush in Me:” let it not be said to them, Where
is He on whom ye were relying? Let it not be said to them, Where is He that was saying to
you, Believe ye2937 in God, and in Me believe?2938 “Let them not blush in Me, that wait for
Thee,” O Lord, Lord of virtues. Let them not be confounded concerning Me, that seek Thee,
O God of Israel.” This also may be understood of the Body, but only if thou consider the
Body of Him not one man: for in truth one man is not the Body of Him, but a small member,
but the Body is made up of members. Therefore the full Body of Him is the whole Church.
With reason then saith the Church, “Let them not blush in Me, that wait for Thee, O Lord,
Lord of virtues.”…
11. “For because of Thee I have sustained upbraiding, shamelessness hath covered my
face” (ver. 7). No great thing is that which is spoken of in “I have sustained:” but that which
is spoken of in “for Thy sake I have sustained,” is. For if thou sustainest because thou hast
sinned; for thine own sake thou sustainest, not for the sake of God. For to you what glory
is there, saith Peter, if sinning ye are punished, and ye bear it? But if thou sustainest because
thou hast kept the commandment of God, truly for the sake of God thou sustainest; and thy
reward remaineth for everlasting, because for the sake of God thou hast sustained revil-
ings.2939 For to this end He first sustained in order that we might learn to sustain…“Shame-
lessness hath covered my face.” Shamelessness is what? Not to be confused. Lastly, it seemeth
to be as it were a fault, when we say, the man is shameless. Great is the shamelessness of the
man, that he doth not blush. Therefore shamelessness is a kind of folly. A Christian ought
to have this shamelessness, when he cometh among men to whom Christ is an offence. If
he shall have blushed because of Christ, he will be blotted out from the book of the living.
Thou must needs therefore have shamelessness when Thou art reviled because of Christ;
when they say, Worshipper of the Crucified, adorer of Him that died ill, venerator of Him
that was slain! here if thou shalt blush thou art a dead man. For see the sentence of Him
that deceiveth no one. “He that shall have been ashamed of Me before men, I will also be
ashamed of him before the Angels of God.” 2940 Watch therefore thyself whether there be
in thee shamelessness; be thou boldfaced,2941 when thou hearest a reproach concerning
Christ; yea be boldfaced. Why fearest thou for thy forehead which thou hast armed with the
sign of the Cross?…
2936 Or, “for Me.”

Psalm LXIX
12. “An alien I have become to My brethren, and a stranger to the sons of My mother”
(ver. 8). To the sons of the Synagogue He became a stranger…Why so? Why did they not
acknowledge? Why did they call Him an alien? Why did they dare to say, we know not
whence He is? “Because the zeal of Thine House hath eaten Me up:” that is, because I have
persecuted in them their own iniquities, because I have not patiently borne those whom I
have rebuked, because I have sought Thy glory in Thy House, because I have scourged them
that in the Temple dealt unseemly:2942 in which place also there is quoted, “the zeal of Thine
House hath eaten Me up.” Hence an alien, hence a Stranger; hence, we know not whence
He is. They would have acknowledged whence I am, if they had acknowledged that which
Thou hast commanded. For if I had found them keeping Thy commandments, the zeal of
Thine House would not have eaten Me up. “And the reproaches of men reproaching Thee
have fallen upon Me.” Of this testimony Paul the Apostle hath also made use (there hath
been read but now the very lesson), and saith, “Whatsoever things aforetime have been
written, have been written that we might be instructed.”2943…Why “Thee”? Is the Father
reproached, and not Christ Himself? Why have “the reproaches of men reproaching Thee
fallen upon Me”? Because, “he that hath known Me, hath known the Father also:”2944 because
no one hath reviled Christ without reviling God: because no one honoureth the Father, except
he that honoureth the Son also.2945
13. “And I have covered in fasting My Soul, and it became to Me for a reviling” (ver.
10). His fasting was, when there fell away all they that had believed in Him; because also it
was His hunger, that men should believe in Him: because also it was His thirst, when He
said to the woman, I thirst, “give Me to drink:”2946 yea for her faith He was thirsting. And
from the Cross when He was saying, “I thirst,”2947 He was seeking the faith of them for
whom He had said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”2948 But what
did those men give to drink to Him thirsty? Vinegar. Vinegar is also called old.2949 With
reason of the old man they gave to drink, because they willed not to be new. Why willed
they not to become new? Because to the title of this Psalm whereon is written, “For them
that shall be changed,” they belonged not. Therefore, “I have covered in fasting My Soul.”
Lastly, He put from Him even the gall which they offered: He chose rather to fast than to

accept bitterness. For they enter not into His Body that are embittered, 2950 whereof in an-
other place a Psalm saith, “They that are embittered shall not be exalted in themselves.”2951
Therefore, “I have covered in fasting My Soul: and it became to Me for a reviling.” This very
thing became to Me for a reviling, that I consented not to them, that is, from them I fasted.
For he that consenteth not to men seducing to evil, fasteth from them; and through this
fasting earneth reviling, so that he is upbraided because he consenteth not to the evil thing.
14. “And I have set sackcloth my garment” (ver. 11). Already before2952 we have said
something of the sackcloth, from whence there is this, “But I, when they were troubling Me,
was covering myself with sackcloth, and was humbling My Soul in fasting. I have set sackcloth
for My garment:” that is, have set against them My flesh, on which to spend their rage, I
have concealed My divinity. “Sackcloth,” because mortal the flesh was: in order that by sin
He might condemn sin in the flesh.2953 “And I have set sackcloth my garment: and I have
been made to them for a parable,” that is, for a derision. It is called a parable, whenever a
comparison is made concerning some one, when he is evil spoken of. “So may this man
perish,” for example, “as that man did,” is a parable: that is, a comparison and likeness in
cursing. “I have been made to them,” then, “for a parable.”
15. “Against Me were reviling they that were sitting in the gate” (ver. 12). “In the gate”
is nothing else but in public. “And against Me they were chanting,2954 they that were
drinking wine.” Do ye think, brethren, that this hath befallen Christ alone? Daily to Him in
His members it happeneth: whenever perchance it is necessary for the servant of God to
forbid excess of wine and luxuries in any village or town, where there hath not been heard
the Word of God, it is not enough that they sing, nay more even against him they begin to
sing, by whom they are forbidden to sing. Compare ye now His fasting and their wine.
16. “But I with My prayer with Thee,2955 O Lord” (ver. 13). But I was with Thee. But
how? With Thee by praying. For when thou art evil spoken of, and knowest not what thou
mayest do; when at thee are hurled reproaches, and thou findest not any way of rebuking
him by whom they are hurled; nothing remaineth for thee but to pray. But remember even
for that very man to pray. “But I with my prayer with Thee, O Lord. It is the time of Thy
good pleasure, O God.” For behold the grain is being buried, there shall spring up fruit. “It
is the time of Thy good pleasure, O God.” Of this time even the Prophets have spoken,
whereof the Apostle maketh mention: “Behold now the time acceptable, behold now the

day of salvation.”2956 “It is the time of Thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of Thy
mercy.” This is the time of good pleasure, “in the multitude of Thy mercy.” For if there were
not a multitude of Thy mercy, what should we do for the multitude of our iniquity? “In the
multitude of Thy mercy; Hearken to me in the truth of Thy Salvation.” Because He hath
said, “of Thy mercy,” he hath added truth also: for “mercy and truth” are all the ways of the
Lord. 2957 Why mercy? In forgiving sins. Why truth? In fulfilling the promises.
17. “Save Thou Me from the mire, that I may not stick” (ver. 14). From that whereof
above he had spoken, “Fixed I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance.”2958
Furthermore, since ye have duly received the exposition of that expression, in this place
there is nothing further for you to hear particularly. From hence he saith that he must be
delivered, wherein before he said that he was fixed: “Save Thou Me from the mire, that I
may not stick.” And he explaineth this himself: “Let Me be rescued from them that hate
Me.” They were themselves therefore the clay wherein he had stuck. But the following per-
chance suggesteth itself. A little before he had said, Fixed I am; now he saith, Save Thou Me
from the mire, that I may not stick:” whereas after the meaning of what was said before he
ought to have said, Save Thou Me from the mire where I had stuck, by rescuing Me, not by
causing that I stick not. Therefore He had stuck in flesh, but had not stuck in spirit. He saith
this, because of the infirmity of His members. Whenever perchance thou art seized by one
that urgeth thee to iniquity, thy body indeed is taken, in regard to the body thou art fixed
in the clay of the deep: but so long as thou consentest not, thou hast not stuck; but if thou
consentest, thou hast stuck. Let then thy prayer be in that place, in order that as thy body
is now held, so thy soul may not be held, so thou mayest be free in bonds.
18. “Let not the tempest of waters drown Me” (ver. 15). But already he had been drowned.
“I have come into the depth of the sea,” thou hast said, and “the tempest hath drowned
Me,”2959 thou hast said. It hath drowned after the flesh, let it not drown after the Spirit.
They to whom was said, If they shall have persecuted you in one city, flee ye into another;2960
had this said to them, that neither in flesh they should stick, nor in spirit. For we must not
desire to stick even in flesh; but as far as we are able we ought to avoid it. But if we shall
have stuck, and shall have fallen into the hands of sinners: then in body we have stuck, we
are fixed in the clay of the deep, it remaineth to entreat for the soul that we stick not, that
is, that we consent not, that the tempest of water drown us not, so that we go into the deep
of the clay. “Neither let the deep swallow Me, nor the pit close her mouth upon Me.” What

2958 Ps. lxix. 2.

Psalm LXIX
is this, brethren? What hath he prayed against? Great is the pit of the depth of human
iniquity: every one, if he shall have fallen into it, will fall into the deep. But yet if a man being
there placed confesseth his sins to his God, the pit will not shut her mouth upon him: as is
written in another Psalm, “From the depths I have cried to Thee, O Lord; Lord, hearken
unto my voice.” 2961 But if there is done in him that which another passage of Scripture
saith, “When a sinner shall have come into the depth of evil things, he will despise,”2962
upon him the pit hath shut her mouth. Why hath she shut her mouth? Because she hath
shut his mouth. He hath lost confession, really dead he is, and there is fulfilled in him that
which elsewhere is spoken of, “From a dead man, as from one that is not, there perisheth
confession.”2963…
19. “Hearken unto me, O Lord, for sweet is Thy mercy” (ver. 16). He hath given this as
a reason why He ought to be hearkened unto, because sweet is the mercy of God.…To a
man set in trouble the mercy of God must needs be sweet. Concerning this sweetness of the
mercy of God see ye what in another place the Scripture saith: “Like rain in drought, so
beautiful is the mercy of God in trouble.”2964 That which there he saith to be “beautiful,”
the same he saith here to be “sweet.” Not even bread would be sweet, unless hunger had
preceded. Therefore even when the Lord permitteth or causeth us to be in any trouble, even
then He is merciful: for He doth not withdraw nourishment, but stirreth up longing. Accord-
ingly what saith he now, “Hearken to me, O Lord, for sweet is Thy mercy”? Now do not
Thou defer hearkening, in so great trouble I am, that sweet to me is Thy mercy. For to this
end Thou didst defer to succour, in order that to me that wherewith Thou didst succour
might be sweet: but now no longer is there cause why Thou must defer; my trouble hath
arrived at the appointed measure of distress, let Thy mercy come to do the work of goodness.
“After the multitude of Thy pities have regard unto me:” not after the multitude of my sins.
20. “Turn not away Thy face from Thy child”2965 (ver. 17). And this is a commending
of humility; “from Thy child,” that is, “from Thy little one:” because now I have been rid of
pride through the discipline of tribulation, “turn not away Thy face from Thy child.” This
is that beautiful mercy of God, whereof he spake above. For in the following verse he ex-
plaineth that whereof he spake: “For I am troubled, speedily hearken Thou unto me.” What
is “speedily”? Now there is no cause why Thou must defer it: I am troubled, my affliction
hath gone before; let Thy mercy follow.

Psalm LXIX
21. “Give heed to my soul, and redeem her,” doth need no exposition: let us see therefore
what followeth. “Because of mine enemies deliver me” (ver. 18). This petition is evidently
wonderful, neither briefly to be touched upon, nor hastily to be skipped over; truly wonderful:
“Because of mine enemies deliver me.” What is, “Because of mine enemies deliver me”?…I
see no reason for this petition, “Because of mine enemies deliver me:” unless we understand
it of something else, which when I shall have spoken by the help of the Lord, He shall judge
in you, that dwelleth in you.2966 There is a kind of secret deliverance of holy men: this for
their own sakes is made. There is one public and evident: this is made because of their en-
emies, either for their punishment, or for their deliverance. For truly God delivered not the
brothers in the book of Maccabees from the fires of the persecutor.2967…But again the Three
Children openly were delivered from the furnace of fire;2968 because their body also was
rescued, their safety was public. The former were in secret crowned, the latter openly de-
livered: all however saved.…There is then a secret deliverance, there is an open deliverance.
Secret deliverance doth belong to the soul, open deliverance to the body as well. For in secret
the soul is delivered, openly the body. Again, if so it be, in this Psalm the voice of the Lord
let us acknowledge: to the secret deliverance doth belong that whereof he spake above, “Give
heed to my soul, and redeem her.” There remaineth the body’s deliverance: for on His arising
and ascending into the Heavens, and sending the Holy Ghost from above, there were con-
verted to His faith they that at His death did rage, and out of enemies they were made friends
through His grace, not through their righteousness.2969 Therefore he hath continued, “Be-
cause of mine enemies deliver me. Give heed to my soul,” but this in secret: but “because of
mine enemies deliver” even my body. For mine enemies it will profit nothing if soul alone
Thou shalt have delivered; that they have done something, that they have accomplished
something, they will believe. “What profit is there in my blood, while I go down into corrup-
tion?”2970 Therefore “give heed to my soul, and redeem her,” which Thou alone knowest:
secondly also, “because of mine enemies deliver me,” that my flesh may not see corruption.
22. “Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame” (ver. 19). What is
reproach? What is confusion? What shame? Reproach is that which the enemy casteth in
the teeth. Confusion is that which gnaweth the conscience. Shame is that which causeth
even a noble brow to blush, because of the upbraiding with a pretended crime. There is no
crime; or even if there is a crime, it doth not belong to him, against whom it is alleged: but
yet the infirmity of the human mind ofttimes is made ashamed even when a pretended crime

is alleged; not because it is alleged, but because it is believed. All these things are in the Body
of the Lord. For confusion in Him could not be, in whom guilt was not found. There was
alleged as a crime against Christians, the very fact that they were Christians. That indeed
was glory: the brave gladly received it, and so received it as that they blushed not at all for
the Lord’s name. For fearlessness had covered the face of them, having the effrontery of
Paul, saying, “for I blush not because of the Gospel: for the virtue of God it is for salvation
to every one believing.”2971 O Paul, art not thou a venerator of the Crucified? Little it is, he
saith, for me not to blush for it: nay, therein alone I glory, wherefore the enemy thinketh
me to blush. “But from me far be it to glory, save in the Cross of Jesus Christ, through whom
to me the world is crucified, and I to the world.”2972 At such a brow as this then reproach
alone could be hurled. For neither could there be confusion in a conscience already made
whole, nor shame in a brow so free. But when it was being alleged against certain that they
had slain Christ, deservedly they were pricked through with evil conscience, and to their
health confounded and converted, so that they could say, “Thou hast known my confusion.”
Thou therefore, O Lord, hast known not only my reproach but also my confusion, in certain
shame also: who, though in me they believe, publicly blush to confess me before ungodly
men, human tongue having more influence with them than promise divine. Behold ye
therefore them: even such are commended to God, not that so He may leave them, but that
by aiding them He may make them perfect. For a certain man believing and wavering hath
said, “I believe, O Lord, help Thou mine unbelief.”2973
23. “In Thy sight are all they that trouble Me” (ver. 20). Why I have reproach, Thou
knowest; why confusion, Thou knowest; why shame, Thou knowest: therefore deliver Thou
me because of mine enemies, because Thou knowest these things of me, they know not; and
thus, because they are themselves in Thy sight, not knowing these things, they will not be
able to be either confounded or corrected, unless openly Thou shalt have delivered me be-
cause of mine enemies. “Reproach my heart hath expected, and misery.” What is, “hath ex-
pected”? Hath foreseen these things as going to be, hath foretold them as going to be. For
He came not for any other purpose. If He had been unwilling to die, neither would He have
willed to be born: for the sake of resurrection He did both. For there were two particular
things known to us among mankind, but one thing unknown. For we knew that men were
born and died: that they rose again and lived for everlasting we knew not. That He might
show to us that which we knew not, He took upon Him the two things which we knew. To
this end therefore He came. “Reproach my heart hath expected and misery.” But the misery
of whom? For He expected misery, but rather of the crucifiers, rather of the persecutors,
2971 Rom. i. 16.
2972 Gal. vi. 14.
2973 Mark ix. 24.
Psalm LXIX
that in them should be misery, in Him mercy. For pitying the misery of them even while
hanging on the Cross, He saith, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”2974
What then did it profit, that I expected? That is, what did it profit that I foretold? What did
it profit that I said to this end I had come? I came to fulfil that which I said, “I waited for
one that together should be made sorrowful, and there was not; and men comforting, and
I found not:” that is, there was none. For that which in the former verse He said, “I waited
for one that together should be made sorrowful,” the same is in the following verse, “and
men comforting.” But that which in the former verse is, “and there was not;” the same in
the following verse is, “and I found not.” Therefore another sentence is not added, but the
former is repeated. Which sentence if we reconsider, a question may arise. For were His
disciples nowise made sorrowful when He was led to the Passion, when on the tree hanged,
when dead? So much were they made sorrowful, that Mary Magdalene, who first saw Him,
rejoicing told them as they were mourning what she had seen.2975 The Gospel speaketh of
these things: it is not our presumption, not our suspicion: it is evident that the disciples
grieved, it is evident that they mourned. Strange women were weeping, when to the Passion
He was being led, unto whom turning He saith, “Weep ye, but for yourselves, do not for
Me.”2976… Peter certainly loved very much, and without hesitation threw himself to walk
on the waves,2977 and at the voice of the Lord he was delivered: and though following Him
when led to the Passion, with the boldness of love, yet being troubled, thrice he denied Him.
Whence, except because an evil thing it seemed to him to die? For he was shunning that
which he thought an evil thing. This then even in the Lord he was lamenting, which he was
himself shunning. On this account even before he had said, “Far be it from Thee, O Lord,
merciful be Thou to Thyself: there shall not come to pass this thing:”2978 at which time he
merited to hear, “Satan;” after that he had heard, “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona.”
Therefore in that sorrowfulness which the Lord felt because of those for whom He prayed,
“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do:”2979 no companion He found. “And
I waited for one that together should be made sorrowful, and there was not.” There was not
at all. “And men comforting, and I found not.” Who are men comforting? Men profiting.
For they comfort us, they are the comfort of all preachers of the Truth.
24. “And they gave for My food gall, and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink”
(ver. 22). This was done indeed to the letter. And the Gospel declareth this to us. But we

must understand, brethren, that the very fact that I found not comforters, that the very fact
that I found not one that together should be made sorrowful, this was My gall, this to Me
was bitter, this was vinegar: bitter because of grief, vinegar because of their old man. For we
read, that to Him indeed gall was offered, as the Gospel speaketh; but for drink, not for
food.2980 Nevertheless, we must so take and consider that when fulfilled, which here had
been before predicted, “They gave for My food gall:” and in that very action, not only in this
saying, we ought to seek for a mystery, at secret things to knock, to enter the rent veil of the
Temple, to see there a Sacrament, both in what there hath been said and in what there hath
been done. “They gave,” He saith, “for My food gall:” not the thing itself which they gave
was food, for it was drink: but “for food they gave it.” Because already the Lord had taken
food, and into it there had been thrown gall. But He had taken Himself pleasant food, when
He ate the Passover with His disciples: therein He showed the Sacrament of His Body.2981
Unto this food so pleasant, so sweet, of the Unity of Christ, of which the Apostle maketh
mention, saying, “For one bread, One Body, being many we are;”2982 unto this pleasant
food who is there that addeth gall, except the gainsayers of the Gospel, like those persecutors
of Christ? For less the Jews sinned in crucifying Him walking on earth, than they that despise
Him sitting in Heaven. That which then the Jews did, in giving above the food which He
had already taken that bitter draught to drink, the same they do that by evil living bring
scandal upon the Church: the same do embittered heretics, “But let them not be exalted in
their own selves.”2983 They give gall after so delectable meat. But what doth the Lord? He
admitteth them not to His Body. In this mystery, when they presented gall, the Lord Himself
tasted, and would not drink.2984 If we did not suffer them, neither at all should we taste:
but because it is necessary to suffer them, we must needs taste. But because in the members
of Christ such sort cannot be, they can be tasted, received into the Body they cannot be.
“And they gave for My food gall, and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.” I was
thirsting, and vinegar I received: that is, for the faith of them I longed, and I found oldness.
25. “Let the table of them be made in their own presence for a trap” (ver. 23). Like the
trap which for Me they set, in giving Me such a draught, let such a trap be for them. Why
then, “in their own presence”? “Let the table of them be made for a trap,” would have been
sufficient. They are such as know their iniquity, and in it most obstinately do persevere: in
their own presence there is made a trap for them. These are they that, being too destructive,
“go down into Hell alive.”2985 Lastly, of persecutors what hath been said? Except that the

Lord were in us, perchance alive they had swallowed us up.2986 What is alive? Consenting
to them, and knowing that we ought not to consent to them. Therefore in their own presence
there is made a trap, and they are not amended. Even though in their own presence there
is a trap, let them not fall into it. Behold they know the trap, and thrust out foot, and bow
their necks to be caught. How much better were it to turn away from the trap, to acknowledge
sin, to condemn error, to be rid of bitterness, to pass over into the Body of Christ, to seek
the Lord’s glory! But so much prevaileth presumption of mind, that even in their own
presence the trap is, and they fall into it. “Let the eyes of them be darkened, that they see
not,”2987 followeth here: that whereas without benefit they have seen, it may chance to them
even not to see. “Let the table of them,” therefore, “be made in their own presence for a
trap.” It is not from one wishing, but from one prophesying: not in order that it may come
to pass, but because it will come to pass. This we have often remarked, and ye ought to re-
member it: lest that which the prescient mind saith in the Spirit of God, it should seem with
ill will to imprecate.…Let it then be done to them, “both for a requital and for a stumbling-
block.” And is this by any means unjust? It is just. Why? For it is “for a requital.” For not
anything would happen to them, which was not owed. “For a requital” it is done, “and for
a stumbling-block:” for they are themselves a stumbling-block to themselves. “Let the eyes
of them be darkened, that they see not, and the back of them alway bow Thou down” (ver.
24). This is a consequence. For they, whose eyes have been darkened that they see not, it
followeth, must have their back bowed down. How so? Because when they have ceased to
take knowledge of things above, they must needs think of things below. He that well heareth,
“lift up the heart,” a bowed back hath not. For with stature erect he looketh for the hope
laid up for him in Heaven; most especially if he send before him his treasure, whither his
heart followeth.2988 But, on the other hand, they perceive not the hope of future life; already
being blinded, they think of things below: and this is to have a bowed back: from which
disorder the Lord delivered that woman. For Satan hath bound her eighteen years, and her
that was bowed down2989 He raised up:2990 and because on the Sabbath He did it, the Jews
were scandalized; suitably were they scandalized at her being raised up, themselves being
bowed. “Pour forth upon them Thine anger, and let the indignation of Thine anger overtake
them” (ver. 25), are plain words: but nevertheless, in “overtake them” we perceive them as
it were fleeing. But whither are they to flee? Into Heaven? Thou art there. Into Hell? Thou

art present. Their wings they will not take to fly straight:2991 “Let the indignation of Thine
anger overtake them,” let it not permit them to escape.
26. “Let the habitation of them become forsaken”2992 (ver. 26). This is now evident. For
in the same manner as He hath mentioned not only a secret deliverance of His, saying, “Give
heed to My soul, and redeem her;”2993 but also one open after the body, adding, “because
of mine enemies deliver me:” so also to these men He foretelleth how there are to be certain
secret misfortunes, whereof a little before He was speaking.…For the blindness of the Jews
was secret vengeance: but the open was what? “Let their habitation become forsaken, and
in their tabernacles let there not be any one to inhabit.” There hath come to pass this thing
in the very city Jerusalem, wherein they thought themselves mighty in crying against the
Son of God, “Crucify, Crucify;”2994 and in prevailing because they were able to kill Him
that raised dead men. How mighty to themselves, how great, they seemed! There followed
afterwards the vengeance of the Lord, stormed was the city, utterly conquered the Jews, slain
were I know not how many thousands of men. No one of the Jews is permitted to come
thither now: where they were able to cry against the Lord, there by the Lord they are not
permitted to dwell. They have lost the place of their fury: and O that even now they would
know the place of their rest! What profit to them was Caiaphas in saying,2995 “If we shall
have let go this man thus, there will come the Romans, and take away from us both place
and kingdom”?2996 Behold, both they did not let Him go alive, and He liveth: and there
have come the Romans, and have taken from them both place and kingdom. But now we
heard, when the Gospel was being read, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have
gathered together thy sons, as a hen her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldest not?
Behold there is left to you your house forsaken.”2997…
27. Why so? “For Him whom Thou hast smitten they have themselves persecuted, and
upon the pain of my wounds they have added” (ver. 27). How then have they sinned if they
have persecuted one by God smitten? What sin is ascribed to their mind? Malice. For the
thing was done in Christ which was to be. To suffer indeed He had come, and He punished
him through whom He suffered. For Judas the traitor was punished, and Christ was crucified:
but us He redeemed by His blood, and He punished him in the matter of his price. For he
threw down the price of silver, for which by him the Lord had been sold;2998 and he knew

not the price wherewith he had himself by the Lord been redeemed.2999 This thing was done
in the case of Judas. But when we see that there is a sort of measure of requital in all men,
and that not any one can be suffered to rage more than he hath received power to do: how
have they “added,” or what is that smiting of the Lord? Without doubt He is speaking in
the person of him from whom He had received a body, from whom He had taken unto Him
flesh, that is in the person of mankind, of Adam himself who was smitten with the first death
because of his sin.3000 Mortal therefore here are men born, as born with their punishment:
to this punishment they add, whosoever do persecute men. For now here man would not
have had to die, unless God had smitten him. Why then dost thou, O man, rage more than
this? Is it little for a man that some time he is to die? Each one of us therefore beareth his
punishment: to this punishment they would add that persecute us. This punishment is the
smiting of the Lord. For the Lord smote man with the sentence: “What day ye shall have
touched it,” He saith, “with death ye shall die.”3001 Out of this death He had taken upon
Him flesh, and our old man hath been crucified together with Him.3002 By the voice of that
man He hath said these words, “Him whom Thou hast smitten they have themselves perse-
cuted, and upon the pain of My wounds they have added.” Upon what pain of wounds?
Upon the pain of sins they have themselves added. For sins He hath called His wounds. But
do not look to the Head, consider the Body; according to the voice whereof hath been said
by the Same in that Psalm, wherein He showed there was His voice, because in the first verse
thereof He cried from the Cross, “God, My God, look upon Me, why hast Thou forsaken
Me?”3003 There in continuation He saith, “Afar from My safety are the words of Mine of-
fences.”…
28. “Lay Thou iniquity upon their iniquity” (ver. 28). What is this? Who would not be
afraid? To God is said, “Lay Thou iniquity upon their iniquity.” Whence shall God lay
iniquity? For hath He iniquity to lay? For we know that to be true which hath been spoken
through Paul the Apostle, “What then shall we say? Is there anywise iniquity with God? Far
be it.”3004 Whence then, “Lay Thou iniquity upon iniquity”? How must we understand this?
May the Lord be with us, that we may speak, and because of your weariness may be able to
speak briefly. Their iniquity was that they killed a just Man: there was added another, that
they crucified the Son of God. Their raging was as though against a man: but “if they had
2999 Redemptus, Oxf. mss.; and two in Ben. redimendus, “was to be redeemed.” See note at the end of
Homilies on St. John.

known, the Lord of Glory they had never crucified.”3005 They with their own iniquity willed
to kill as it were a man: there was laid iniquity upon their own iniquity, so that the Son of
God they should crucify. Who laid this iniquity upon them? He that said, “Perchance they
will reverence My Son,”3006 Him I will send. For they were wont to kill servants sent to
them, to demand rent and profit. He sent the Son Himself, in order that Him also they might
kill. He laid iniquity upon their own iniquity. And these things did God do in wrath, or
rather in just requital? For, “May it be done to them,” He saith, “for a requital and for a
stumbling-block.”3007 They had deserved to be so blinded as not to know the Son of God.
And this God did, laying iniquity upon their iniquity; not in wounding, but in not making
whole. For in like manner as thou increasest a fever, increasest a disorder, not by adding
disorder, but by not relieving: so because they were of such sort as that they merited not to
be healed, in their very naughtiness in a manner they advanced; as it is said, “But evil men
and wicked doers advance for the worse:” 3008 and iniquity is laid upon their own iniquity.
“And let them not enter in3009 Thy righteousness.” This is a plain thing.
29. “Let them be blotted out from the book of the living” (ver. 29). For had they been
some time written therein? Brethren, we must not so take it, as that God writeth any one in
the book of life, and blotteth him out. If a man said, “What I have written I have written,”3010
concerning the title where it had been written, “King of the Jews:” doth God write any one,
and blot him out? He foreknoweth, He hath predestined all before the foundation of the
world that are to reign with His Son in life everlasting.3011 These He hath written down,
these same the Book of Life doth contain. Lastly, in the Apocalypse, what saith the Spirit of
God, when the same Scripture was speaking of the oppressions that should be from Anti-
christ? “There shall give consent3012 to him all they that have not been written in the book
of life.”3013 So then without doubt they will not consent that have been written. How then
are these men blotted out from that book wherein they were never written? This hath been
said according to their own hope, because they thought of themselves that they were written.
What is, “let them be blotted out from the book of life”? Even to themselves let it be evident,
that they were not there. By this method of speaking hath been said in another Psalm, “There

shall fall from Thy side a thousand, and tens of thousands from on Thy right hand:”3014
that is, many men shall be offended, even out of that number who thought that they would
sit with Thee, even out of that number who thought that they would stand at Thy right hand,
being severed from the left-hand goats:3015 not that when any one hath there stood, he shall
afterwards fall, or when any one with Him hath sat, he shall be cast away; but that many
men were to fall into scandal, who already thought themselves to be there, that is, many that
thought that they would sit with Thee, many that hoped that they would stand at the right
hand, will themselves fall. So then here also they that hoped as though by the merit of their
own righteousness themselves to have been written in the book of God, they to whom is
said, “Search the Scriptures, wherein ye think yourselves to have life eternal:”3016 when their
condemnation shall have been brought even to their own knowledge, shall be effaced from
the book of the living, they shall know themselves not to be there. For the verse which fol-
loweth, explaineth what hath been said: “And with just men let them not be written.” I have
said then “Let them be effaced,” according to their hope: but according to Thy justice I say
what?
30. “Poor and sorrowful I am” (ver. 30). Why this? Is it that we may acknowledge that
through bitterness of soul this poor One doth speak evil? For He hath spoken of many things
to happen to them. And as if we were saying to Him, “Why such things?”—“Nay, not so
much!” He answereth, “poor and sorrowful I am.” They have brought Me to want, unto this
sorrow they have set Me down, therefore I say these words. It is not, however, the indignation
of one cursing, but the prediction of one prophesying. For He was intending to recommend
to us certain things which hereafter He saith of His poverty and His sorrow, in order that
we may learn to be poor and sorrowful. For, “Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom
of Heaven.”3017 And, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.” This
therefore He doth Himself before now show to us: and so, “poor and sorrowful I am.” The
whole Body of Him saith this. The Body of Christ in this earth is poor and sorrowful. But
let Christians be rich. Truly if Christians they are, they are poor; in comparison with the
riches celestial for which they hope, all their gold they count for sand. “And the health of
Thy countenance, O God, hath taken Me up.” Is this poor One anywise forsaken? When
dost thou deign to bring near to thy table a poor man in rags? But again, this poor One the
health of the countenance of God hath taken up: in His countenance He hath hidden His
need. For of Him hath been said, “Thou shalt hide them in the hiding place of Thy counten-
ance.”3018 But in that countenance what riches there are would ye know? Riches here give

thee this advantage, that thou mayest dine on what thou wilt, whenever thou wilt: but those
riches, that thou mayest never hunger. “The health of Thy countenance, O God, hath taken
Me up.” For what purpose? In order that no longer I may be poor, no longer sorrowful? “I
will praise the name of the Lord with a song, I will magnify Him in praise” (ver. 31). Now
it hath been said, this poor One praiseth the name of the Lord with a song, he magnifieth
Him in praise. When would He have ventured to sing, unless He had been refreshed from
hunger? “I will magnify Him with praise.” O vast riches! What jewels of God’s praise hath
he brought out of his inward treasures! These are my riches! “The Lord hath given, the Lord
hath taken away.”3019 Then miserable he hath remained? Far be it. See the riches: “As it
hath pleased the Lord, so hath been done, be the name of the Lord blessed.”
31. “And it shall please God:” that I shall praise Him, shall please: “above a new calf,
bearing horns and hoofs.” More grateful to Him shall be the sacrifice of praise than the
sacrifice of a calf. “The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me.”3020 “Immolate to God the sacrifice
of praise.”3021 So then His praise going forth from my mouth shall please God more than
a great victim led up to His altar.…Therefore above this calf my praising shall please Thee,
such as hereafter will be, after poverty and sorrow, in the eternal society of Angels, where
neither adversary there shall be in battle to be tossed, nor sluggard from earth to be stirred
up. “Let the needy see and rejoice” (ver. 32). Let them believe, and in hope be glad. Let them
be more needy, in order that they may deserve to be filled: lest while they belch out pride’s
satiety, there be denied them the bread whereon they may healthily live. “Seek the Lord,”
ye needy, hunger ye and thirst;3022 for He is Himself the living bread that came down from
Heaven.3023 “Seek ye the Lord, and your soul shall live.” Ye seek bread, that your flesh may
live: the Lord seek ye, that your soul may live.3024
32. “For the Lord hath hearkened to the poor” (ver. 33). He hath hearkened to the poor,
and He would not have hearkened to the poor, unless they were poor. Wilt thou be hearkened
to? Poor be thou: let sorrow cry out from thee, and not fastidiousness. “And His fettered
ones He hath not despised.” Being offended at His servants, He hath put them in fetters:
but them crying from the fetters He hath not despised. What are these fetters? Mortality,
the corruptibleness of the flesh are the fetters wherewith we have been bound. And would
ye know the weight of these fetters? Of them is said, “The body which is corrupted weigheth
down the soul.”3025 Whenever men in the world will to be rich, for these fetters they are

seeking rags. But let the rags of the fetters suffice: seek so much as is necessary for keeping
off want, but when thou seekest superfluities, thou longest to load thy fetters. In such a
prison then let the fetters abide even alone. “Sufficient for the day be the evil thereof.”3026
“Let there praise Him heavens and earth, sea and all things creeping in them” (ver. 34). The
true riches of this poor man are these, to consider the creation, and to praise the Creator.
“Let there praise Him heavens and earth, sea and all things creeping therein.” And doth this
creation alone praise God, when by considering of it God is praised?
33. Hear thou another thing also: “for God shall save Sion” (ver. 35). He restoreth His
Church, the faithful Gentiles He doth incorporate with His Only-Begotten; He beguileth
not them that believe in Him of the reward of His promise. “For God shall save Sion; and
there shall be builded the cities of Juda.” These same are the Churches. Let no one say, when
shall it come to pass that there be builded the cities of Juda? O that thou wouldest acknow-
ledge the Edifice, and be a living stone, that thou mightest enter into Her. Even now the
cities of Juda are being built. For Juda is interpreted confession. By confession of humility
there are being builded the cities of Juda: in order that there may remain without the proud,
who blush to confess. “For God shall save Sion.” What Sion? Hear in the following words:
“and the seed of His servants shall possess Her, and they that love His name shall dwell
therein” (ver. 36).…

Psalm LXIX
Psalm LXX.3027
1. Thanks to the “Corn of wheat,”3028 because He willed to die and to be multiplied:
thanks to the only Son of God, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who disdained not to
undergo our death, in order that He might make us worthy of His life. Behold Him that was
single until He went hence; as He said in another Psalm, “Single I am until I go hence;”3029
for He was a single corn of wheat in such sort as that He had in Himself a great fruitfulness
of increase; in how many corns imitating the Passion of Him we exult, when we celebrate
the nativities of the Martyrs! Many therefore members of Him, under one Head our Saviour
Himself, being bound together in the bond of love and peace (as ye judge it fit that ye know,
for ye have often heard), are one man: and of the same, as of one man, the voice is ofttimes
heard, in the Psalms, and thus one crieth as though it were all, because all in one are one.…
2. There is then in this Psalm the voice of men troubled, and so indeed of Martyrs amid
sufferings in peril, but relying on their own Head. Let us hear them, and speak with them
out of sympathy of heart, though it be not with similarity of suffering. For they are already
crowned, we are still in peril: not that such sort of persecutions do vex us as have vexed
them, but worse perchance in the midsts of all kinds of so great scandals. For our own times
do more abound in that woe, which the Lord cried: “Woe to the world because of scan-
dals.”3030 And, “Because iniquity hath abounded, the love of man shall wax cold.”3031 For
not even that holy Lot at Sodom suffered corporal persecution from any one, or had it been
told him that he should not dwell there:3032 the persecution of him were the evil doings of
the Sodomites. Now then that Christ sitteth in Heaven, now that He is glorified, now that
necks of kings are made subject to His yoke, and their brows placed beneath His sign, now
that not any one remaineth to dare openly to trample upon Christians, still, however, we
groan amid instruments and singers, still those enemies of the Martyrs, because with words
and steel they have no power, with their own wantonness do persecute them. And O that
we were sorrowing for Heathens alone: it would be some sort of comfort, to wait for those
that not yet have been signed with the Cross of Christ; when they should be signed, and
when, by His authority attached, they should cease to be mad. We see besides men wearing
on their brow the sign of Him, at the same time on that same brow wearing the shamelessness
of wantonness, and on the days and celebrations of the Martyrs not exulting but insulting.
And amid these things we groan, and this is our persecution, if there is in us the love which

saith, “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I burn not?”3033 Not any
servant of God, then, is without persecution: and that is a true saying which the Apostle
saith, “But even all men that will to live godly in Christ, shall suffer persecution.”3034…
3. “O God, to my aid make speed” (ver. 1). For need we have for an everlasting aid in
this world. But when have we not? Now however being in tribulation, let us especially say,
“O God, to my aid make speed.” “Let them be confounded and fear that seek my soul.”
Christ is speaking: whether Head speak or whether Body speak; He is speaking that hath
said, “Why persecutest thou Me?” 3035 He is speaking that hath said, “Inasmuch as ye have
done it to one of the least of Mine, to Me ye have done it.”3036 The voice then of this Man
is known to be of the whole man, of Head and of Body: that need not often be mentioned,
because it is known. “Be they confounded,” he saith, “and fear that seek my soul.” In another
Psalm He saith, “I was looking unto the right and saw, and there was not one that would
know Me: flight hath perished from Me, and there is not one to seek out My soul.”3037 There
of persecutors He saith, that there was not one to seek out His soul: but here, “Let them be
confounded and fear that seek My soul.”…And where is that which thou hast heard from
thy Lord, “Love ye your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that
persecute you”?3038 Behold thou sufferest persecution, and cursest them from whom thou
sufferest: how dost thou imitate the Passions of thy Lord that have gone before, hanging on
the cross and saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”3039 To persons
saying such things the Martyr replieth and saith, thou hast set before me the Lord, saying,
“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do:” understand thou my voice also, in
order that it may be thine too: for what have I said concerning mine enemies? “Let them be
confounded and fear.” Already such vengeance hath been taken on the enemies of the
Martyrs. That Saul that persecuted Stephen, he was confounded and feared. He was
breathing out slaughters, 3040 he was seeking some to drag and slay: a voice having been
heard from above, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me,”3041 he was confounded and laid
low, and he was raised up to obedience, that had been inflamed unto persecuting. This then
the Martyrs desire for their enemies, “Let them be confounded and fear.” For so long as

they are not confounded and fear, they must needs defend their actions: glorious they think
themselves, because they hold, because they bind, because they scourge, because they kill,
because they dance, because they insult, and because of all these doings they be some time
confounded and fear.3042 For if they be confounded, they will also be converted: because
converted they cannot be, unless they shall have been confounded and shall have feared.
Let us then wish these things to our enemies, let us wish them without fear. Behold I have
said, and let me have said it with you, may all that still dance and sing and insult the Martyrs
“be confounded and fear:” at last within these walls confounded may they beat their breasts!
4. “Let them be turned away backward and blush that think evil things to me” (ver. 2).
At first there was the assault of them persecuting, now there hath remained the malice of
them thinking. In fact, there are in the Church distinct seasons of persecutions following
one another.3043 There was made an assault on the Church when kings were persecuting:
and because kings had been foretold as to persecute and as to believe, when one had been
fulfilled the other was to follow. There came to pass also that which was consequent; kings
believed, peace was given to the Church, the Church began to be set in the highest place of
dignity, even on this earth, even in this life: but there is not wanting the roar of persecutors,
they have turned their assaults into thoughts. In these thoughts, as in a bottomless pit, the
devil hath been bound,3044 he roareth and breaketh not forth. For it hath been said concern-
ing these times of the Church, “The sinner shall see, and shall be angry.”3045 And shall do
what? That which he did at first? Drag, bind, smite? He doeth not this. What then? “With
his teeth he shall gnash, and shall pine away.” And with these men the Martyr is, as it were,
angry, and yet for these men the Martyr prayeth. For in like manner as he hath wished well
to those men concerning whom he hath said, “Let them be confounded and fear that seek
my soul:”3046 so also now, “Let them be turned backward, and blush, that think evil things
to me.” Wherefore? In order that they may not go before, but follow. For he that censureth
the Christian religion, and on his own system willeth to live, willeth as it were to go before
Christ, as though He indeed had erred and had been weak and infirm, because He either
willed to suffer or could suffer in the hands of the Jews; but that he is a clever man for
guarding against all these things; in shunning death, even in basely lying to escape death,
and slaying his soul that he may live in body, he thinketh himself a man of singular and
prudent measures. He goeth before in censuring Christ, in a manner he outstrippeth Christ:
3042 Oxf. mss. “and no more defend their doings.”

let him believe in Christ, and follow Christ. For that which had been desired but now for
persecutors thinking evil things, the same the Lord Himself said to Peter. Now in a certain
place Peter willed to go before the Lord.…A little before, “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona,
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but My Father which is in Heaven:” now in
a moment, “Go back behind Me, Satan.”3047 What is, “Go back behind Me”? Follow Me.
Thou willest to go before Me, thou willest to give Me counsel, it is better that thou follow
My counsel: this is, “go back,” go back behind Me. He is silencing one outstripping, in order
that he may go backward; and He is calling him Satan, because he willeth to go before the
Lord. A little before, “blessed;” now, “Satan.” Whence a little before, “blessed”? Because, “to
thee,” He saith, “flesh and blood hath not revealed it, but My Father which is in Heaven.”
Whence now, “Satan”? Because “thou savourest not,” He saith, “the things which are of
God, but the things which are of men.” Let us then that would duly celebrate the nativities
of the Martyrs, long for the imitation of the Martyrs; let us not wish to go before the Martyrs,
and think ourselves to be of better understanding than they, because we shun sufferings in
behalf of righteousness and faith which they shunned not. Therefore be they that think evil
things, and in wantonness feed their hearts, “turned backward and blush.” Let them hear
from the Apostle afterwards saying, “But what fruit had ye some time in those things at
which ye now blush?”
5. What followeth? “Let them be turned away forthwith blushing, that say to me, Well,
well” (ver. 3). Two are the kinds of persecutors, revilers and flatterers. The tongue of the
flatterer doth more persecute than the hand of the slayer: for this also the Scripture hath
called a furnace. Truly when the Scripture was speaking of persecution, it said, “Like gold
in a furnace it hath proved them” (speaking of Martyrs being slain), “and as the holocaust’s
victim it hath received them.”3048 Hear how even the tongue of flatterers is of such sort:
“The proving,” he saith, “of silver and of gold is fire; but a man is proved by the tongue of
men praising him.”3049 That is fire, this also is fire: out of both thou oughtest to go forth
safe. The censurer hath broken thee, thou hast been broken in the furnace like an earthen
vessel. The Word hath moulded thee, and there hath come the trial of tribulation: that which
hath been formed, must needs be seasoned; if it hath been well moulded, there hath come
the fire to strengthen. Whence He said in the Passion, “Dried up like a potsherd hath been
My virtue.” 3050 For Passion and the furnace of tribulation had made Him stronger.…
6. And what cometh to pass when they are all turned back and blush, whether it be they
that seek my soul, or they that think evil things to me, or they that with perverse and feigned

benevolence with tongue would soften the stroke which they inflict, when they shall have
been themselves turned away and confounded; there shall come to pass what? “Let them
exult and be joyous in Thee:” not in me, not in this man or in that man; but in whom they
have been made light that were darkness. “Let them exult and be joyous in Thee, all that
seek Thee” (ver. 4). One thing it is to seek God, another thing to seek man. “Let them be
joyous that seek Thee.” They shall not be joyous then that seek themselves,3051 whom Thou
hast first sought before they sought Thee. Not yet did that sheep seek the Shepherd, it had
strayed from the flock, and He went down to it;3052 He sought it, and carried it back upon
His shoulders. Will He despise thee, O sheep, seeking Him, who hath first sought thee des-
pising Him and not seeking Him? Now then begin thou to seek Him that first hath sought
thee, and hath carried thee back on His shoulders. Do thou that which He speaketh of, “They
that are My sheep hear My voice, and follow Me.”3053 If then thou seekest Him that first
hath sought thee, and hast become a sheep of His, and thou hearest the voice of thy Shepherd,
and followest Him; see what He showeth to thee of Himself, what of His Body, in order that
as to Himself thou mayest not err, as to the Church thou mayest not err, that no one may
say to thee, that is Christ which is not Christ, or that is the Church which is not the Church.
For many men have said that Christ had no flesh, and that Christ hath not risen in His Body:
do not thou follow the voices of them. Hear thou the voice of Himself the Shepherd, that
was clothed with flesh, in order that He might seek lost flesh. He hath risen again, and He
saith, “Handle ye and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me have.”3054 He
showeth Himself to thee, the voice of Him follow thou. He showeth also the Church, that
no one may deceive thee by the name of Church. “It behoved,” He saith, “Christ to suffer,
and to rise again from the dead the third day, and that there should be preached repentance
and remission of sins through all nations, beginning with Jerusalem.”3055 Thou hast the
voice of Thy Shepherd, do not thou follow the voice of strangers:3056 and a thief thou shalt
not fear, if thou shalt have followed the voice of the Shepherd. But how shalt thou follow?
If thou shalt neither have said to any man, as if it were by his own merit, Well, well: nor
shalt have heard the same with joy, so that thy head be not made fat with the oil of a sin-
ner.3057 “Let all them exult and be joyous in Thee, that seek Thee; and let them say”—let
them say what, that exult? “Be the Lord alway magnified!” Let all them say this, that exult

and seek Thee. What? “Be the Lord alway magnified; yea, they that love Thy salvation.” Not
only, “Be the Lord magnified;” but also, “alway.”…A sinner thou art, be He magnified in
order that He may call; thou confessest, be He magnified in order that He may forgive: now
thou livest justly, be He magnified in order that He may direct: thou perseverest even unto
the end, be He magnified in order that He may glorify. “Be the Lord,” then, “alway magnified;
yea, they love His saving health.” For from Him they have salvation, not from themselves.
The saving health of the Lord our God, is the Saviour our Lord Jesus Christ: whosoever
loveth the Saviour, confesseth himself to have been made whole; whosoever confesseth
himself to have been made whole, confesseth himself to have been sick. 3058 Not their own
saving health, as if they could save themselves of themselves: not as it were the saving health
of a man, as though by him they could be saved. “Do not,” he saith, “confide in princes, and
in the sons of men, in whom there is no safety.”3059 Why so? “Of the Lord is safety, and
upon Thy people is Thy blessing.”3060
7. Behold, “Be the Lord magnified:” wilt thou never, wilt thou nowhere? In Him was
something, in me nothing: but if in Him is whatsoever I am, be He, not I. But thou then
what? “But I am needy and poor” (ver. 5). He is rich, He abounding, He needing nothing.
Behold my light, behold whence I am illumined; for I cry, “Thou shalt illumine my candle,
O Lord.”3061 What then of thee? “But I am needy and poor.” I am like an orphan, my soul
is like a widow destitute and desolate: help I seek, alway mine infirmity I confess. There
have been forgiven me my sins, now I have begun to follow the commandments of God:
still, however, I am needy and poor. Why still needy and poor? Because “I see another law
in my members fighting against the law of my mind.”3062 Why needy and poor? Because,
“blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.”3063 Still I hunger, still I thirst:
my fulness hath been put off, not taken away. “O God, aid Thou me.” Most suitably also
Lazarus is said to be interpreted, “one aided:” that needy and poor man, that was transported
into the bosom of Abraham;3064 and beareth the type of the Church, which ought alway to
confess that she hath need of aid. This is true, this is godly. “I have said to the Lord, My God
Thou art.” Why? “For my goods Thou needest not.”3065 He needeth not us, we need Him:
therefore He is truly Lord. For thou art not the very true Lord of thy servant: both are men,

both needing God. But if thou supposest thy servant to need thee, in order that thou mayest
give him bread; thou also needest thy servant, in order that he may aid thy labours. Each
one of you doth need the other. Therefore neither of you is truly lord, and neither of you
truly servant. Hear thou the true Lord, of whom thou art the true servant: “I have said to
the Lord, My God Thou art.” Why art Thou Lord? “Because my goods Thou needest not”?
But what of thee? “But I am needy and poor.” Behold the needy and poor: may God feed,
may God alleviate, may God aid: “O God,” he saith, “aid Thou me.”
8. “My helper and deliverer art Thou; O Lord, delay not.” Thou art the helper and de-
liverer: I need succour, help Thou; entangled I am, deliver Thou. For no one will deliver
from entanglings except Thee. There stand round about us the nooses of divers cares, on
this side and on that we are torn as it were with thorns and brambles, we walk a narrow
way, perchance we have stuck fast in the brambles: let us say to God, “Thou art my deliverer.”
He that showed us the narrow way,3066 hath taught us to follow it.…
9. What is, “delay not”? Because many men say, it is a long time till Christ comes. What
then: because we say, “delay not,” will He come before He hath determined to come? What
meaneth this prayer, “delay not”? May not Thy coming seem to me to be too long delayed.
For to thee it seemeth a long time, to God it seemeth not long, to whom a thousand years
are one day, or the three hours of a watch.3067 But if thou shalt not have had endurance,
late for thee it will be: and when to thee it shall be late, thou wilt be diverted from Him, and
wilt be like unto those that were wearied in the desert, and hastened to ask of God the
pleasant things which He was reserving for them in the Land; and when there were not
given on their journey the pleasant things, whereby perchance they would have been corrup-
ted, they murmured against God, and went back in heart unto Egypt: 3068 to that place
whence in body they had been severed, in heart they went back. Do not thou, then, so, do
not so: fear the word of the Lord, saying, “Remember Lot’s wife.”3069 She too being on the
way, but now delivered from the Sodomites, looked back; in the place where she looked
back, there she remained: she became a statue of salt, in order to season thee. For to thee
she hath been given for an example, in order that thou mayest have sense, mayest not stop
infatuated on the way. Observe her stopping and pass on: observe her looking back, and do
thou be reaching forth unto the things before, as Paul was.3070 What is it, not to look back.
“Of the things behind forgetful,” he saith. Therefore thou followest, being called to the
heavenly reward, whereof hereafter thou wilt glory. For the same Apostle saith, “There re-

Psalm LXX
Psalm LXXI.3072
1. In all the holy Scriptures the grace of God that delivereth us commendeth itself to us,
in order that it may have us commended. This is sung of in this Psalm, whereof we have
undertaken to speak.…This grace the Apostle commendeth: by this he got to have the Jews
for enemies, boasting of the letter of the law and of their own justice. This then commending
in the lesson which hath been read, he saith thus: “For I am the least of the Apostles, that
am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.”3073 “But
therefore mercy,” he saith, “I obtained, because ignorant I did it in unbelief.”3074 Then a
little afterwards, “Faithful the saying is, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I am first.”3075 Were there before him not any sin-
ners? What then, was he the first then? Yea, going before all men not in time, but in evil
disposition. “But therefore,” he saith, “mercy I obtained,” in order that in me Christ Jesus
might show all long-suffering, for the imitation of those that shall believe in Him unto life
eternal: that is, every sinner and unjust man, already despairing of himself, already having
the mind of a gladiator,3076 so as to do whatsoever he willeth, because he must needs be
condemned, may yet observe the Apostle Paul, to whom so great cruelty and so very evil a
disposition was forgiven by God; and by not despairing of himself may he be turned unto
God. This grace God doth commend to us in this Psalm also.…
2. The title then of this Psalm is, as usual, a title intimating on the threshold what is
being done in the house: “To David himself for the sons of Jonadab, and for those that were
first led captive.” Jonadab (he is commended to us in the prophecy of Jeremiah) was a certain
man, who had enjoined his sons not to drink wine, and not to dwell in houses, but in tents.
But the commandment of the father the sons kept and observed, and by this earned a
blessing from the Lord.3077 Now the Lord had not commanded this, but their own father.
But they so received it as though it were a commandment from the Lord their God; for even
though the Lord had not commanded that they should drink no wine and should dwell in
tents; yet the Lord had commanded that sons should obey their father. In this case alone a
son ought not to obey his father, if his father should have commanded anything contrary
to the Lord his God. For indeed the father ought not to be angry, when God is preferred
before him. But when a father doth command that which is not contrary to God; he must

Psalm LXXI
Psalm LXXI
be heard as God is: because to obey one’s father God hath enjoined. God then blessed the
sons of Jonadab because of their obedience, and thrust them in the teeth of His disobedient
people, reproaching them, because while the sons of Jonadab were obedient to their father,
they obeyed not their God. But while Jeremiah was treating of these topics, he had this object
in regard to the people of Israel, that they should prepare themselves to be led for captivity
into Babylon, and should not hope for any other thing, but that they were to be captives.
The title then of this Psalm seemeth from thence to have taken its hue, so that when he had
said, “Of the sons of Jonadab;” he added, “and of them that were first led captive:” not that
the sons of Jonadab were led captive, but because to them that were to be led captive there
were opposed the sons of Jonadab, because they were obedient to their father: in order that
they might understand that they had been made captive, because they were not obedient to
God. It is added also that Jonadab is interpreted, “the Lord’s spontaneous one.” What is
this, the Lord’s spontaneous one? Serving God freely with the will. What is, the Lord’s
spontaneous one? “In me are, O God, Thy vows, which I will render of praise to Thee.” 3078
What is, the Lord’s spontaneous one? “Voluntarily I will sacrifice to Thee.”3079 For if the
Apostolic teaching admonisheth a slave to serve a human master, not as though of necessity,
but of good will, and by freely serving make himself in heart free; how much more must
God be served with whole and full and free will, who seeth thy very will?…The first man
made us captive, the second man hath delivered us from captivity. “For as in Adam all die,
so also in Christ all shall be made alive.” But in Adam they die through the flesh’s nativity,
in Christ they are delivered through the heart’s faith. It was not in thy power not to be born
of Adam: it is in thy power to believe in Christ. Howsoever much then thou shalt have willed
to belong to the first man, unto captivity thou wilt belong. And what is, shalt have willed to
belong? or what is, shalt belong? Already thou belongest: cry out, “Who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?”3080 Let us hear then this man crying out this.
3. “O God, in Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting”
(ver. 1). Already I have been confounded, but not for everlasting. For how is he not confoun-
ded, to whom is said, “What fruit had ye in these things wherein ye now blush?”3081 What
then shall be done, that we may not be confounded for everlasting? “Draw near unto Him,
and be ye enlightened, and your faces shall not blush.”3082 Confounded ye are in Adam,
withdraw from Adam, draw near unto Christ, and then ye shall not be confounded. “In

Psalm LXXI
Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting.” If in myself I am
now3083 confounded, in Thee I shall not be confounded for everlasting.
4. “In Thine own righteousness deliver me, and save me” (ver. 2). Not in mine own, but
in Thine own: for if in mine own, I shall be one of those whereof he saith, “Being ignorant
of God’s righteousness, and their own righteousness willing to establish, to the righteousness
of God they were not made subject.”3084 Therefore, “in Thine own righteousness,” not in
mine. For mine is what? Iniquity hath gone before. And when I shall be righteous, Thine
own righteousness it will be: for by righteousness given to me by Thee I shall be righteous;
and it shall be so mine, as that it be Thine, that is, given to me by Thee. For I believe on Him
that justifieth an ungodly man, so that my faith is counted for righteousness.3085 Even so
then the righteousness shall be mine, not however as though mine own, not as though by
mine own self given to myself: as they thought who through the letter made their boast, and
rejected grace.…It is a small thing then that thou acknowledge the good thing which is in
thee to be from God, unless also on that account thou exalt not thyself above him that hath
not yet, who perchance when he shall have received, will outstrip thee. For when Saul was
a stoner of Stephen,3086 how many were the Christians of whom he was persecutor! Never-
theless, when he was converted, all that had gone before he surpassed. Therefore say thou
to God that which thou hearest in the Psalm, “In Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be
confounded for everlasting: in Thine own righteousness,” not in mine, “deliver me, and
save me.” “Incline unto me Thine ear.” This also is a confession of humility. He that saith,
“Incline unto me,” is confessing that he is lying like a sick man laid at the feet of the Physician
standing. Lastly, observe that it is a sick man that is speaking: “Incline unto me Thine ear,
and save me.”
5. “Be Thou unto me for a protecting God” (ver. 3). Let not the darts of the enemy reach
unto me: for I am not able to protect myself. And a small thing is “protecting:” he hath added,
“and for a walled place, that Thou mayest save me.” “For a walled place” be Thou to me, be
Thou my walled place.…Behold, God Himself hath become the place of thy fleeing unto,
who at first was the fearful object of thy fleeing from. “For a walled place,” he saith, be Thou
to me, “that Thou mayest save me.” I shall not be safe except in Thee: except Thou shalt
have been my rest, my sickness shall not be able to be made whole. Lift me from the earth;
upon Thee I will lie, in order that I may rise unto a walled place. What can be better walled?
When unto that place thou shalt have fled for refuge, tell me what adversaries thou wilt
dread? Who will lie in wait, and come at thee? A certain man is said from the summit of a

Psalm LXXI
mountain to have cried out, when an Emperor was passing by, “I speak not3087 of thee:” the
other is said to have looked back and to have said, “Nor I of thee.” He had despised an Em-
peror with glittering arms, with mighty army. From whence? From a strong place. If he was
secure on a high spot of earth, how secure art thou on Him by whom heaven and earth were
made? I, if for myself I shall have chosen another place, shall not be able to be safe. Choose
thou indeed, O man, if thou shalt have found one, a place better walled. There is not then
a place whither to flee from Him, except we flee to Him. If thou wilt escape Him angry, flee
to Him appeased. “For my firmament and my refuge Thou art.” “My firmament” is what?
Through Thee I am firm, and by Thee I am firm. “For my firmament and my refuge Thou
art:” in order that I may be made firm by Thee, in whatever respects I shall have been made
infirm in myself, I will flee for refuge unto Thee. For firm the grace of Christ maketh thee,
and immovable against all temptations of the enemy. But there is there too human frailness,
there is there still the first captivity, there is there too the law in the members fighting against
the law of the mind, and willing to lead captive in the law of sin:3088 still the body which is
corrupt presseth down the soul.3089 Howsoever firm thou be by the grace of God, so long
as thou still bearest an earthly vessel, wherein the treasure of God is, something must be
dreaded even from that same vessel of clay.3090 Therefore “my firmament Thou art,” in order
that I may be firm in this world against all temptations. But if many they are, and they trouble
me: “my refuge Thou art.” For I will confess mine infirmity, to the end that I may be timid
like a “hare,” because I am full of thorns like a “hedgehog.” And as in another Psalm is said,
“The rock is a refuge for the hedgehogs and the hares:”3091 but the Rock was Christ.3092
6. “O God, deliver me from the hand of the sinner” (ver. 4). Generally, sinners, among
whom is toiling he that is now to be delivered from captivity: he that now crieth, “Unhappy
man I, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus
Christ our Lord.”3093 Within is a foe, that law in the members; there are without also enemies:
unto what cryest thou? Unto Him, to whom hath been cried, “From my secret sins cleanse
me, O Lord, and from strange sins spare Thy servant.”3094…But these sinners are of two
kinds: there are some that have received Law, there are others that have not received: all the
heathen have not received Law, all Jews and Christians have received Law. Therefore the
3087 Or, “I care not.”

general term is sinner; either a transgressor of the Law, if he hath received Law; or only
unjust without Law, if he hath not received the Law. Of both kinds speaketh the Apostle,
and saith, “They that without Law have sinned, without Law shall perish, and they that in
the Law have sinned, by the Law shall be judged.”3095 But thou that amid both kinds dost
groan, say to God that which thou hearest in the Psalm, “My God, deliver me from the hand
of the sinner.” Of what sinner? “From the hand of him that transgresseth the Law, and of
the unjust man.” He that transgresseth the Law is indeed also unjust; for not unjust he is
not, that transgresseth the Law: but every one that transgresseth the Law is unjust, not every
unjust man doth transgress the Law. For, “Where there is not a Law,” saith the Apostle,
“neither is there transgression.”3096 They then that have not received Law, may be called
unjust, transgressors they cannot be called. Both are judged after their deservings. But I that
from captivity will to be delivered through Thy grace, cry to Thee, “Deliver me from the
hand of the sinner.” What is, from the hand of him? From the power of him, that while he
is raging, he lead me not unto consenting with him; that while he lieth in wait, he persuade
not to iniquity. “From the hand of the sinner and of the unjust man.”…
7. Lastly, there followeth the reason why I say this: “for Thou art my patience” (ver. 5).
Now if He is patience rightly, He is that also which followeth, “O Lord, my hope from my
youth.” My patience, because my hope: or rather my hope, because my patience. “Tribula-
tion,” saith the Apostle, “worketh patience, patience probation, but probation hope, but
hope confoundeth not.” 3097 With reason in Thee I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be con-
founded for everlasting. “O Lord, my hope from my youth.” From thy youth is God thy
hope? Is He not also from thy boyhood, and from thine infancy? Certainly, saith he. For see
what followeth, that thou mayest not think that I have said this, “my hope from my youth,”
as if God noways profited mine infancy or my boyhood; hear what followeth: “In Thee I
have been strengthened from the womb.” Hear yet: “From the belly of my mother Thou art
my Protector” (ver. 6). Why then, “from my youth,” except it was the period from which I
began to hope in Thee? For before in Thee I was not hoping, though Thou wast my Protector,
that didst lead me safe unto the time, when I learned to hope in Thee. But from my youth
I began in Thee to hope, from the time when Thou didst arm me against the Devil, so that
in the girding of Thy host being armed with Thy faith, love, hope, and the rest of Thy gifts,
I waged conflict against Thine invisible enemies, and heard from the Apostle, “There is not
for us a wrestling against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and powers,” etc.3098

Psalm LXXI
There a young man it is that doth fight against these things: but though he be a young man,
he falleth, unless He be the hope of Him to whom he crieth, “O Lord, my hope from my
youth.” “In Thee is my singing alway.” Is it only from the time when I began to hope in Thee
until now? Nay, but “alway.” What is, “alway”? Not only in the time of faith, but also in the
time of sight. For now, “So long as we are in the body we are absent from the Lord: for by
faith we walk, not by sight:”3099 there will be a time when we shall see that which being not
seen we believe: but when that hath been seen which we believe, we shall rejoice: but when
that hath been seen which they believed not, ungodly men shall be confounded. Then will
come the substance whereof there is now the hope. But, “Hope which is seen is not hope.
But if that which we see not we hope for, through patience we wait for it.”3100 Now then
thou groanest, now unto a place of refuge thou runnest, in order that thou mayest be saved;
now being in infirmity thou entreatest the Physician: what, when thou shalt have received
perfect soundness also, what when thou shall have been made “equal to the Angels of
God,”3101 wilt thou then perchance forget that grace, whereby thou hast been delivered?
Far be it.
8. “As it were a monster I have become unto many” (ver. 7). Here in time of hope, in
time of groaning, in time of humiliation, in time of sorrow, in time of infirmity, in time of
the voice from the fetters—here then what? “As it were a monster I have become unto many.”
Why, “As it were a monster”? Why do they insult me that think me a monster? Because I
believe that which I see not. For they being happy in those things which they see, exult in
drink, in wantonness, in chamberings, in covetousness, in riches, in robberies, in secular
dignities, in the whitening of a mud wall, in these things they exult: but I walk in a different
way, contemning those things which are present, and fearing even the prosperous things of
the world, and secure in no other thing but the promises of God. And they, “Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die.”3102 What sayest thou? Repeat it: “let us eat,” he saith, “and
drink.” Come now, what hast thou said afterwards? “for to-morrow we die.” Thou hast
terrified, not led me astray. Certainly by the very thing which thou hast said afterwards,
thou hast stricken me with fear to consent with thee. “For to-morrow we die,” thou hast
said: and there hath preceded, “Let us eat and drink.” For when thou hadst said, “Let us eat
and drink;” thou didst add, “for to-morrow we die.” Hear the other side from me, “Yea let
us fast and pray, ‘for to-morrow we die.’” I keeping this way, strait and narrow, “as it were
a monster have become unto many: but Thou art a strong helper.” Be Thou with me, O
Lord Jesus, to say to me, faint not in the narrow way, I first have gone along it, I am the way

itself,3103 I lead, in Myself I lead, unto Myself I lead home. Therefore though “a monster I
have become unto many;” nevertheless I will not fear, for “Thou art a strong Helper.”
9. “Let my mouth be fulfilled with praise, that with hymn I may tell of Thy glory, all the
day long Thy magnificence” (ver. 8). What is “all the day long”? Without intermission. In
prosperity, because Thou dost comfort: in adversity, because Thou dost correct: before I
was in being, because Thou didst make; when I was in being, because Thou didst give health:
when I had sinned, because Thou didst forgive; when I was converted, because Thou didst
help; when I had persevered, because Thou didst crown.
10. My hope from my youth, “cast me not away in time of old age” (ver. 9). What is this
time of old age? “When my strength shall fail, forsake Thou not me.” Here God maketh this
answer to thee, yea indeed let thy strength fail, in order that in thee mine may abide: in order
that thou mayest say with the Apostle, “When I am made weak, then I am mighty.”3104 Fear
not, that thou be cast away in that weakness, in that old age. But why? Was not thy Lord
made weak on the Cross? Did not most mighty men and fat bulls before Him, as though a
man of no strength, made captive and oppressed, shake the head and say, “If Son of God
He is, let Him come down from the Cross”?3105 Has he deserted because He was made weak,
who preferred not to come down from the Cross, lest He should seem not to have displayed
power, but to have yielded to them reviling? What did He hanging teach thee, that would
not come down, but patience amid men reviling, but that thou shouldest be strong in thy
God? Perchance too in His person was said, “As it were a monster I have become unto many,
and Thou art a strong Helper.”3106 In His person according to His weakness, not according
to His power; according to that whereby He had transformed us into Himself, not according
to that wherein He had Himself come down. For He became a monster unto many. And
perchance the same was the old age of Him; because on account of its oldness it is not im-
properly called old age, and the Apostle saith, “Our old man hath been crucified together
with Him.”3107 If there was there our old man, old age was there; because old, old age.3108
Nevertheless, because a true saying is, “Renewed as an eagle’s shall be Thy youth;”3109 He
rose Himself the third day, promised a resurrection at the end of the world. Already there
hath gone before the Head, the members are to follow. Why dost thou fear lest He should
forsake thee, lest He cast thee away for the time of old age, when thy strength shall have

failed? Yea at that time in thee will be the strength of Him, when thy strength shall have
failed.
11. Why do I say this? “For mine enemies have spoken against me, and they that were
keeping watch for My soul, have taken counsel together (ver. 10): saying, God hath forsaken
Him, persecute Him, and seize Him, for there is no one to deliver Him” (ver. 11). This hath
been said concerning Christ. For He that with the great power of Divinity, wherein He is
equal to the Father, had raised to life dead persons, on a sudden in the hands of enemies
became weak, and as if having no power, was seized. When would He have been seized, except
they had first said in their heart, “God hath forsaken Him?” Whence there was that voice
on the Cross, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” 3110 So then did God forsake
Christ, though “God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself,”3111 though Christ
was also God, out of the Jews indeed according to the flesh, “Who is over all things, God
blessed for ever,”3112—did God forsake Him? Far be it. But in our old man our voice it was,
because our old man was crucified together with Him:3113 and of that same our old man
He had taken a Body, because Mary was of Adam. Therefore the very thing which they
thought, from the Cross He said, “Why hast Thou forsaken Me?”3114 Why do these men
think Me left alone to their evil? What is, think Me forsaken in their evil? “For if they had
known, the Lord of glory they had never crucified.3115 Persecute and seize Him.” More fa-
miliarly however, brethren, let us take this of the members of Christ, and acknowledge our
own voice in these words: because even He used such words in our person, not in His own
power and majesty; but in that which He became for our sakes, not according to that which
He was, who hath made us.
12. “O Lord, my God, be not far from me” (ver. 12). So it is, and the Lord is not far off
at all. For, “The Lord is nigh unto them that have bruised the heart.”3116 “My God, unto
my help look Thou.” “Be they confounded and fail that engage3117 my soul” (ver. 13). What
hath he desired? “Be they confounded and fail.” Why hath he desired it? “That engage my
soul”? What is, “That engage my soul”? Engaging as it were unto some quarrel. For they are
said to be engaged that are challenged to quarrel. If then so it is, let us beware of men that
engage our soul. What is, “That engage our soul”? First provoking us to withstand God, in

order that in our evil things God may displease us. For when art thou right, so that to thee
the God of Israel may be good, good to men right in heart?3118 When art thou right? Wilt
thou hear? When in that good which thou doest, God is pleasing to thee; but in that evil
which thou sufferest, God is not displeasing to thee. See ye what I have said, brethren, and
be ye on your guard against men that engage your souls. For all men that deal with you in
order to make you be wearied in sorrows and tribulations, have this aim, namely, that God
may be displeasing to you in that which ye suffer, and there may go forth from your mouth,
“What is this? For what have I done?” Now then hast thou done nothing of evil, and art
thou just, He unjust? A sinner I am, thou sayest, I confess, just I call not myself. But what,
sinner, hast thou by any means done so much evil as he with whom it is well? As much as
Gaiuseius?3119 I know the evil doings of him, I know the iniquities of him, from which I,
though a sinner, am very far; and yet I see him abounding in all good things, and I am suf-
fering so great evil things. I do not then say, O God, “what have I done” to Thee, because I
have done nothing at all of evil; but because I have not done so much as to deserve to suffer
these things. Again, art thou just, He unjust? Wake up, wretched man, thy soul hath been
engaged! I have not, he saith, called myself just. What then sayest thou? A sinner I am, but
I did not commit so great sins, as to deserve to suffer these things. Thou sayest not then to
God, just I am, and Thou art unjust: but thou sayest, unjust I am, but Thou art more unjust.
Behold thy soul hath been engaged, behold now thy soul wageth war. What? Against whom?
Thy soul, against God; that which hath been made against Him by whom it was made. Even
because thou art in being to cry out against Him, thou art ungrateful. Return, then, to the
confession of thy sickness, and beg the healing hand of the Physician. Think thou not they
are happy who flourish for a time. Thou art being chastised, they are being spared: perchance
for thee chastised and amended an inheritance is being kept in reserve.…Lastly, see what
followeth, “Let them put on confusion and shame, that think evil things to me.” “Confusion
and shame,” confusion because of a bad conscience, shame because of modesty. Let this
befall them, and they will be good.…
13. “But I alway in Thee will hope, and will add to all Thy praise” (ver. 14). What is this?
“I will add to all Thy praise,” ought to move us. More perfect wilt thou make the praise of
God? Is there anything to be superadded? If already that is all praise, wilt thou add anything?
God was praised in all His good deeds, in every creature of His, in the whole establishment
of all things, in the government and regulation of ages, in the order of seasons, in the height
of Heaven, in the fruitfulness of the regions of earth, in the encircling of the sea, in every
excellency of the creature everywhere brought forth, in the sons of men themselves, in the
giving of the Law, in delivering His people from the captivity of the Egyptians, and all the
3118 Ps. lxxiii. 1.

Psalm LXXI
rest of His wonderful works: not yet He had been praised for having raised up flesh unto
life eternal. Be there then this praise added by the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ: in
order that here we may perceive His voice above all past praise: thus it is that we rightly
understand this also.…
14. “My mouth shall tell out Thy righteousness” (ver. 15): not mine. From thence I will
add to all Thy praise: because even that I am righteous, if righteous I am, is Thy righteousness
in me, not mine own: for Thou dost justify the ungodly.3120 “All the day long Thy salvation.”
What is, “Thy salvation”? Let no one assume to himself, that he saveth himself, “Of the Lord
is Salvation.”3121 Not any one by himself saveth himself, “Vain is man’s salvation.”3122 “All
the day long Thy Salvation:” at all times. Something of adversity cometh, preach the Salvation
of the Lord: something of prosperity cometh, preach the Salvation of the Lord. Do not preach
in prosperity, and hold thy peace in adversity: otherwise there will not be that which hath
been said, “all the day long.” For all the day long is day together with its own night. Do we
when we say, for example, thirty days have gone by, mention the nights also; do we not
under the very term days include the nights also? In Genesis what was said? “The evening
was made, and the morning was made, one day.”3123 Therefore a whole day is the day to-
gether with its own night: for the night doth serve the day, not the day the night. Whatever
thou doest in mortal flesh, ought to serve righteousness: whatever thou doest by the com-
mandment of God, be it not done for the sake of the advantage of the flesh, lest day serve
night. Therefore all the day long speak of the praise of God, to wit, in prosperity and in ad-
versity; in prosperity, as though in the day time; in adversity, as though in the night time:
all the day long nevertheless speak of the praise of God, so that thou mayest not have sung
to no purpose, “I will bless God at every time, alway the praise of Him is in my mouth.”3124…
15. Therefore, he saith, “For I have not known tradings.”3125 What are these tradings?
Let traders hear and change their life; and if they have been such, be not such; let them not
know what they have been, let them forget; lastly, let them not approve, not praise; let them
disapprove, condemn, be changed, if trading is a sin. For on this account, O thou trader,
because of a certain eagerness for getting, whenever thou shalt have suffered loss, thou wilt
blaspheme; and there will not be in thee that which hath been spoken of, “all the day long
Thy praise.” But whenever for the price of the goods which thou art selling, thou not only
liest, but even falsely swearest; how in thy mouth all the day long is there the praise of God?

Psalm LXXI
While, if thou art a Christian, even out of thy mouth the name of God is being blasphemed,
so that men say, see what sort of men are Christians! Therefore if this man for this reason
speaketh the praise of God all the day long, because he hath not known tradings; let Chris-
tians amend themselves, let them not trade. But a trader saith to me, behold I bring indeed
from a distant quarter merchandise unto these places, wherein there are not those things
which I have brought, by which means I may gain a living: I ask but as reward for my labour,
that I may sell dearer than I have bought: for whence can I live, when it hath been written,
“the worker is worthy of his reward”?3126 But he is treating of lying, of false swearing. This
is the fault of me, not of trading: for I should not, if I would, be unable to do without this
fault. I then, the merchant, do not shift mine own fault to trading: but if I lie, it is I that lie,
not the trade. For I might say, for so much I bought, but for so much I will sell; if thou
pleasest, buy. For the buyer hearing this truth would not be offended, and not a whit less
all men would resort to me: because they would love truth more than gain. Of this then, he
saith, admonish me, that I lie not, that I forswear not; not to relinquish business whereby I
maintain myself. For to what dost thou put me when thou puttest me away from this? Per-
chance to some craft? I will be a shoemaker, I will make shoes for men. Are not they too liars?
are not they too false-swearers? Do they not, when they have contracted to make shoes for
one man, when they have received money from another man, give up that which they were
making, and undertake to make for another, and deceive him for whom they have promised
to make speedily? Do they not often say, to-day I am about it, to-day I’ll get them done?
Secondly, in the very sewing do they not commit as many frauds? These are their doings
and these are their sayings: but they are themselves evil, not the calling which they profess.
All evil artificers, then, not fearing God, either for gain, or for fear of loss or want, do lie,
do forswear themselves; there is no continual praise of God in them. How then dost thou
withdraw me from trading? Wouldest thou that I be a farmer, and murmur against God
thundering, so that, fearing hail, I consult a wizard, in order to learn what to do to protect
me against the weather; so that I desire famine for the poor, in order that I may be able to
sell what I have kept in store? Unto this dost thou bring me? But good farmers, thou sayest,
do not such things. Nor do good traders do those things. But why, even to have sons is an
evil thing, for when their head is in pain, evil and unbelieving mothers seek for impious
charms and incantations? These are the sins of men, not of things. A trader might thus speak
to me—Look then, O Bishop, how thou understand the tradings which thou hast read in
the Psalm: lest perchance thou understand not, and yet forbid me trading. Admonish me
then how I should live; if well, it shall be well with me: one thing however I know, that if I
shall have been evil, it is not trading that maketh me so, but my iniquity. Whenever truth
is spoken, there is nothing to be said against it.
3126 Luke x. 7.
Psalm LXXI
16. Let us inquire then what he hath called tradings, which indeed he that hath not
known, all the day long doth praise God. Trading3127 even in the Greek language is derived
from action, and in the Latin from want of inaction: but whether it be from action or want
of inaction, let us examine what it is. For they that are active traders, rely as it were upon
their own action, they praise their works, they attain not to the grace of God. Therefore
traders are opposed to that grace which this Psalm doth commend. For it doth commend
that grace, in order that no one may boast of his own works. Because in a certain place is
said, “Physicians shall not raise to life,”3128 ought men to abandon medicine? But what is
this? Under this name are understood proud men, promising salvation to men, whereas “of
the Lord is Salvation.”3129…With reason the Lord drave from the Temple them to whom
He said, “It is written, My House shall be called the House of prayer, but ye have made it a
house of trading;”3130 that is, boasting of your works, seeking no inaction, nor hearing the
Scripture speaking against your unrest and trading, “be ye still, and see that I am the
Lord.”3131…
17. But there is in some copies, “For I have not known literature.” Where some books
have “trading,” there others “literature:” how they may accord is a hard matter to find out;
and yet the discrepancy of interpreters perchance showeth the meaning, introduceth no
error. Let us inquire then how to understand literature also, lest we offend grammarians in
the same way as we did traders a little before: because a grammarian too may live honourably
in his calling, and neither forswear nor lie. Let us examine then the literature which he hath
not known, in whose mouth all the day long is the praise of God. There is a sort of literature
of the Jews: for to them let us refer this; there we shall find what hath been said: just as when
we were inquiring about traders, on the score of actions and works, we found that to be
called detestable trading, which the Apostle hath branded, saying, “For being ignorant of
God’s righteousness, and willing to establish their own, to the righteousness of God they
were not made subject.”3132…Just as then we found out the former charge against traders,
that is men boasting of action, exalting themselves because of business which admitteth no
inaction, unquiet men rather than good workmen; because good workmen are those in
whom God worketh; so also we find a sort of literature among the Jews.…Moses wrote five
books: but in the five porches encircling the pool,3133 sick men were lying, but they could

not be healed. See how the letter remained, convicting the guilty, not saving the unrighteous.
For in those five porches, a figure of the five books, sick men were given over rather than
made whole. What then in that place did make whole a sick man? The moving of the water.
When that pool was moved there went down a sick man, and there was made whole one,
one3134 because of unity: whatsoever other man went down unto that same moving was not
made whole. How then was there commended the unity of the Body crying from the ends
of the earth? Another man was not healed, except again the pool were moved. The moving
of the pool then did signify the perturbation of the people of the Jews when the Lord Jesus
Christ came. For at the coming of an Angel the water in the pool was perceived to be moved.
The water then encircled with five porches was the Jewish nation encircled by the Law. And
in the porches the sick lay, and in the water alone when troubled and moved they were
healed. The Lord came, troubled was the water; He was crucified, may He come down in
order that the sick man may be made whole. What is, may He come down? May He humble
Himself. Therefore whosoever ye be that love the letter without grace, in the porches ye will
remain, sick ye will be, lying ill, not growing well.…For the same figure also it is that Eliseus
at first sent a staff by his servant to raise up the dead child. There had died the son of a
widow his hostess; it was reported to him, to his servant he gave his staff: go thou, he saith,
lay it on the dead child. Did the prophet not know what he was doing? The servant went
before, he laid the staff upon the dead, the dead arose not. “For if there had been given a
law which could have made alive, surely out of the law there had been righteousness.” 3135
The law sent by the servant made not alive: and yet he sent his staff by the servant, who
himself afterwards followed, and made alive.3136 For when that infant arose not, Eliseus
came himself, now bearing the type of the Lord, who had sent before his servant with the
staff, as though with the Law: he came to the child that was lying dead, he laid his limbs
upon it. The one was an infant, the other a grown man: he contracted and shortened in a
manner the size of his full growth, in order that he might fit the dead child. The dead then
arose, when he being alive adapted himself to the dead: and the Master did that which the
staff did not; and grace did that which the letter did not. They then that have remained in
the staff, glory in the letter; and therefore are not made alive. But I will to glory concerning
Thy grace.…In that same grace I glorying “literature have not known:” that is, men on the
letter relying, and from grace recoiling, with whole heart I have rejected.
18. With reason there followeth, “I will enter into the power of the Lord:” not mine own,
but the Lord’s. For they gloried in their own power of the letter, therefore grace joined to
the letter they knew not.…But because “the letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh alive:”3137

Psalm LXXI
“I have not known literature, and I will enter into the power of the Lord.” Therefore this
verse following doth strengthen and perfect the sense, so as to fix it in the hearts of men,
and not suffer any other interpretation to steal in from any quarter. “O Lord, I will be
mindful of Thy righteousness alone” (ver. 16). Ah! “alone.” Why hath he added “alone,” I
ask you? It would suffice to say, “I will be mindful of Thy righteousness.” “alone,” he saith,
entirely: there of mine own I think not. “For what hast thou which thou hast not received?
But if also thou hast received, why dost thou glory as if thou hast not received.”3138 Thy
righteousness alone doth deliver me, what is mine own alone is nought but sins. May I not
glory then of my own strength, may I not remain in the letter; may I reject “literature,” that
is, men glorying of the letter, and on their own strength perversely, like men frantic, relying:
may I reject such men, may I enter into the power of the Lord, so that when I am weak, then
I may be mighty; in order that Thou in me mayest be mighty, for, “I will be mindful of Thy
righteousness alone.”
19. “O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth” (ver. 17). What hast thou taught me?
That of Thy righteousness alone I ought to be mindful. For reviewing my past life, I see what
was owing to me, and what I have received instead of that which was owing to me. There
was owing punishment, there hath been paid grace: there was owing hell, there hath been
given life eternal. “O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth.” From the very beginning
of my faith, wherewith Thou hast renewed me, Thou didst teach me that nothing had pre-
ceded in me, whence I might say that there was owing to me what Thou hast given. For who
is turned to God save from iniquity? Who is redeemed save from captivity? But who can
say that unjust was his captivity, when he forsook his Captain and fell off to the deserter?
God is for our Captain,3139 the devil a deserter: the Captain gave a commandment, the
deserter suggested guile:3140 where were thine ears between precept and deceit? was the
devil better than God? Better he that revolted3141 than He that made thee? Thou didst believe
what the devil promised, and didst find what God threatened. Now then out of captivity
being delivered, still however in hope, not yet in substance, walking by faith, not yet by sight,
“O God,” he saith, “Thou hast taught me from my youth.” From the time that I have been
turned to Thee,3142 renewed by Thee who had been made by Thee, re-created who had been
created, re-formed who had been formed: from the time that I have been converted, I have

learned that no merits of mine have preceded, but that Thy grace hath come to me gratis,
in order that I might be mindful of Thy righteousness alone.
20. What next after youth? For, “Thou hast taught me,” he saith, “from my youth:” what
after youth? For in that same first conversion of thine thou didst learn, how before conversion
thou wast not just, but iniquity preceded, in order that iniquity being banished, there might
succeed love: and having been renewed into a new man, only in hope, not yet in substance,
thou didst learn how nothing of thy good had preceded, and by the grace of God thou wast
converted to God: now perchance since the time that thou hast been converted wilt thou
have anything of thine own, and on thy own strength oughtest thou to rely? Just as men are
wont to say, now leave me, it was necessary for thee to show me the way; it is sufficient, I
will walk in the way. And he that hath shown thee the way, “wilt thou not that I conduct
thee to the place?” But thou, if thou art conceited, “let me alone, it is enough, I will walk in
the way.” Thou art left, and through thy weakness again thou wilt lose the way. Good were
it for thee that He should have conducted thee, who first put thee in the way. But unless He
too lead thee, again also thou wilt stray: say to Him then, “Conduct me, O Lord, in Thy way,
and I will walk in Thy truth.”3143 But thy having entered on the way, is youth, the very re-
newal and beginning of the faith. For before thou wast walking through thy own ways a
vagabond; straying through woody places, through rough places, torn in all thy limbs, thou
wast seeking a home, that is, a sort of settlement of thy spirit, where thou mightest say, it is
well; and being in security mightest say it, at rest from every uneasiness, from every trial, in
a word from every captivity; and thou didst not find. What shall I say? Came there to thee
one to show thee the way? There came to thee the Way itself, and thou wast set therein by
no merits of thine preceding, for evidently thou wast straying. What, since the time that
thou hast set foot therein dost thou now direct thyself? Doth He that hath taught thee the
way now leave thee? No, he saith: “Thou hast taught me from my youth; and even until now
I will tell forth Thy wonderful works.” For a wonderful thing is that which still Thou doest;
namely, that Thou dost direct me, who in the way hast put me: and these are Thy wonderful
works. What dost thou think to be the wonderful works of God? What is more wonderful
among God’s wonderful works, than the raising the dead? But am I by any means dead,
thou sayest? Unless dead thou hadst been, there would not have been said to thee, “Rise,
thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall enlighten thee.”3144 Dead are
all unbelievers, all unrighteous men; in body they live, but in heart they are extinct. But he
that raiseth a man dead according to the body, doth bring him back to see this light and to
breathe this air: but he that raiseth is not himself light and air to him; he beginneth to see,
as he saw before. A soul is not so resuscitated. For a soul is resuscitated by God; though even
3143 Ps. lxxxvi. 11.
3144 Eph. v. 14.
Psalm LXXI
a body is resuscitated by God: but God, when He doth resuscitate a body, to the world doth
bring it back: when He doth resuscitate a soul, to Himself He bringeth it back. If the air of
this world be withdrawn, there dieth body: if God be withdrawn, there dieth soul. When
then God doth resuscitate a soul, unless there be with her He that hath resuscitated, she
being resuscitated liveth not. For He doth not resuscitate, and then leave her to live to herself:
in the same manner as Lazarus, when he was resuscitated after being four days dead, was
resuscitated by the Lord’s corporal presence.…The Lord withdrew from that same city or
from that spot, did Lazarus cease to live? Not so is the soul resuscitated: God doth resuscitate
her, she dieth if God shall have withdrawn. For I will speak boldly, brethren, but yet the
truth. Two lives there are, one of the body, another of the soul: as the life of the body is the
soul, so the life of the soul is God: in like manner as, if the soul forsake, the body dieth: so
the soul dieth, if God forsake. This then is His grace, namely, that He resuscitate and be
with us. Because then He doth resuscitate us from our past death, and doth renew in a
manner our life, we say to Him, “O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth.” But because
He doth not withdraw from those whom He resuscitateth, lest when He shall have withdrawn
from them they die, we say to Him, “and even until now I will tell forth Thy wonderful
works:” because while Thou art with me I live, and of my soul Thou art the life, which will
die if she be left to herself. Therefore while my life is present, that is, my God, “even until
now,” what next?
21. “And even unto oldness3145 and old age”3146 (ver. 18). These are two terms for old
age, and are distinguished by the Greeks. For the gravity succeeding youth hath another
name among the Greeks, and after that same gravity the last age coming on hath another
name; for πρεσβύτης signifieth grave, and γ™ρων old. But because in the Latin language the
distinction of these two terms holdeth not, both words implying old age are inserted, oldness
and old age: but ye know them to be two ages. “Thou hast taught me Thy grace from my
youth; and even until now;” after my youth, “I will tell forth Thy wonderful works,” because
Thou art with me in order that I may not die, who hast come in order that I may rise: “and
even unto oldness and old age,” that is, even unto my last breath, unless with me Thou shalt
have been, there will not be any merit of mine; may Thy grace alway remain with me. Even
one man would say this, thou, he, I; but because this voice is that of a certain great Man,
that is, of the Unity itself, for it is the voice of the Church; let us investigate the youth of the
Church. When Christ came, He was crucified, dead, rose again, called the Gentiles, they

Psalm LXXI
began to be converted, became Martyrs strong in Christ, there was shed faithful blood, there
arose a harvest for the Church: this is Her youth. But seasons advancing let the Church
confess, let Her say, “Even until now I will tell forth Thy wonderful works.” Not only in
youth, when Paul, when Peter, when the first Apostles told: even in advancing age I myself,
that is, Thy Unity, Thy members, Thy Body, “will tell forth Thy marvellous works.” What
then? “And even unto oldness and old age,” I will tell forth Thy wonderful works: even until
the end of the world here shall be the Church. For if She were not to be here even unto the
end of the world; to whom did the Lord say, “Behold, I am with you always, even unto the
consummation of the world”? Why was it necessary that these things should be spoken in
the Scriptures? Because there were to be enemies of the Christian Faith who would say, “for
a short time are the Christians, hereafter they shall perish, and there shall come back idols,
there shall come back that which was before. How long shall be the Christians?”3147 “Even
unto oldness and old age:” that is, even unto the end of the world. When thou, miserable
unbeliever, dost expect Christians to pass away, thou art passing away thyself without
Christians: and Christians even unto the end of the world shall endure; and as for thee with
thine unbelief when thou shalt have ended thy short life, with what face wilt thou come
forth to the Judge, whom while thou wast living thou didst blaspheme? Therefore “from my
youth, and even until now, and even unto oldness and old age, O Lord, forsake not me.” It
will not be, as mine enemies say, even for a time. “Forsake not me, until I tell forth Thine
arm to every generation that is yet to come.” And the Arm of the Lord hath been revealed
to whom?3148 The Arm of the Lord is Christ. Do not Thou then forsake me: let not them
rejoice that say, “only for a set time the Christians are.” May there be persons to tell forth
Thine arm. To whom? “To every generation that is yet to come.” If then it be to every gen-
eration that is yet to come, it will be even unto the end of the world: for when the world is
ended, no longer any generation will come on.
22. “Thy power and Thy righteousness” (ver. 19). That is, that I may tell forth to every
generation that is yet to come, Thine arm. And what hath Thine arm effected? This then let
me tell forth, that same grace to every generation succeeding: let me say to every man that
is to be born, nothing thou art by thyself, on God call thou, thine own are sins, merits are
God’s:3149 punishment to thee is owing, and when reward shall have come, His own gifts
He will crown, not thy merits. Let me say to every generation that is to come, out of captivity
thou hast come, unto Adam thou didst belong. Let me say this to every generation that is
to come, that there is no strength of mine, no righteousness of mine; but “Thy strength and
Thy righteousness, O God, even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.”

Psalm LXXI
“Thy power and Thy righteousness,” as far as what? even unto flesh and blood? Nay, “even
unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.” For the high places are the
heavens, in the high places are the Angels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers: to
Thee they owe it that they are; to Thee they owe it that they live, to Thee they owe it that
righteously they live, to Thee they owe it that blessedly they live. “Thy power and Thy
righteousness,” as far as what? “Even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast
made.” Think not that man alone belongeth to the grace of God. What was Angel before he
was made? What is Angel, if He forsake him who hath created? Therefore “Thy power and
Thy justice even unto the most high mighty works which Thou hast made.”
23. And man exalteth himself: and in order that he may belong to the first captivity, he
heareth the serpent suggesting, “Taste, and ye shall be as Gods.”3150 Men as Gods? “O God,
who is like unto Thee?” Not any in the pit, not in Hell, not in earth, not in Heaven, for all
things Thou hast made. Why doth the work strive with the Maker? “O God, who is like
unto Thee?” But as for me, saith miserable Adam, and Adam is3151 every man, while I per-
versely will to be like unto Thee, behold what I have become, so that from captivity to Thee
I cry out: I with whom it was well under a good king, have been made captive under my se-
ducer; and cry out to Thee, because I have fallen from Thee. And whence have I fallen from
Thee? While I perversely seek to be like unto Thee.…
24. Ill straying, ill presuming, doomed to die by withdrawing from the path3152 of
righteousness: behold he breaketh the commandment, he hath shaken off from his neck the
yoke of discipline, uplifted with high spirit he hath broken in sunder the reins of guidance:
where is he now? Truly captive he crieth, “O Lord, who is like unto Thee?” I perversely
willed to be like unto Thee, and I have been made like unto a beast! Under Thy dominion,
under Thy commandment, I was indeed like: “But a man in honour set hath not perceived,
he hath been compared to beasts without sense, and hath been made like unto them.”3153
Now out of the likeness of beasts cry though late and say, “O God, who is like unto Thee?”
25. “How great troubles hast Thou shown to me, many and evil!” (ver. 20). Deservedly,
proud servant. For thou hast willed perversely to be like thy God, who hadst been made
after the image of thy Lord.3154 Wouldest thou have it to be well with thee, when withdrawing
from that good? Truly God saith to thee, if thou withdrawest from Me, and it is well with
thee, I am not thy good. Again, if He is good, and in the highest degree good, and of Himself
to Himself good, and by no foreign good thing good, and is Himself our chief good; by

withdrawing from Him, what wilt thou be but evil? Also if He is Himself our blessedness,
what will there be to one withdrawing from Him, except misery? Return thou then after
misery, and say, “O Lord, who is like unto Thee? How great troubles hast Thou shown to
me, many and evil!”
26. But this was discipline; admonition, not desertion. Lastly, giving thanks, he saith
what? “And being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the
earth again Thou hast brought me back.” But when before? What is this “again”? Thou hast
fallen from a high place, O man, disobedient slave, O thou proud against thy Lord, thou
hast fallen. There hast come to pass in thee, “every one that exalteth himself shall be
humbled:” may there come to pass in thee, “every one that humbleth himself shall be exal-
ted.”3155 Return thou from the deep. I return, he saith, I return, I acknowledge; “O God,
who is like unto Thee? How great troubles hast Thou shown to me, many and evil! and being
turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again Thou
hast brought me back.” “We perceive,” I hear. Thou hast brought us back from the bottomless
places of the earth, hast brought us back from the depth and drowning of sin. But why
“again”? When had it already been done? Let us go on, if perchance the latter parts of the
Psalm itself do not explain to us the thing which here we do not yet perceive, namely, why
he hath said “again.” Therefore let us hear: “How great troubles Thou hast shown to me,
many and evil! And being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places
of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” What then? “Thou hast multiplied Thy
righteousness, and being turned Thou hast comforted me, and from the bottomless places
of the earth again Thou hast brought me back” (ver. 21). Behold a second “again”! If we labour
to unravel this “again” when written once, who will be able to unravel it when doubled?
Now “again” itself is a redoubling, and once more there is written “again.” May He be with
us from whom is grace, may there be with us the arm also which we are telling forth to every
generation that is to come: may He be with us Himself, and as with the key of His Cross
open to us the mystery that is locked up. For it was not to no purpose that when He was
crucified the veil of the temple was rent in the midst, but to show that through His Passion
the secret things of all mysteries were opened.3156 May He then Himself be with men passing
over unto Him, be the veil taken away:3157 may our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ tell us
why such a voice of the Prophet hath been sent before, “Thou hast shown to me troubles
many and evil: and being turned Thou hast made me alive, and from the bottomless places
of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.” Behold this is the first “again” which hath
been written. Let us see what this is, and we shall see why there is a second “again.”

Psalm LXXI
27. …Therein Christ died, wherein thou art to die: and therein Christ rose again, wherein
thou art to rise again. By His example He taught thee what thou shouldest not fear, for what
thou shouldest hope. Thou didst fear death, He died: thou didst despair of rising again, He
rose again. But thou sayest to me, He rose again, do I by any means rise again? But He rose
again in that which for thee He received of thee. Therefore thy nature in Him hath preceded
thee; and that which was taken of thee, hath gone up before thee: therein therefore thou also
hast ascended. Therefore He ascended first, and we in Him: because that flesh is of the human
race.…Behold one “again.” Hear of its being fulfilled from the Apostle: “If then ye have risen
with Christ, the things which are above seek ye, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of
God; the things which are above mind ye, not the things which are upon the earth.” 3158 He
then hath gone before: already we also have risen again, but still in hope. Hear the Apostle
Paul saying this same thing: “Even we ourselves groan in ourselves, looking for the adoption,
the redemption of our body.” What is it then that Christ hath granted to thee? Hear that
which followeth: “For by hope we are saved: but hope which is seen is not hope. For that
which a man seeth, why doth he hope for? But if that which we see not we hope for, through
patience we wait for it.” We have been brought back therefore again from the bottomless
places in hope. Why again? Because already Christ had gone before. But because we shall
rise again in substance, for now in hope we are living, now after faith we are walking; we
have been brought back from the bottomless places of the earth, by believing in Him who
before us hath risen again from the bottomless place of the earth.…Thou hast heard one
“again,” thou hast heard the other: “again;” one “again” because of Christ going before; and
the other, yet however in hope, and a thing which remaineth to be in substance. “Thou hast
multiplied Thy righteousness,”3159 already in me believing, already in those that first have
risen again in hope.…“Thou hast multiplied Thy righteousness, and being turned Thou
hast comforted me:” and because of the body to rise again at the end, even from the bottom-
less places of the earth again Thou hast brought me back.
28. “For I will confess to Thee in the vessels of a Psalm Thy truth” (ver. 22). The vessels
of a Psalm are a Psaltery. But what is a Psaltery? An instrument of wood and strings.3160
What doth it signify? There is some difference between it and a harp:…there seemeth to be
signified by the Psaltery the Spirit, by the harp the flesh. And because he had spoken of two
bringings back of ours from the bottomless places of the earth, one after the Spirit in hope,
the other after the body in substance; hear thou of these two: “For I will confess to Thee in
the vessels of a Psalm Thy truth.” This after the Spirit: concerning the body what? “I will
psalm to Thee on a harp, Holy One of Israel.”

Psalm LXXI
29. Again hear this because of that same “again” and “again.” “My lips shall exult when
I shall psalm to Thee” (ver. 23). Because lips are wont to be spoken of both belonging to the
inner and to the outward man, it is uncertain in what sense lips have been used: there fol-
loweth therefore, “And my soul which Thou hast redeemed.” Therefore regarding the inward
lips having been saved in hope, brought back from the bottomless places of the earth in faith
and love, still however waiting for the redemption of our body,3161 we say what? Already
he hath said, “And my soul which Thou hast redeemed.” But lest thou shouldest think the
soul alone redeemed, wherein now thou hast heard one “again,” “but still,” he saith; why
still? “but still my tongue also:” therefore now the tongue of the body: “all day long shall
meditate of Thy righteousness” (ver. 24): that is, in eternity without end. But when shall
this be? Hereafter at the end of the world, at the resurrection of the body and the changing
into the Angelic state. Whence is it proved that this is spoken of the end, “but still my tongue
also all day long shall meditate of Thy righteousness”? “When they shall have been confoun-
ded and shall have blushed, that seek evil things for me.” When shall they be confounded,
when shall they blush, save at the end of the world? For in two ways they shall be confounded,
either when they shall believe in Christ, or when Christ shall have come. For so long as the
Church is here, so long as grain groaneth amid chaff, so long as wheat groaneth amid
tares,3162 so long as vessels of mercy groan amid vessels of wrath made for dishonour,3163
so long as lily groaneth amid thorns, there will not be wanting enemies to say, “When shall
he die, and his name perish?”3164 “Behold there shall come the time when Christians shall
be ended and shall be no more: as they began at a set time, so even unto a particular time
they shall be.” But while they are saying these things and without end3165 are dying, and
while the Church is continuing preaching the Arm of the Lord3166 to every generation that
is to come; there shall come Himself also at last in His glory,3167 there shall rise again all
the dead, each with his cause: there shall be severed good men to the right hand, but evil
men to the left, and they shall be confounded that did insult, they shall blush that did mock:
and so my tongue after resurrection shall meditate of Thy righteousness, all day long of Thy
praise, “when they shall have been confounded and shall have blushed, that seek evil things
for me.”

Psalm LXXI
Psalm LXXII.3168
1. “For Salomon” indeed this Psalm’s title is fore-noted: but things are spoken of therein
which could not apply to that Salomon king of Israel after the flesh, according to those things
which holy Scripture speaketh concerning him: but they can most pertinently apply to the
Lord Christ. Whence it is perceived, that the very word Salomon is used in a figurative sense,
so that in him Christ is to be taken. For Salomon is interpreted peace-maker: and on this
account such a word to Him most truly and excellently doth apply, through Whom, the
Mediator, having received remission of sins, we that were enemies are reconciled to God.
For “when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.”3169
The Same is Himself that Peace-maker.…Since then we have found out the true Salomon,
that is, the true Peace-maker: next let us observe what the Psalm doth teach concerning
Him.
2. “O God, Thy judgment to the King give Thou, and Thy justice to the King’s Son”
(ver. 1). The Lord Himself in the Gospel saith, “The Father judgeth not any one, but all
judgment He hath given to the Son:”3170 this is then, “O God, Thy judgment to the King
give Thou.” He that is King is also the Son of the King: because God the Father also is cer-
tainly King. Thus it hath been written, that the King made a marriage for His Son.3171 But
after the manner of Scripture the same thing is repeated. For that which he hath said in,
“Thy judgment;” the same he hath otherwise expressed in, “Thy justice:” and that which he
hath said in, “the King,” the same he hath otherwise expressed in, “to the King’s Son.”…But
these repetitions do much commend the divine sayings, whether the same words, or
whether in other words the same sense be repeated: and they are mostly found in the Psalms,
and in the kind of discourse whereby the mind’s affection is to be awakened.
3. Next there followeth, “To judge Thy people in justice, and Thy poor in judgment”
(ver. 2). For what purpose the royal Father gave to the royal Son His judgment and His
justice is sufficiently shown when he saith, “To judge Thy people in justice;” that is, for the
purpose of judging Thy people. Such an idiom is found in Salomon: “The Proverbs of Sa-
lomon, son of David, to know wisdom and discipline:” 3172 that is, the Proverbs of Salomon,
for the purpose of knowing wisdom and discipline. So, “Thy judgment give Thou, to judge
Thy people:” that is, “Thy judgment” give Thou for the purpose of judging Thy people. But
that which he saith before in, “Thy people,” the same he saith afterwards in, “Thy poor:”
and that which he saith before in, “in justice;” the same afterward in, “in judgment:” according

Psalm LXXII
to that manner of repetition. Whereby indeed he showeth, that the people of God ought to
be poor, that is, not proud, but humble. For, “blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of Heaven.”3173 In which poverty even blessed Job was poor even before he had
lost those great earthly riches. Which thing for this reason I thought should be mentioned,
because there are certain persons who are more ready to distribute all their goods to the
poor,3174 than themselves to become the poor of God. For they are puffed up with boasting
wherein they think their living well should be ascribed to themselves, not to the grace of
God: and therefore now they do not even live well, however great the good works which
they seem to do.…
4. But seeing that he hath changed the order of the words (though he had first said, “O
God, Thy judgment to the King give Thou, and Thy justice to the King’s Son,” putting
judgment first, then justice), and hath put justice first, then judgment, saying, “To judge
Thy people in justice, and Thy poor in judgment:” he doth more clearly show that he hath
called judgment justice, proving that there is no difference made by the order in which the
word is placed, because it signifieth the same thing. For it is usual to say “wrong judgment”
of that which is unjust: but justice iniquitous or unjust we are not wont to speak of. For if
wrong and unjust it be; no longer must it be called justice. Again, by putting down judgment
and repeating it under the name of justice, or by putting down justice and repeating it under
the name of judgment, he clearly showeth that he specially nameth that judgment which is
wont to be put instead of justice, that is, that which cannot be understood of giving an evil
judgment. For in the place where He saith, “Judge not according to persons, but right
judgment judge ye;”3175 He showeth that there may be a wrong judgment, when He saith,
“right judgment judge ye:” lastly, the one He doth forbid, the other He doth enjoin. But
when without any addition He speaketh of judgment, He would at once have just judgment
to be understood: as is that which He saith, “Ye forsake the weightier matters of the Law,
mercy and judgment.”3176 That also which Jeremiah saith is, “making his riches not with
judgment.”3177 He saith not, making his riches by wrong or unjust judgment, or not with
judgment right or just, but not with judgment: calling not anything judgment but what is
right and just.
5. “Let the mountains bear peace to the people, and the hills justice” (ver. 3). The
mountains are the greater, the hills the less. These are without doubt those which another
Psalm hath, “little with great.”3178 For those mountains did exult like rams, and those hills

Psalm LXXII
like lambs of the sheep, at the departure of Israel out of Egypt, that is, at the deliverance of
the people of God from this world’s servitude. Those then that are eminent in the Church
for passing sanctity, are the mountains, who are meet to teach other men also,3179 by so
speaking as that they may be faithfully taught, by so living as that they may imitate them to
their profit: but the hills are they that follow the excellence of the former by their own
obedience. Why then “the mountains peace: and the hills justice”?3180 Would there perchance
have been no difference, even if it had been said thus, Let the mountains bear justice to the
people and the hills peace? For to both justice, and to both peace is necessary: and it may
be that under another name justice herself may have been called peace. For this is true peace,
not such as unjust men make among them. Or rather with a distinction not to be overlooked
must that be understood which he saith, “the mountains peace, and the hills justice”? For
men excelling in the Church ought to counsel for peace with watchful care; lest for the sake
of their own distinctions by acting proudly they make schisms and dissever the bond of
union. But let the hills so follow them by imitation and obedience, that they prefer Christ
to them: lest being led astray by the empty authority of evil mountains (for they seem to
excel), they tear themselves away from the Unity of Christ.…
6. Thus also most pertinently may be understood, “let the mountains bear peace to the
people,” namely, that we understand the peace to consist in the reconciliation whereby we
are reconciled to God: for the mountains receive this for His people.…“Let the mountains,
therefore, receive peace for the people, and the hills justice:” so that in this manner, both
being at one, there may come to pass that which hath been written, “justice and peace have
kissed one another.”3181 But that which other copies have, “let the mountains receive peace
for the people, and let the hills:” I think must be understood of all sorts of preaching of
Gospel peace, whether those that go before, or those that follow after. But in these copies
this followeth, “in justice He shall judge the poor of the people.” But those copies are more
approved of which have that which we have expounded above, “let the mountains bear peace
to the people, and the hills justice.” But some have, “to Thy people;” some have not to “Thy,”
but only “to the people.”
7. “He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the sons of the poor” (ver. 4).
The poor and the sons of the poor seem to me to be the very same, as the same city is Sion
and the daughter of Sion. But if it is to be understood with a distinction, the poor we take
to be the mountains, but the sons of the poor the hills: for instance, Prophets and Apostles,
the poor, but the sons of them, that is, those that profit under their authority, the sons of
3179 2 Tim. ii. 2.
3180 [Coleridge has justly remarked on the feebleness of this Latin word justice, as compared with our English
“righteousness.”—C.]
3181 Ps. lxxxv. 10.
Psalm LXXII
the poor. But that which hath been said above, “shall judge;” and afterwards, “shall save;”
is as it were a sort of exposition in what manner He shall judge. For to this end He shall
judge, that He may save, that is, may sever from those that are to be destroyed and con-
demned, those to whom He giveth “salvation ready to be revealed at the” last time.3182 For
by such men to Him is said, “Destroy not with ungodly men my soul:”3183 and, “Judge Thou
me, O God, and sever my cause from the nation unholy.”3184 We must observe also that he
saith not, He shall judge the poor people, but, “the poor of the people.” For above when he
had said, “to judge Thy people in justice and Thy poor in judgment,”3185 the same he called
the people of God as His poor, that is, only the good and those that belong to the right hand
side. But because in this world those for the right and those for the left feed together, who,
like lambs and goats at the last are to be put asunder;3186 the whole, as it is mingled together,
he hath called by the name of the People. And because even here he putteth judgment in a
good sense, that is, for the purpose of saving: therefore he saith, “He shall judge the poor of
the people,” that is, shall sever for salvation those that are poor among the people. “And He
shall humble the false-accuser.” No false-accuser can be more suitably recognised here than
the devil. False accusation is his business. “Doth Job worship God gratis?”3187 But the Lord
Jesus doth humble him, by His grace aiding His own, in order that they may worship God
gratis, that is, may take delight in the Lord.3188 He humbled him also thus; because when
in Him the devil, that is, the prince of this world, had found nothing,3189 he slew Him by
the false accusations of the Jews, whom the false-accuser made use of as his vessels, working
in the sons of unbelief.3190…
8. “And He shall endure to the sun,” or, “shall endure with the sun” (ver. 5). For thus
some of our writers have thought would be more exactly translated that which in the Greek
is συμπαραμενεῖ. But if in Latin it could have been expressed in one word, it must have
been expressed by compermanebit: however, because in Latin the word cannot be expressed,
in order that the sense at least might be translated, it hath been expressed by, “He shall endure
with the sun.” For He shall co-endure to the sun is nothing else but, “He shall endure with
the sun.” But what great matter is it for Him to endure with the sun, through whom all

things were made, and without whom nothing was made,3191 save that this prophecy hath
been sent before for the sake of those who think that the religion of the Christian name up
to a particular time in this world will live, and afterwards will be no more?3192 “He shall
endure” therefore “with the sun,” so long as the sun riseth and setteth, that is, so long as
these times revolve, there shall not be wanting the Church of God, that is, Christ’s body on
earth. But that which he addeth, “and before the moon, generations of generations:” he
might have expressed by, and before the sun, that is, both with the sun and before the sun:
which would have been understood by both with times and before times. That then which
goeth before time is eternal: and that is truly to be held eternal which by no time is changed,
as, “in the beginning was the Word.”3193 But by the moon he hath chosen rather to intimate
the waxings and wanings of things mortal. Lastly, when he had said, “before the moon,”
wishing in a manner to explain for what purpose he inserted the moon, “generations,” he
saith, “of generations.” As though he were saying, before the moon, that is, before the gen-
erations of generations which pass away in the departure and succession of things mortal,
like the lunar wanings and waxings. And thus what is better to be understood by His enduring
before the moon, than that He taketh precedence of all mortal things by immortality? Which
also as followeth may not impertinently be taken, that whereas now, having humbled the
false-accuser, He sitteth at the right hand of the Father, this is to endure with the sun. For
the brightness of the eternal glory is understood to be the Son:3194 as though the Sun were
the Father, and the Brightness of Him His Son. But as these things may be spoken of the
invisible Substance of the Creator, not as of that visible creation wherein are bodies celestial,
of which bright bodies the sun hath the pre-eminence, from which this similitude hath been
drawn: just as they are drawn even from things earthly, to wit, stone, lion, lamb, man having
two sons, and the like: therefore having humbled the false-accuser, He endureth with the
sun: because having vanquished the devil by the Resurrection, He sitteth at the right hand
of the Father,3195 where He dieth no more, and death no longer over Him shall have
dominion.3196 This too is before the moon, as though the First-born from the dead were
going before the Church, which is passing on in the departure and succession of mortals.
These are “the generations of generations.” Or perchance it is because generations are those
whereby we are begotten mortally; but generations of generations those whereby we are
begotten again immortally. And such is the Church which He went before, in order that He

might endure before the moon, being the First-born of the dead. To be sure, that which is
in the Greek γενεας γενεῶν, some have interpreted, not “generations,” but, “of a generation
of generations:” because γενεας is of ambiguous case in Greek, and whether it be the genitive
singular της γενε‚ς, that is, of the generation, or the accusative plural τὰς γενεὰς, that is, the
generations, doth not clearly appear, except that deservedly that sense hath been preferred
wherein, as though explaining what he had called “the moon,” he added in continuation,
“generations of generations.”
9. “And He shall come down like rain into a fleece, and like drops distilling upon the
earth” (ver. 6). He hath called to our minds and admonished us, that what was done by
Gedeon the Judge, in Christ hath its end. For he asked a sign of the Lord, that a fleece laid
on the floor should alone be rained upon, and the floor should be dry; and again, the fleece
alone should be dry, and the floor should be rained upon; and so it came to pass.3197 Which
thing signified, that, being as it were on a floor in the midst of the whole round world, the
dry fleece was the former people Israel. The same Christ therefore Himself came down like
rain upon a fleece, when yet the floor was dry: whence also He said, “I am not sent but to
the sheep which were lost of the house of Israel.”3198 There He chose out a Mother by whom
to receive the form of a servant, wherein He was to appear to men: there the disciples, to
whom He gave this same injunction, saying, “Into the way of the nations go ye not away,
and into the cities of the Samaritans enter ye not: go ye first to the sheep which are lost of
the house of Israel.”3199 When He saith, go ye first to them, He showeth also that hereafter,
when at length the floor was to be rained upon, they would go to other sheep also, which
were not of the old people Israel, concerning whom He saith, “I have other sheep which are
not of this fold, it behoveth Me to bring in them also, that there may be one flock and one
Shepherd.”3200 Hence also the Apostle: “for I say,” he saith, “that Christ was a minister of
the Circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers.”3201 Thus
rain came down upon the fleece, the floor being yet dry. But inasmuch as he continueth,
“but that the nations should glorify God for His mercy:”3202 that when the time came on,
that should be fulfilled which by the Prophet He saith, “a people whom I have not known
hath served Me, in the hearkening of the ear it hath obeyed Me:”3203 we now see, that of
the grace of Christ the nation of the Jews hath remained dry, and the whole round world

through all nations is being rained upon by clouds full of Christian grace. For by another
word he hath indicated the same rain, saying, “drops distilling:” no longer upon the fleece,
but “upon the earth.” For what else is rain but drops distilling? But that the above nation
under the name of a fleece is signified, I think is either because they were to be stripped of
the authority of teaching, just as a sheep is stripped of its skin; or because in a secret place
He was hiding that same rain, which He willed not should be preached to uncircumcision,
that is, be revealed to uncircumcised nations.
10. “There shall arise in His days justice and abundance of peace, until the moon be
taken away” (ver. 7). The expression tollatur some have interpreted by “be taken away,”
but others by “be exalted,” translating one Greek word, which is there used, ‡νταναιρεθῇ,
just as each of them thought good. But they who have said, “be removed,” and they who
have said, “be taken away,” do not so very much differ. For by the expression, “be removed,”
custom doth teach us that there should be rather implied, that a thing is taken away and is
no more, than that it is raised to a higher place: but “be taken away” can be understood in
no other way at all, than that a thing is destroyed: that is, it is no more: but by “be exalted,”
only that it is raised to a higher place. Which indeed when it is put in a bad sense is wont
to signify pride: as is the passage, “In thy wisdom be not exalted.”3204 But in a good sense
it belongeth to a more exceeding honour, as, for instance, when anything is being raised; as
is, “In the nights exalt ye your hands unto holy places, and bless ye the Lord.”3205 Here then
if we have understood the expression, “be removed,” what will be, “until the moon be re-
moved,” but that it be so dealt with that it be no more? For perchance he willed this also to
be perceived, that mortality is to be no longer, “when the last enemy shall be destroyed,
death:”3206 so that abundance of peace may be brought down so far as that nothing may
withstand the felicity of the blessed from the infirmity of mortality: which will come to pass
in that age, of which we have the faithful promise of God through Jesus Christ our Lord,
concerning which it is said, “There shall arise in His days justice and abundance of peace:”
until, death being utterly overcome and destroyed, all mortality be consumed. But if under
the term moon, not the mortality of the flesh through which the Church is now passing,
but the Church Herself in general hath been signified, which is to endure for everlasting,
being delivered from this mortality, thus must be taken the expression, “There shall arise
in His days justice and abundance of peace, until the moon be exalted;” as though it were
said, There shall arise in His days justice, to conquer the contradiction and rebellion of the
flesh, and whereby there may be made a peace so increasing and abundant, until the moon
be exalted, that is, until the Church be lifted up, through the glory of the Resurrection to

reign with Him, who went before Her in this glory, the first-born of the dead, that He might
sit at the right hand of the Father;3207 thus with the sun3208 enduring before the moon, in
the place whereunto hereafter was to be exalted the moon also.
11. “And He shall be Lord from sea even unto sea, and from the river even unto the
ends of the round world” (ver. 8): He to wit concerning whom he had said, “There shall
arise in His days justice and abundance of peace, until the moon be exalted.”3209 If the
Church here is properly signified under the term moon, in continuation he showed how
widely that same Church He was going to spread abroad, when He added, “and He shall be
Lord from sea even unto sea.” For the land is encircled by a great sea which is called the
Ocean: from which there floweth in some small part in the midst of the lands, and maketh
those seas known to us, which are frequented by ships. Again, in “from sea even unto sea”
He hath said, that from any one end of the earth even unto any other end, He would be
Lord, whose name and power in the whole world were to be preached and to prevail exceed-
ingly. To which, that there might not be understood in any other manner, “from sea even
unto sea:” He immediately added, “and from the river even unto the ends of the round
world.” Therefore that which He saith in “even unto the ends of the round world,” the same
He had said before in “from sea even unto sea.” But in that which now He saith, “from the
river,” He hath evidently expressed that He willed Christ to publish at length His power
from that place from whence also He began to choose His disciples, to wit from the river
Jordan, where upon the Lord, on His baptism, when the Holy Ghost descended, there
sounded a voice from Heaven, “This is My beloved Son.”3210 From this place then His
doctrine and the authority of the heavenly ministry setting out, is enlarged even unto the
ends of the round world, when there is preached the Gospel of the kingdom in the whole
world, for a testimony unto all nations: and then shall come the end.3211
12. “In His presence shall fall down the Ethiopians, and His enemies shall lick the earth”
(ver. 9). By the Ethiopians, as by a part the whole, He hath signified all nations, selecting
that nation to mention especially by name, which is at the ends of the earth. By “in His
presence shall fall down” hath been signified, shall adore Him. And because there were to
be schisms in divers quarters of the world, which would be jealous of the Church Catholic
spread abroad in the whole round world, and again those same schisms dividing themselves
into the names of men, and by loving the men under whose authority they had been rent,
opposing themselves to the glory of Christ which is throughout all lands; so when He had

Psalm LXXII
said, “in His presence shall fall down the Ethiopians,” He added, “and His enemies shall lick
the earth:” that is, shall love men, so that they shall be jealous of the glory of Christ, to whom
hath been said, “Be Thou exalted above the Heavens, O God, and above all the earth Thy
glory.”3212 For man earned to hear, “Earth thou art, and unto earth thou shalt go.”3213 By
licking this earth, that is, being delighted with the vainly talking authority of such men, by
loving them, and by counting them for the most pleasing of men, they gainsay the divine
sayings, whereby the Catholic Church hath been foretold, not as to be in any particular
quarter of the world, as certain schisms are, but in the whole universe by bearing fruit and
growing so as to attain even unto the very Ethiopians, to wit, the remotest and foulest of
mankind. 3214
13. 3215“The kings of Tharsis and the isles shall offer gifts, the kings of the Arabians and
of Saba shall lead3216 presents” (ver. 10). This no longer requireth an expounder but a
thinker; yea it doth thrust itself upon the sight not only of rejoicing believers, but also of
groaning unbelievers—except perchance we must inquire why there hath been said, “shall
lead presents.” For there are wont to be led those things which can walk. For could it by any
means have been spoken with reference to the sacrifice of victims? Far be it that such
“righteousness” should arise in His days. But those gifts which have been foretold as to be
led, seem to me to signify men, whom into the fellowship of the Church of Christ the author-
ity of kings doth lead: although even persecuting kings have led gifts, knowing not what
they did, in sacrificing the holy Martyrs. “And there shall adore Him all kings of the earth,
all nations shall serve Him” (ver. 11).
14. But while he is explaining the reasons why so great honour is paid Him by kings,
and He is served of all nations: “because He hath delivered,” he saith, “the needy man from
the mighty, and the poor man, to whom was no helper”(ver. 12). This needy and poor man
is the people of men believing in Him. In this people are also kings adoring Him. For they
do not disdain to be needy and poor, that is, humbly confessing sins, and needing the glory
of God3217 and the grace of God, in order that this King, Son of the King, may deliver them
from the mighty one. For this same mighty one is he who above was called the Slanderer:
whom mighty to subdue men to himself, and to hold them bound in captivity, not his virtue
did make, but men’s sins. The same is himself also called strong; therefore here mighty also.
But He that hath humbled the slanderer and hath entered into the house of the strong man

Psalm LXXII
to bind him and to spoil his vessels,3218 He “hath delivered the needy and the poor man.”
For this neither the virtue of any one could accomplish, nor any just man, nor any Angel.
When then there was no helper, by His coming He saved them Himself.
15. But it might occur to one; if because of sins man was held by the devil, have sins
pleased Christ, who saved the needy man from the mighty? Far be it. But “He it is that shall
spare the helpless and poor man” (ver. 13): that is, shall remit sins to the man, humble and
not trusting in his own merits, or hoping for salvation because of his own virtue, but needing
the grace of his Saviour. But when he hath added, “and the souls of the poor He shall save:”
he hath recommended to our notice both the aids of grace; both that which is for the remis-
sion of sins, when he saith, “He shall spare the poor and needy man;” and that which doth
consist in the imparting of righteousness, when he hath added, “and the souls of the poor
He shall save.” For no one is meet of himself for salvation (which salvation is perfect right-
eousness), unless God’s grace aid: because the fulness of the law is nought but love, which
doth not exist in us of ourselves, but is shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit
which hath been given unto us.3219
16. “From usuries and iniquity He shall redeem the souls of them” (ver. 14). What are
these usuries but sins, which are also called debts?3220 But I think they have been called us-
uries, because more of ill is found in the punishments than hath been committed in the sins.
For, for example’s sake, while a man-slayer killeth only the body of a man, but can no wise
hurt the soul; of himself both soul and body is destroyed in hell. Because of such despisers
of present commandment and deriders of future punishment hath been said, “I coming
would have exacted with usuries,”3221 from these usuries are redeemed the souls of the poor
by that blood which hath been shed for the remission of sins. He shall redeem, I say, from
usuries, by remitting sins which owed larger punishments: but He shall redeem from iniquity,
by helping them by grace even to do righteousness. Therefore the same two things have
been repeated which were said above. For in that which is above, “He shall spare the helpless
and poor man,”3222 there is understood “from usuries:” but in that which there he saith,
“and the souls of the poor He shall save;” there seemeth to have been implied, “from iniquity:”
so that the words “He shall redeem,” are understood with both. So when He shall spare the
poor and helpless man, and shall save the souls of the poor: thus “from usuries and iniquity
He shall redeem the souls of them. And honourable shall be the name of Him in the presence
of them.” For they give honour to His name for so great benefits, and they respond that

“meet and right it is”3223 to render thanks to the Lord their God. Or, as some copies have
it, “and honourable is the name of them in the presence of Him:” for even if Christians seem
despicable to this world, the name of them in the presence of Him is honourable, who to
them hath given it, no longer remembering those names in His lips, whereby before they
used to be called, when they were bound fast by the superstitions of the Gentiles, or signed
with names derived from their own evil deserts, before they were Christians, which name
is honourable in the presence of Him, even if it seemeth despicable to enemies.
17. “And He shall live, and there shall be given to Him of the gold of Arabia” (ver. 15).
There would not have been said, “and He shall live” (for of whom could not this be said,
though living for ever so brief a space of time on this earth?) unless that life were being re-
commended to our notice, wherein He “dieth no more, and death over Him shall have no
more dominion.”3224 And thus, “and He shall live,” that was despised in death: for, as an-
other Prophet saith, “there shall be taken away from the earth the life of Him.”3225 But what
is, “and there shall be given to Him of the gold of Arabia”? For the fact that from thence
even the former Salomon received gold, in this Psalm hath been in a figure transferred unto
another true Salomon, that is, the true Peace-maker. For the former did not have dominion
“from the river even unto the ends of the round world.”3226 Thus then hath been prophesied,
that even the wise men of this world in Christ would believe. But by Arabia we understand
the Gentiles; by gold wisdom which doth as much excel among all doctrines as gold among
metals. Whence hath been written, “Receive ye prudence as silver,3227 and wisdom as proved
gold.”3228 “And they shall pray concerning Himself alway.” That which the Greek hath,
περὶ αὐτοῦ, some have interpreted by “concerning Himself,” some “for Himself,” or “for
Him.” But what is, “concerning Himself,” except perchance that for which we pray, saying,
“Thy kingdom come”?3229 For Christ’s coming shall make present to believers the kingdom
of God. But how to understand “for Him” is difficult; except that when prayer is made for
the Church, for Himself prayer is made, because she is His Body. For concerning Christ and
the Church hath been sent before a great Sacrament,3230 “there shall be two in one flesh.”

Psalm LXXII
But now that which followeth, “all the day long,” that is, in all time, “they shall bless Him,”
is sufficiently evident.
18. “And there shall be a firmament on the earth, on the tops of the mountains” (ver.
16). For, “all the promises of God in Him are Yea,”3231 that is, in Him are confirmed: because
in Him hath been fulfilled whatever hath been prophesied for our salvation. For the tops of
the mountains it is meet to understand as the authors of the divine Scriptures, that is, those
persons through whom they were supplied: wherein He is indeed Himself the Firmament:
for unto Him all things that have been divinely written are ascribed. But this He willed
should be on earth; because for the sake of those that are upon earth, they were written.
Whence He came also Himself upon earth, in order that He might confirm all these things,
that is, in Himself might show them to have been fulfilled. “For it was necessary,” He saith,
“for all things to be fulfilled which were written in the Law, and the Prophets, and Psalms,
concerning Me:”3232 that is, “in the tops of the mountain.”3233 For so there cometh in the
last time the evident Mount of the Lord, prepared on the summit of the mountains: of which
here he speaketh, “in the tops of the mountains.” “Highly superexalted above Libanus shall
be His fruit.” Libanus we are wont to take as this world’s dignity: for Libanus is a mountain
bearing tall trees, and the name itself is interpreted whiteness.3234 For what marvel, if above
every brilliant state of this world there is superexalted the fruit of Christ, of which fruit the
lovers have contemned all secular dignities? But if in a good sense we take Libanus, because
of the “cedars of Libanus which He hath planted:”3235 what other fruit must be understood,
that is being exalted above this Libanus, except that whereof the Apostle speaketh when he
is going to speak concerning that love of his, “yet a pre-eminent way to you I show”?3236
For this is put forward even in the first rank of divine gifts, in the place where he saith, “but
the fruit of the Spirit is love:”3237 and with this are conjoined the remaining words as con-
sequent. “And they shall flourish from the city like hay of the earth.” Because city is used
ambiguously, and there is not annexed of Him, or of God, for there hath not been said,
“from the city” of Him, or “from the city” of God, but only “from the city:” in a good sense

it is understood, in order that from the city of God, that is, from the Church, they may
flourish like grass; but grass bearing fruit, as is that of wheat: for even this is called grass3238
in Holy Scripture; as in Genesis3239 there is a command for the earth to bring forth every
tree and every grass, and there is not added every wheat: which without doubt would not
have been passed over unless under the name of grass this also were understood; and in
many other passages of the Scriptures this is found. But if we must take, “and they shall
flourish like the grass of the earth,” in the same manner as is said, “all flesh is grass, and the
glory of a man like the flower of grass:” 3240 certainly then that city must be understood
which doth intimate this world’s society: for it was not to no purpose that Cain was the first
to build a city.3241 Thus the fruit of Christ being exalted above Libanus, that is, above endur-
ing trees and undecaying timbers, because He is the everlasting fruit, all the glory of a man
according to the temporal exaltation of the world is compared to grass; for by believers and
by men already hoping for life eternal temporal felicity is despised, in order that there may
be fulfilled that which hath been written, “all flesh is grass, and all the glory of flesh as the
flower of grass: the grass hath dried, the flower hath fallen off, but the word of the Lord doth
endure for ever.” There is the fruit of Him exalted above Libanus. For always flesh hath been
grass, and the glory of flesh as the flower of grass: but because it was not clearly proved what
felicity ought to have been chosen and preferred, the flower of grass was esteemed for a great
matter: not only it was by no means despised, but it was even chiefly sought after. As if
therefore at that time He shall have begun to be thus, when there is reproved and despised
whatever used to flourish in the world, thus hath been said, “superexalted above Libanus
shall be the fruit of Him, and they shall flourish from the city like grass of the earth:” that
is, glorified above all things shall be that which is promised for everlasting, and compared
to the grass of the earth shall be whatever is counted a great matter in the world.
19. “Be,” therefore, “the name of Him blessed for ever: before the sun endureth the name
of Him” (ver. 17). By the sun times are signified. Therefore for everlasting endureth the
name of Him. For eternity doth precede times, and is not bounded by time. “And there shall
be blessed in Him all the tribes of the earth.” For in Him is fulfilled that which hath been
promised to Abraham. “For He saith not, In seeds, as though in many; but as though in one,
And to thy Seed, which is Christ.”3242 But to Abraham is said, “In thy Seed shall be blessed
all the tribes of the earth.”3243 And not the sons of the flesh but the sons of promise are
3238 Fœnum.

counted in the Seed.3244 “All nations shall magnify Him.” As if in explanation there is re-
peated that which above hath been said. For because they shall be blessed in Him, they shall
magnify Him; not of themselves making Him to be great, that of Himself is great, but by
praising and confessing Him to be great. For thus we magnify God: thus also we say, “Hal-
lowed be Thy name,”3245 which is indeed always holy.
20. “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath done wonderful things alone” (ver.
18). Contemplating all things above spoken of, a hymn bursteth3246 forth; and the Lord
God of Israel is blessed. For that is being fulfilled which hath been spoken to that barren
woman, “and He that hath delivered Thee, the God of Israel, shall Himself be called of the
whole earth.”3247 “He doeth” Himself “marvellous things alone:” for whosoever do them,
He doth Himself work in them, “who doeth wonderful things alone.” “And blessed be the
name of His glory3248 for everlasting, and for age of age” (ver. 19). For what else should the
Latin interpreters have said, who could not have said for everlasting, and for everlasting of
everlasting? For it soundeth as if one thing were meant in the expression “for everlasting,”
and another thing in the expression “for age:” but the Greek hath εἰς τὸν αἰωνα, καὶ εἰς τὸν
αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος, which perchance more meetly might have been rendered by, “for age,
and for age of age:” so that by “for age,” might have been understood as long as this age3249
endureth; but “for age of age,” that which after the end of this is promised to be. “And there
shall be fulfilled with the glory of Him every land: so be it, so be it.” Thou hast commanded,
O Lord, so it is coming to pass: so it is coming to pass, until that which began with the river,
may attain fully even unto the ends of the round world.

whereof is written the name David, nowhere there is added, “son of Jesse,” except in this
alone. Which we must believe hath not been done to no purpose, nor capriciously. For
everywhere God doth make intimations to us, and to the understanding thereof doth invite
the godly study of love. What is, “there have failed the hymns of David, the son of Jesse”?
Hymns are praises of God accompanied with singing: hymns are songs containing the praise
of God. If there be praise, and it be not of God, it is no hymn: if there be praise, and God’s
praise, and it be not sung, it is no hymn. It must needs then, if it be a hymn, have these three
things, both praise, and that of God, and singing. What is then, “there have failed the hymns”?
There have failed the praises which are sung unto God. He seemeth to tell of a thing painful,
and so to speak deplorable. For he that singeth praise, not only praiseth, but only praiseth
with gladness: he that singeth praise, not only singeth, but also loveth him of whom he sin-
geth. In praise, there is the speaking forth of one confessing; in singing, the affection of one
loving. “There have failed” then “the hymns of David,” he saith: and he hath added, “the
son of Jesse.” For David was king of Israel, son of Jesse,3253 at a certain time of the Old
Testament, at which time the New Testament was therein hidden, like fruit in a root. For if
thou seek fruit in a root, thou wilt not find, and yet dost thou not find any fruit in the
branches, except that which hath gone forth from the root.…And in like manner as Christ
Himself to be born after the flesh was hidden in the root, that is in the seed of the Patriarchs,
and at a certain time must be revealed, as at the fruit appearing, according as it is written,
“there hath flourished a shoot from the root of Jesse:”3254 so also the New Testament itself
which is in Christ, in those former times was hidden, being known to the Prophets alone,
and to the very few godly men, not by the manifestation of things present, but by the revel-
ation of things future. For what meaneth it, brethren (to mention but one thing), that Abra-
ham sending his faithful servant to espouse a wife for his only son, maketh him swear to
him, and in the oath saith to him, “Put thy hand under my thigh, and swear”? 3255 What
was there in the thigh of Abraham, where he put his hand in swearing? What was there

there, except that which even then was promised to him, “In thy seed shall be blessed all
nations”?3256 Under the name of thigh, flesh is signified. From the flesh of Abraham, through
Isaac and Jacob, and not to mention many names, through Mary was our Lord Jesus Christ.
2. But that the root was in the Patriarchs, how shall we show? Let us question Paul. The
Gentiles now believing in Christ, and desiring as it were to boast over the Jews who crucified
Christ; although also from that same people there came another wall, meeting in the corner,
that is, in Christ Himself, the wall of uncircumcision, that is, of the Gentiles, coming from
a different quarter: when, I say, the nations were lifting up themselves, he doth thus depress
them. “For if thou,” he saith, “being cut out of the natural wild olive, hast been graffed in
among them, do not boast against the branches: for if thou boastest, thou dost not bear the
root, but the root thee.”3257 Therefore he speaketh of certain branches broken off from the
root of the Patriarchs because of unbelief, and the wild olive therein graffed in, that it might
be partaker of the fatness of the olive, that is, the Church coming out of the Gentiles. And
who doth graff the wild olive on the olive? The olive is wont to be graffed on the wild olive;
the wild olive on the olive we never saw. For whosoever may have done so will find no berries
but those of the wild olive. For that which is graffed in, the same groweth, and of that kind
the fruit is found. There is not found the fruit of the root but of the graft. The Apostle
showing that God did this thing by His Omnipotence, namely, that the wild olive should
be graffed into the root of the olive, and should not bear wild berries, but olive—ascribing
it to the Omnipotence of God, the Apostle saith this, “If thou hast been cut out of the natural
wild olive and against nature hast been graffed into a good 3258 olive, do not boast,” he saith,
“against the branches.”3259…
3. In the time then of the Old Testament, brethren, the promises from our God to that
carnal people were earthly and temporal. There was promised an earthly kingdom, there
was promised that land into which they were also led, after being delivered from Egypt: by
Jesus3260 son of Nave they were led into the land of promise, where also earthly Jerusalem
was builded, where David reigned: they received the land, after being delivered from Egypt,
by passing through the Red Sea.…Such were also those promises, which were not to endure,
through which however were figured future promises which were to endure, so that all that
course of temporal promises was a figure and a sort of prophecy of things future. Accordingly
when that kingdom was failing, where reigned David, the son of Jesse, that is, one that was

a man, though a Prophet, though holy, because he saw and foresaw Christ to come, of whose
seed also after the flesh He was to be born: nevertheless a man, nevertheless not yet Christ,
nevertheless not yet our King Son of God, but king David son of Jesse: because then that
kingdom was to fail, through the receiving of which kingdom at that time God was praised
by carnal men; for this thing alone they esteemed a great matter, namely, that they were
delivered temporally from those by whom they were being oppressed, and that they had
escaped from persecuting enemies through the Red Sea, and had been led through the desert,
and had found country and kingdom: for this alone they praised God, not yet perceiving
the thing which God was designing beforehand and promising in these figures. In the failing
therefore of those things for which the carnal people, over whom reigned that David, was
praising God, “there failed the hymns of David,” not the Son of God, but the “son of Jesse.”…
4. Whose voice is the Psalm? “Of Asaph.”3261 What is Asaph? As we find in interpreta-
tions from the Hebrew language into the Greek, and those again translated to us from the
Greek into the Latin, Asaph is interpreted Synagogue. It is the voice therefore of the Syn-
agogue. But when thou hast heard Synagogue, do not forthwith abhor it, as if it were the
murderer of the Lord. That Synagogue was indeed the murderer of the Lord, no man doubteth
it: but remember, that from the Synagogue were the rams whereof we are the sons. Whence
it is said in a Psalm, “Bring ye to the Lord the sons of rams.”3262 What rams are thence?
Peter, John, James, Andrew, Bartholomew, and the rest of the Apostles. Hence also he too
at first Saul, afterwards Paul: that is, at first proud, afterwards humble.…Therefore even
Paul came to us from the Synagogue, and Peter and the other Apostles from the Synagogue.
Therefore when thou hast heard the voice of the Synagogue, do not look to the deserving
thereof, but observe the offspring. There is speaking therefore in this Psalm, the Synagogue,
after the failing of the hymns of David, the son of Jesse that is, after the failing of things
temporal, through which God was wont to be praised by the carnal people. But why did
these fail, except in order that others might be sought for? That there might be sought for
what? Was it things which were not there? No, but things which were there being hidden
in figures: not which were not yet there,3263 but which there as it were in a sort were con-
cealed in certain secret things of mysteries. What things? “These,” saith the Apostle himself,
“were our figures.”3264…
5. It was the Synagogue therefore, that is, they that there worshipped God after a godly
sort, but yet for the sake of earthly things, for the sake of these present things (for there are
ungodly men who seek the blessings of present things from demons: but this people was on

Psalm LXXIII
this account better than the Gentiles, because although it were blessings present and tem-
poral, yet they sought them from the One God, who is the Creator of all things both spiritual
and corporal). When therefore those godly men after the flesh were observing—that is that
Synagogue which was made up of good men, men for the time good, not spiritual men, such
as were the Prophets therein, such as were the few that understood the kingdom heavenly,
eternal—that Synagogue, I say, observed what things it received from God, and what things
God promised to that people, abundance of things earthly, land, peace, earthly felicity: but
in all these things were figures, and they not perceiving what was there concealed in things
figured, thought that God gave this for a great matter, and had nothing better to give to men
loving Him and serving Him: they remarked and saw certain sinners, ungodly, blasphemers,
servants of demons, sons of the Devil, living in great naughtiness and pride, yet abounding
in such things earthly, temporal, for which sort of things they were serving God themselves:
and there sprang up a most evil thought in the heart, which made the feet to totter, and almost
slip out of God’s way. And behold this thought was in the people of the Old Testament: I
would it be not in our carnal brethren, when now openly there is being proclaimed the felicity
of the New Testament.…
6. “How good is the God of Israel!” But to whom? “To men right in heart” (ver. 1). To
men perverse what? Perverse He seemeth. So also in another Psalm He saith: “With a holy
man holy Thou shalt be, and with the innocent man innocent Thou shalt be, and with the
perverse man perverse Thou shalt be.”3265 What is, perverse Thou shalt be with the perverse
man? Perverse the perverse man shall think Thee. Not that by any means God is made per-
verse. Far be it: what He is, He is. But in like manner as the sun appeareth mild to one having
clear, sound, healthy, strong eyes, but against weak eyes doth dart hard spears, so to say; the
former looking at it it doth invigorate, the latter it doth torture, though not being itself
changed, but the man being changed: so when thou shalt have begun to be perverse, and to
thee God shall seem to be perverse, thou art changed, not He. That therefore to thee will be
punishment which to good men is joy. He calling to mind this thing, saith, “How good is
the God of Israel to men right in heart!”
7. But what to thee? “But my feet were almost moved” (ver. 2). When were the feet
moved, except when the heart was not right? Whence was the heart not right? Hear: “My
steps were well nigh overthrown.” What he hath meant by “almost,” the same he hath meant
by “well nigh:” and what he hath meant by “my feet were almost moved,” the same he hath
meant by “my steps were overthrown.” Almost my feet were moved, almost my steps were
overthrown. Moved were the feet: but whence were the feet moved and the steps overthrown?
Moved were the feet to going astray, overthrown were the steps to falling: not entirely, but
3265 Ps. xviii. 25.
Psalm LXXIII
“almost.” But what is this? Already I was going to stray, I had not gone: already I was falling,
I had not fallen.
8. But why even this? “For I was jealous,” he saith, “in the case of sinners, looking on
the peace of sinners” (ver. 3). I observed sinners, I saw them to have peace. What peace?
Temporal, transient, falling, and earthly: but yet such as I also was desiring of God. I saw
them that served not God to have that which I desired in order that I might serve God: and
my feet were moved and my steps were almost overthrown. But why sinners have this, he
saith briefly: “Because there is no avoidance of their death, and there is a firmament in their
scourge” (ver. 4). Now I have perceived, he saith, why they have peace, and flourish on the
earth; because of their death there is no avoidance, because death sure and eternal doth
await them, which neither doth avoid them, nor can they avoid it, “because there is no
avoidance of their death, and there is a firmament in their scourge.” And there is a firmament
in their scourge. For their scourge is not temporal, but firm for everlasting. Because of these
evil things then which are to be to them eternal, now what? “In the labours of men they are
not, and with men they shall not be scourged” (ver. 5). Doth not even the devil himself escape
scourging with men, for whom nevertheless an eternal punishment is being prepared?
9. Wherefore on this account what do these men, while they are not scourged, while
they labour not with men? “Therefore,” he saith “there hath holden them pride” (ver. 6).
Observe these men, proud, undisciplined; observe the bull, devoted for a victim, suffered
to stray at liberty; and to damage whatever he may, even up to the day of his slaughter. Now
it is a good thing, brethren, that we should hear in the very words of a prophet of this bull
as it were, whereof I have spoken. For thus of him the Scripture doth make mention in an-
other place: he saith that they are, as it were, made ready as for a victim, and that they are
spared for an evil liberty.3266 “Therefore,” he saith, “there hath holden them pride.” What
is, “there hath holden them pride”? “They have been clothed about with their iniquity and
ungodliness.” He hath not said, covered; but, “clothed about,” on all sides covered up with
their ungodliness. Deservedly miserable, they neither see nor are seen, because they are
clothed about; and the inward parts of them are not seen. For whosoever could behold the
inward parts of evil men, that are as it were happy for a time, whosoever could see their
torturing consciences, whosoever could examine their souls racked with such mighty per-
turbations of desires and fears, would see them to be miserable even when they are called
happy. But because “they are clothed about with their iniquity and ungodliness,” they see
not; but neither are they seen. The Spirit knew them, that saith these words concerning
them: and we ought to examine such men with the same eye as that wherewith we know
that we see, if there is taken from our eyes the covering of ungodliness.…
3266 Prov. vii. 22.
Psalm LXXIII
10. At first these men are being described. “There shall go forth as if out of fat their
iniquity” (ver. 7).…A poor beggar committeth a theft; out of leanness hath gone forth the
iniquity: but when a rich man aboundeth in so many things, why doth he plunder the things
of others? Of the former the iniquity out of leanness, of the other out of fatness, hath gone
forth. Therefore to the lean man when thou sayest, Why hast thou done this? Humbly afflicted
and abject he replieth, Need hath compelled me. Why hast thou not feared God? Want was
urgent. Say to a rich man, Why doest thou these things, and fearest not God?—supposing
thee to be great enough to be able to say it—see if he even deigneth to hear; see if even against
thyself3267 there will not go forth iniquity out of his fatness. For now they declare war with
their teachers and reprovers, and become enemies of them that speak the truth, having been
long accustomed to be coaxed with the words of flatterers, being of tender ear, of unsound
heart. Who would say to a rich man, Thou hast ill done in robbing other men’s goods? Or
perchance if any man shall have dared to speak, and he is such a man as he could not with-
stand, what doth he reply? All that he saith is in contempt of God. Why? Because he is proud.
Why? Because he is fat. Why? Because he is devoted for a victim. “They have passed over
unto purpose of heart.” Here within they have passed over. What is, “they have passed over”?
They have crossed over the way. What is, “they have passed over”? They have exceeded the
bounds of mankind, men like the rest they think not themselves. They have passed over, I
say, the bounds of mankind. When thou sayest to such a man, Thy brother this beggar is;
when thou sayest to such a man, Thy brother3268 this poor man is; the same parents ye have
had, Adam and Eve: do not heed thy haughtiness, do not heed the vapour unto which thou
hast been elevated; although an establishment waiteth about thee, although countless gold
and silver, although a marbled house doth contain thee, although fretted ceilings cover thee,
thou and the poor man together have for covering that roof of the universe, the sky; but
thou art different from the poor man in things not thine own, added to thee from without:
thyself see in them, not them in thee. Observe thyself, how thou art in relation to the poor
man; thyself, not that which thou hast. For why dost thou despise thy brother? In the bowels
of your mothers ye were both naked. Forsooth, even when ye shall have departed this life,
and these bodies shall have rotted, when the soul hath been breathed forth, let the bones of
the rich and poor man be distinguished! I am speaking of the equality of condition, of that
very lot of mankind, wherein all men are born:3269 for both here doth a man become rich,
and a poor man will not alway be here: and as a rich man doth not come rich, so neither
doth he depart rich; the very same is the entrance of both, and like is the departure. I add,
that perchance ye will change conditions. Now everywhere the Gospel is being preached:

Psalm LXXIII
observe a certain poor man full of sores, who was lying before the gate of a rich man,3270
and was desiring to be filled with crumbs, which used to fall from the table of the rich man;
observe also that likeness3271 of thine who was clothed with purple and fine linen, and fared
sumptuously every day. It chanced, I say, for that poor man to die, and to be borne by the
Angels into the bosom of Abraham: but the other died and was buried; for the other’s
burial perchance no one cared.…Brethren, how great was the toil of the poor man! Of how
long duration were the luxuries of the rich man! But the condition which they have received
in exchange is everlasting.…Deservedly too late he will say, “Send Lazarus,”3272 “let him
tell even my brethren;” since to himself there is not granted the fruit of repentance. For it
is not that repentance3273 is not given, but everlasting will be the repentance, and no salvation
after repentance. Therefore these men “have passed over unto purpose of heart.”
11. “They have thought and have spoken spitefulness” (ver. 8). But men do speak
spitefulness even with fear: but these men how? “Iniquity on high they have spoken.” Not
only they have spoken iniquity; but even openly, in the hearing of all, proudly; “I will do it;”
“I will show you;” “thou shalt know with whom thou hast to do;” “I will not let thee live.”
Thou3274 mightest have but thought such things, not have given utterance to them! Within
the chambers of thought at least the evil desire might have been confined, he might have at
least restrained it within his thought. Why? Is he perchance lean? “There shall go forth as
if out of fatness the iniquity of them.” “Iniquity on high they have spoken.”
12. “They have set against Heaven their mouth, and their tongue hath passed over above
the earth” (ver. 9). For this, “hath passed over above the earth” is, they pass over all earthly
things? What is it to pass over all earthly things? He doth not think of himself as a man that
can die suddenly, when he is speaking; he doth menace as if he were alway to live: his thought
doth transcend earthly frailty, he knoweth not with what sort of vessel he is enwrapped; he
knoweth not what hath been written in another place concerning such men: “His spirit shall
go forth, and he shall return unto his earth, in that day shall perish all his thoughts.”3275
But these men not thinking of their last day, speak pride,3276 and unto Heaven they set their
mouth, they transcend the earth. If a robber were not to think of his last day, that is, the last
day of his trial, when sent to prison, nothing would be more monstrous than he: and yet he

might escape. Whither dost thou flee to escape death? Certain will that day be. What is the
long time which thou hast to live? How much is the long time which hath an end, even if it
were a long time? To this there is added that it is nought: and the very thing which is called
long time is not a long time, and is uncertain. Why doth he not think of this? Because he
hath set against Heaven his mouth, and his tongue hath passed over above the earth. “And
full days shall be found in them.”
13. “Therefore there shall return hither My people” (ver. 10). Now Asaph himself is re-
turning hither. For he saw these things abound to unrighteous men, he saw them abound
to proud men: he is returning to God, and is beginning to inquire and discuss. But when?
“When full days shall be found in them.” What is “full days”? “But when there came the
fulness of time, God sent His Son.”3277 This is the very fulness of time, when He came to
teach men that things temporal should be despised, that they should not esteem as a great
matter whatever object evil men covet, that they should suffer whatever evil men fear. He
became the way, He recalled us to inward thought, admonished us of what should be sought
of God. And see from what thought reacting upon itself, and in a manner recalling the waves
of its impulse, he doth pass over unto choosing true things.
14. “And they said, How hath God known, and is there knowledge in the Most High?”
(ver. 11). See through what thought they pass. Behold unjust men are happy, God doth not
care for things human. Doth He indeed know what we do? See what things are being said.
We are inquiring, brethren, “How hath God known,” etc. (no longer let Christians say it).
For how doth it appear to thee that God knoweth not, and that there is no knowledge in the
Most High? He replieth, “Lo! themselves they are sinners, and in the world they have gotten
abundant riches” (ver. 12). Both sinners they are, and in the world they have gotten
abundant riches. He confessed that he willed not to be a sinner in order that he might have
riches. A carnal soul for things visible and earthly would have sold its justice. What sort of
justice is that which is retained for the sake of gold, as if gold were a more precious thing
than justice herself, or as if when a man denieth the deposit of another man’s goods, he to
whom he denied them should suffer a greater loss, than he that denieth them to him. The
former doth lose a garment, the latter fidelity. “Lo! they are themselves sinners, and in the
world they have gotten abundant riches.” On this account therefore God knoweth not, and
on this account there is no knowledge in the Most High.
15. “And I said, therefore3278 without cause I have justified my heart” (ver. 13). In that
I serve God, and have not these things; they serve him not, and they abound in these things:
“therefore without cause I have justified my heart, and have washed among the innocent
my hands.” This without cause I have done. Where is the reward of my good life? Where is
3277 Gal. iv. 4.
3278 mss. want “therefore.”
Psalm LXXIII
the wage of my service? I live well and am in need; and the unjust man doth abound. “And
I have washed among the innocent my hands. And I have been scourged all the day long”
(ver. 14). From me the scourges of God do not impart. I serve well, and I am scourged; he
serveth not, and is honoured. He hath proposed to himself a great question. The soul is
disturbed, the soul doth pass over things which are to pass away unto despising things earthly
and to desiring things eternal. There is a passage of the soul herself in this thought; where
she doth toss in a sort of tempest she will reach the harbour. And it is with her as it is with
sick persons, who are less violently sick, when recovery is far off: when recovery is at hand
they are in higher fever; physicians call it the “critical3279 accession” through which they
pass to health: greater fever is there, but leading to health: greater heat, but recovery is at
hand. So also is this man enfevered. For these are dangerous words, brethren, offensive, and
almost blasphemous, “How hath God known?” This is why I say, “and almost;” He hath not
said, God hath not known: he hath not said, there is no knowledge in the Most High: but
as if inquiring, hesitating, doubting. This is the same as he said a little before, “My steps
were almost overthrown.”3280 He doth not affirm it, but the very doubt is dangerous. Through
danger he is passing to health. Hear now the health: “Therefore in vain I have justified my
heart, and have washed among the innocent my hands: and I have been scourged all the day
long, and my chastening was in the morning.” Chastening is correction. He that is being
chastened is being corrected. What is, “in the morning”? It is not deferred. That of the un-
godly is being deferred, mine is not deferred: the former is too late or is not at all; mine is
in the morning.
16. “If I said, I shall declare thus; behold, the generation of Thy sons I have reprobated”
(ver. 15): that is, I will teach thus. How wilt thou teach? that there is no knowledge in the
Most High, that God doth not know? Wilt thou propound this opinion, that without cause
men live justly who do live justly; that a just man hath lost his service, because God doth
more show favour to evil men, or else He doth care for no one? Wilt thou tell this, declare
this? He doth restrain himself by an authority repressing him. What authority? A man
wisheth some time to break out in this sentiment: but he is recalled by the Scriptures directing
us alway to live well, saying, that God doth care for things human, that He maketh a distinc-
tion between a godly man and an ungodly man. Therefore this man also wishing to put
forth this sentiment, doth recollect himself. And what saith he? “I have reprobated the
generation of Thy sons.” If I shall declare thus, the generation of just men I shall reprobate.
As also some copies have it, “Behold, the generation of thy sons with which I have been in
concert:” that is, with which consisting of Thy sons I have been in concert; that is, with
which I have agreed, to which I have been conformed: I have been out of time with all, if so
3279 mss. creticam.
3280 Ps. lxxiii. 2.
Psalm LXXIII
I teach. For he doth sing in concert who giveth the tune together; but he that giveth not the
tune together doth not sing in concert. Am I to say something different from that which
Abraham said, from that which Isaac said, from that which Jacob said, from that which the
Prophets said? For all they said that God doth care for things human, am I to say that He
careth not? Is there greater wisdom in me than in them? Greater understanding in me than
in them? A most wholesome authority hath called back his thought from ungodliness. And
what followeth? That he might not reprobate, he did what? “And I undertook to know” (ver.
16). May God be with him in order that he may know. Meanwhile, brethren, from a great
fall he is being withheld, when he doth not presume that he already knoweth, but hath un-
dertaken to know that which he knew not. For but now he was willing to appear as if
knowing, and to declare that God hath no care of things human. For this hath come to be
a most naughty and ungodly doctrine of unrighteous men. Know, brethren, that many men
dispute and say that God careth not for things human, that by chances all things are ruled,
or that our wills have been made subject to the stars, that each one is not dealt with according
to his deserts, but by the necessity of his stars,—an evil doctrine, an impious doctrine. Unto
these thoughts was going that man whose feet were almost moved, and whose steps were
all but overthrown, into this error he was going; but because he was not in tune with the
generation of the sons of God, he undertook to know, and condemned the knowledge
wherein with God’s just men he agreed not. And what he saith let us hear; how that he un-
dertook to know, and was helped, and learned something, and declared it to us. “And I un-
dertook,” he saith, “to know.” “In this labour is before me.” Truly a great labour; to know
in what manner both God doth care for things human, and it is well with evil men, and
good men labour. Great is the importance of the question; therefore, “and this labour is
before me.” As it were there is standing in my face a sort of wall, but thou hast the voice of
a Psalm, “In my God I shall pass over the wall.”3281
17. …And he hath done this; for he saith how long labour is before him; “until I enter
into the sanctuary of God, and understand upon the last things” (ver. 17). A great thing it
is, brethren: now for a long time I labour, he saith, and before my face I see a sort of insuper-
able labour, to know in what manner both God is just, and doth care for things human, and
is not unjust because men sinning and doing wicked actions have happiness on this earth;
but the godly and men serving God are wasted ofttimes in trials and in labours; a great dif-
ficulty it is to know this, but only “until I enter into the Sanctuary of God.” For in the
Sanctuary what is presented to thee, in order that thou mayest solve this question? “And I
understand,” he saith, “upon the last things:” not present things. I, he saith, from the Sanc-
tuary of God stretch out mine eye unto the end, I pass over present things. All that which
is called the human race, all that mass of mortality is to come to the balance, is to come to
3281 Ps. xviii. 29.
Psalm LXXIII
the scale, thereon will be weighed the works of men. All things now a cloud doth enfold:
but to God are known the merits of each severally. “And I understand,” he saith, “upon the
last things:” but not of myself; for before me there is labour. Whence “may I understand
upon the last things”? Let me enter into the Sanctuary of God. In that place then he under-
stood also the reason why these men now are happy.
18. To wit, “because of deceitfulness Thou hast set upon them” (ver. 18). Because deceitful
they are, that is fraudulent; because deceitful they are, they suffer deceits. What is this, because
fraudulent they are they suffer a fraud? They desire to play a fraud upon mankind in all
their naughtinesses, they themselves also suffer a fraud, in choosing earthly good things,
and in forsaking the eternal. Therefore, brethren, in their very playing off a fraud they suffer
a fraud. In that which but now I said, brethren, “What manner of wit3282 hath he who to
gain a garment doth lose his fidelity?” hath he whose garment he hath taken suffered a fraud,
or he that is smitten with so great a loss? If a garment is more precious than fidelity, the
former doth suffer the greater loss: but if incomparably good faith doth surpass the whole
world, the latter shall seem to have sustained the loss of a garment; but to the former is said,
“What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world, but suffer the loss of his own soul?”3283
Therefore what hath befallen them? “Because of deceitfulness Thou hast set for them: Thou
didst throw them down while they were being exalted.” He hath not said, Thou didst throw
them down because they were lifted up: not as it were after that they were lifted up Thou
didst throw them down; but in their very lifting up they were thrown down. For thus to be
lifted up is already to fall.
19. “How have they become a desolation suddenly?” (ver. 19). He is wondering at them,
understanding unto the last things. “They have vanished.” Truly like smoke, which while it
mounteth upward, doth vanish, so they have vanished. How doth he say, “They have van-
ished”? In the manner of one who understandeth the last things: “they have perished because
of their iniquity.” “Like as the dream of one rising up” (ver. 20). How have they vanished?
As vanisheth the dream of one rising up. Fancy a man in sleep to have seen himself find
treasures; he is a rich man, but only until he awaketh. “Like as the dream of one rising up:”
so they have vanished, like the dream of one awaking. It is sought then and it is not: there
is nothing in the hands, nothing in the bed. A poor man he went to sleep, a rich man in
sleep he became: had he not awoke, he were a rich man: he woke up, he found the care which
he had lost while sleeping. And these men shall find the misery which they had prepared
for themselves. When they shall have awoke from this life, that thing doth pass away which
was grasped as if in sleep. “Like as the dream of one rising up.” And that there might not
be said, “What then? a small thing doth their glory seem to thee, a small thing doth their
3282 Cor.
3283 Matt. xvi. 26.
Psalm LXXIII
state seem to thee, small things seem to thee inscriptions, images, statues, distinctions, troops
of clients?” “O Lord,” he saith, “in Thy city their image3284 Thou shalt bring to nothing.”…He
hath taken away the pride of rich men, he giveth counsel.3285 As if they3286 were saying,
We are rich men, thou dost forbid us to be proud, dost prohibit us from boasting of the
parade of our riches: what then are we to do with these riches? Is it come to this, that there
is nothing which they may do therewith? “Be they rich,” he saith, “in good works; let them
readily distribute, communicate.”3287 And what doth this profit? “Let them treasure unto
themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of true life.”3288 Where
ought they to lay up treasure for themselves? In that place whereunto he set his eye, when
entering into the Sanctuary of God. Let there shudder all our rich brethren, abounding in
money, gold, silver, household, honours, let them shudder at that which but now hath been
said, “Thou shalt bring to nothing their image.” Are they not worthy to suffer these things,
to wit that God bring to nothing their image in His city, because also they have themselves
brought to nothing the image of God in their earthly city?
20. “Because my heart was delighted” (ver. 21). He is saying with what things he is
tempted: “because my heart was delighted,” he saith, “my reins also were changed.” When
those temporal things delighted me, my reins were changed. It may also be understood thus:
“because my heart was delighted” in God, “my reins also were changed, that is, my lusts
were changed, and I became wholly chaste. “My reins were changed.” And hear how. “And
I was brought unto nothing, and I knew not” (ver. 22). I, the very man, who now say these
things of rich men, once longed for such things: therefore “even I was brought to nothing”
when my steps were almost overthrown. “And I was brought unto nothing, and I knew not.”
We must not therefore despair even of them, against whom I was saying such things.
21. What is, “I knew not”? “As it were a beast I became to Thee, and I am alway with
Thee” (ver. 23). There is a great difference between this man and others. He became as it
were a beast in longing for earthly things, when being brought to nothing he knew not things
eternal: but he departed not from his God, because he did not desire these things of demons,
of the devil. For this I have already brought to your notice. The voice is from the Synagogue,
that is, from that people which served not idols. A beast indeed I became, when desiring
from my God things earthly: but I never departed from That my God.

Psalm LXXIII
22. Because then, though having become a beast, I departed not from my God, there
followeth, “Thou hast held the hand of my right hand.” He hath not said my right hand, but
“the hand of my right hand.” If the hand of the right hand it is, a hand hath a hand. “The
hand Thou hast held of my right hand,” in order that Thou mightest conduct me. For what
hath he put hand? For power. For we say that a man hath that in his hand which he hath in
his power: just as the devil said to God concerning Job, “Lay to Thine hand, and take away
the things which he hath.”3289 What is, lay to Thine hand? Put3290 forth power. The hand
of God he hath called the power of God: as hath been written in another place, “death and
life are in the hands of the tongue.”3291 Hath the tongue hands? But what is, in the hands
of the tongue? In the power of the tongue. What is, in the power of the tongue? “Out of thy
mouth thou shalt be justified, and out of thy mouth thou shalt be condemned.”3292 “Thou
hast held,” therefore, “the hand of my right hand,” the power of my right hand. What was
my right hand? That I was alway with Thee. Unto the left I was holding, because I became
a beast, that is, because there was an earthly concupiscence in me: but the right was mine,
because I was alway with thee. Of this my right hand Thou hast held the hand, that is, hast
directed the power. What power? “He gave them power to become sons of God.” 3293 He
is beginning now to be among the sons of God, belonging to the New Testament. See in
what manner the hand of his right hand was held. “In Thy will Thou hast conducted me.”
What is, “in thy will”? Not in my merits. What is, “in Thy will”? Hear the apostle, who was
at first a beast longing for things earthly, and living after the Old Testament. He saith what?
“I that at first was a blasphemer, and persecutor, and injurious: but mercy I obtained.”3294
What is, “in Thy will”? “By the grace of God I am what I am.”3295 “And in3296 glory Thou
hast taken me up.” Now to what glory he was taken up, and in what glory, who can explain,
who can say? Let us await it, because in the Resurrection it will be, in the last things it will
be.
23. And he is beginning to think of that same Heavenly felicity, and to reprove himself,
because he hath been a beast, and hath longed for things earthly. “For what have I in Heaven,
and from Thee what have I willed upon earth?” (ver. 25). By your voice I see that ye have
understood.3297 He compared with his earthly will the heavenly reward which he is to receive;

Psalm LXXIII
he saw what was there being reserved for him; and while thinking and burning at the thought
of some ineffable thing, which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor into the heart of
man hath ascended,3298 he hath not said, this or that I have in Heaven, but, “what have I in
Heaven?” What is that thing which I have in Heaven? What is it? How great is it? Of what
sort is it? “And,” since that which I have in heaven doth not pass away, “from Thee what
have I willed upon earth?”3299…Thou reservest, he saith, for me in Heaven riches immortal,
even Thyself, and I have willed from Thee on earth that which even ungodly men have,
which even evil men have, which even abandoned men have, money, gold, silver, jewels,
households, which even many wicked men have: which even many profligate women have,
many profligate men: these things as a great matter I have desired of my God upon earth:
though my God reserveth Himself for me in Heaven!
24. “My heart and my flesh hath failed, O God of my heart” (ver. 26). This then for me
in Heaven hath been reserved, “God of my heart, and my portion is my God.” What is it,
brethren? Let us find out our riches, let mankind choose their parts. Let us see men torn
with diversity of desires: let some choose war-service, some advocacy, some divers and
sundry offices of teaching, some merchandise, some farming, let them take their portions
in human affairs: let the people of God cry, “my portion is my God.” Not for a time “my
portion;” but “my portion is my God for everlasting.” Even if I alway have gold, what have
I? Even if I did not alway have God, how great a good should I have? To this is added, that
He promiseth Himself to me, and He promiseth that I shall have this for everlasting. So
great a thing I have, and never have it not. Great felicity: “my portion is God!” How long?
“For everlasting.” For behold and see after what sort He hath loved him; He hath made his
heart chaste: “God of my heart, and my portion is God for everlasting.” His heart hath become
chaste, for nought now God is loved, from Him is not sought any other reward. He that
doth seek any other reward from God, and therefore is willing to serve God, more precious
doth make that which he willeth to receive, than Him from whom he willeth to receive.
What then, is there no reward belonging to God? None except Himself. The reward belonging
to God, is God Himself. This he loveth, this he esteemeth; if any other thing he shall have
loved, the love will not be chaste. Thou art receding from the Fire immortal, thou wilt grow
cold, wilt be corrupted. Do not recede. Recede not, it will be thy corruption, it will be thy
fornication. Now he is returning, now he is repenting, now he is choosing repentance, now
he is saying, “my portion is God.” And after what sort is he delighted with that Same, whom
he hath chosen for his portion.

Psalm LXXIII
25. “Behold, they that put themselves afar from Thee shall perish” (ver. 27). He therefore
departed from God, but not far: for “I have become as it were a beast,” he saith, and “I am
alway with Thee.”3300 But they have departed afar, because not only things earthly they have
desired, but have sought them from demons and the Devil. “They that put themselves afar
from Thee shall perish.” And what is it, to become afar from God? “Thou hast destroyed
every man that committeth fornication away from Thee.” To this fornication is opposed
chaste love. What is chaste love? Now the soul doth love her Bridegroom: what doth she
require of Him, from Her Bridegroom whom she loveth? Perchance in like manner as women
choose for themselves men either as sons-in-law or as bridegrooms: she perchance chooseth
riches, and loveth his gold, and estates, and silver and cattle and horses, and household, and
the like. Far be it. He doth love Him alone, for nought he doth love Him: because in Him
he hath all things, for “by Him were made all things.”3301
26. But thou doest what? “But for me to cleave to God is a good thing” (ver. 28). This
is whole good. Will ye have more? I grieve at your willing. Brethren, what will ye have more?
Than to cleave to God nothing is better, when we shall see Him face to face.3302 But now
what? For yet as a stranger I am speaking: “to cleave,” he saith, “to God is a good thing:”
but now in my sojourning (for not yet hath come the substance), I have “to put in God my
hope.” So long therefore as thou hast not yet cloven, therein put thy hope. Thou art wavering,
cast forward an anchor to the land.3303 Not yet dost thou cleave by presence, cleave fast by
hope. “To put in God my hope.” And by doing what here wilt thou put in God thy hope?
What will be thy business, but to praise Him whom thou lovest, and to make others to be
fellow-lovers of Him with thee? Lo, if thou shouldest love a charioteer, wouldest thou not
carry along other men to love him with thee? A lover of a charioteer whithersoever he goeth
doth speak of him, in order that as well as he others also may love him. For nought are loved
abandoned men, and from God is reward required in order that He may be loved? Love
thou God for nought, grudge God to no one.…For what followeth? “In order that I may tell
forth all Thy praises in the courts of the daughter of Sion.” “In the courts:” for the preaching
of God beside the Church is vain. A small thing it is to praise God and to tell forth all His
praise. In the courts of the daughter of Sion tell thou forth. Make for unity, do not divide
the people; but draw them unto one, and make them one. I have forgotten how long I have
been speaking. Now the Psalm being ended, even judging by this closeness,3304 I suppose

Psalm LXXIII
Psalm LXXIV.3306
1. This Psalm’s Title is, “Of the Understanding of Asaph.” Asaph in Latin is translated
congregation, in Greek Synagogue. Let us see what this Synagogue hath understood. But let
us understand firstly Synagogue: from thence we shall understand what the Synagogue hath
understood. Every congregation is spoken of under the general name of Synagogue: one
both of beasts and of men may be called a congregation; but here there is no congregation
of beasts when we heard “understanding.”…for this the Psalm’s Title doth prescribe, saying,
“Of the understanding of Asaph.” It is therefore a certain understanding congregation
whereof we are about to hear the voice. But since properly Synagogue is said of the congreg-
ation of the people of Israel, so that wheresoever we may have heard Synagogue, we are no
longer wont to understand any but the people of the Jews; let us see whether perchance the
voice in this Psalm be not of that same people. But of what sort of Jews and of what sort of
people of Israel? For they are not of the chaff, but perchance of the grain;3307 not of the
broken branches, but perchance of those that are strengthened. “For not all that are of Israel
are Israelites.”3308…There are therefore certain Israelites, of whom was he concerning whom
was said, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom guile is not.”3309 I do not say in the same
manner as we are Israelites, for we also are the seed of Abraham. For to the Gentiles the
Apostle was speaking, when he said, “Therefore the seed of Abraham ye are, heirs according
to promise.”3310 According to this therefore all we are Israelites, that follow the footsteps
of the faith of our father Abraham. But let us understand here the voice of the Israelites in
the same manner as the Apostle saith, “For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham,
of the tribe of Benjamin.”3311 Here therefore let us understand that whereof the Prophets
have spoken, “a remnant shall be saved.”3312 Of the remnant therefore saved let us hear in
this place the voice; in order that there may speak that Synagogue which had received the
Old Testament, and was intent upon carnal promises; and by this means it came to pass
that their feet were shaken. For in another Psalm, where too the title hath Asaph, there is
said what? “How good is the God of Israel to men right in heart. But my feet were almost
moved.”3313 And as if we were saying, whence were thy feet moved? “Well nigh,” he saith,
“my steps were overthrown, because I was jealous in the case of sinners, looking on the

peace of sinners.”3314 For while according to the promises of God belonging to the Old
Testament he was looking for earthly felicity, he observed it to abound with ungodly men;
that they who worshipped not God were enriched with those things which he was looking
for from God: and as though without cause he had served God, his feet tottered.…But op-
portunely it hath chanced not by our own but by God’s dispensation, that just now we heard
out of the Gospel, that “the Law was given by Moses, Grace and Truth came by Jesus
Christ.”3315 For if we distinguish between the two Testaments, Old and New, there are not
the same Sacraments3316 nor the same promises;3317 nevertheless, the same command-
ments3318 for the most part.…When examined they are either all found to be the same, or
there are scarce any in the Gospel which have not been spoken by the Prophets. The Com-
mandments are the same, the Sacraments are not the same, the Promises are not the same.
Let us see wherefore the commandments are the same; because according to these we ought
to serve God. The Sacraments are not the same, for some Sacraments there are giving Salva-
tion, others promising a Saviour. The Sacraments of the New Testament give Salvation, the
Sacraments of the Old Testament did promise a Saviour.3319 When therefore thou hast now
the things promised, why dost thou seek the things promising, having now the Saviour?…God
through the New Testament hath taken out of the hands of His sons those things which are
like the playthings of boys, in order that He might give something more useful to them
growing up, on that account must He be supposed not to have given those former things
Himself. He gave both Himself. But the Law itself through Moses was given, Grace and
Truth came through Jesus Christ:3320 Grace because there is fulfilled through love that
which by the letter was being enjoined, Truth because there is being rendered that which
was promised. This thing therefore this Asaph hath understood. In a word, all things which
to the Jews had been promised have been taken away. Where is their kingdom? Where the
Temple? Where the Anointing? Where is Priest? Where are now the Prophets among them?
From what time there came He that by the Prophets was foretold, in that nation there is
now nothing of these things; now she hath lost things earthly, and not yet doth seek things
Heavenly.
2. Thou shouldest not therefore hold fast things earthly, although God doth bestow
them.…See ye how that in fearing to lose things earthly, the Jews slew the King of Heaven.

Psalm LXXIV
And what was done to them? They lost even those very things earthly: and in the place where
they slew Christ, there they were slain: and when, being unwilling to lose the land, they slew
the Giver of life, that same land being slain they lost; and at that very time when they slew
Him, in order that by that very time they might be admonished of the reason wherefore
they suffered these things. For when the city of the Jews was overthrown, they were celebrat-
ing the Passover, and with many thousands of men the whole nation itself had met together
for the celebration of that festival.3321 In that place God (through evil men indeed, but yet
Himself good; through unjust men, but Himself just and justly) did so take vengeance upon
them, that there were slain many thousands of men, and the city itself was overthrown. Of
this thing in this Psalm “the understanding of Asaph” doth complain, and in the very plaint
the understanding as it were doth distinguish things earthly from things heavenly, doth
distinguish the Old Testament from the New Testament: in order that thou mayest see
through what things thou art passing, what thou shouldest look for, what to forsake, to what
to cleave. Thus then he beginneth.
3. “Wherefore hast Thou repelled us, O God, unto the end?” (ver. 1). “Hast repelled
unto the end,” in the person of the congregation which is properly called Synagogue.
“Wherefore hast Thou repelled us, O God, unto the end?” He censureth not, but inquireth
“wherefore,” for what purpose, because of what hast Thou done this? What hast Thou done?
“Thou hast repelled us unto the end.” What is, “unto the end”? Perchance even unto the
end of the world. Hast Thou repelled us unto Christ, who is the End to every one believing?
3322 For, “Wherefore hast Thou repelled us, O God, unto the end?” “Thy spirit3323 hath
been wroth at the sheep of Thy flock.” Wherefore wast Thou wroth at the sheep of Thy flock,
but because to things earthly we were cleaving, and the Shepherd we knew not?
4. “Remember Thou Thy congregation, which Thou hast possessed from the beginning”
(ver. 2). Can this by any means be the voice of the Gentiles? Hath He possessed the Gentiles
from the beginning? Nay, but He hath possessed the seed of Abraham, the people of Israel
even according to the flesh, born of the Patriarchs our fathers: of whom we have become
the sons, not by coming out of their flesh, but by imitating their faith. But those, possessed
by God from the beginning, what befell them? “Remember Thy congregation which Thou
hast possessed from the beginning. Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance.” That
same congregation of Thine, being the rod of Thine inheritance, Thou hast redeemed. This
same congregation he hath called “the rod of the inheritance.” Let us look back to the first
3321 See Josephus, book vi. c. 9, § 3, whence the whole number of the besieged is stated at 1,197,000 of whom
1,100,000 perished. [The coincidence of the Passover with this day of retribution is noteworthy. On Good Friday
accordingly occurs a prayer for the Jews, in the Anglican Liturgy.—C.]

Psalm LXXIV
thing that was done, when He willed to possess that same congregation, delivering it from
Egypt, what sign He gave to Moses, when Moses said to Him, “What sign shall I give that
they may believe me, that Thou hast sent me? And God saith to him, What dost thou bear
in thine hand? A rod. Cast it on to the ground,” etc.3324 What doth it intimate? For this was
not done to no purpose. Let us inquire of the writings of God. To what did the serpent per-
suade man? To death.3325 Therefore death is from the serpent. If death is from the serpent,
the rod in the serpent is Christ in death.3326 Therefore also when by serpents in the desert
they were being bitten and being slain, the Lord commanded Moses to exalt a brazen serpent
in the desert, and admonish the people that whosoever by a serpent had been bitten, should
look thereupon and be made whole.3327 Thus also it was done: thus also men, bitten by
serpents, were made whole of the venom by looking upon a serpent.3328 To be made whole
of a serpent is a great Sacrament. What is it to be made whole of a serpent by looking upon
a serpent? It is to be made whole of death by believing in one dead. And nevertheless Moses
feared and fled.3329 What is it that Moses fled from that serpent? What, brethren, save that
which we know to have been done in the Gospel? Christ died and the disciples feared, and
withdrew from that hope wherein they had been.3330…But, at that time some thousands of
the Jews themselves, the crucifiers of Christ, believed: and because they had been found at
hand, they so believed as that they sold all that they had, and the price of their goods before
the feet of the Apostles they laid.3331 Because then this thing was hidden, and the redemption
of the rod of God was to be more conspicuous in the Gentiles: he explaineth of what he saith
that which he hath said, “Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance.” This he hath
said not of the Gentiles in whom it was evident. But of what? “Mount Sion.” Yet even Mount
Sion can be otherwise understood. “That one which3332 Thou hast dwelled in the same.”
In the place where the People was aforetime, where the Temple was set up, where the Sacri-
fices were celebrated, where at that time were all those necessary things giving promise of
Christ. A promise, when the thing promised is bestowed is now become superfluous.…

the end, so “lift up Thine hand upon the pride of them at the end.” The pride of whom? Of

those by whom Jerusalem was overthrown. But by whom was it, but by the kings of the
Gentiles? Well was the hand of Him lifted up upon the pride of them at the end: for they
too have now known Christ. “For the end of the Law is Christ for righteousness to every
one believing.”3333 How well doth he wish for them! As if angry he is speaking, and he is
seeming to speak evil:3334 and O that there would come to pass the evil which he speaketh:
nay now in the name of Christ that it is coming to pass let us rejoice. Now they holding the
sceptre are being made subject to the Word of the Cross: now is coming to pass that which
was foretold, “there shall adore Him all the kings of the earth, all nations shall serve Him.”3335
Now on the brows of kings more precious is the sign of the Cross, than the jewel of a crown.
“Lift up Thine hand upon the pride of them at the end. How great things hath the enemy
of malice wrought in Thy holy places!” In those which were Thy holy places, that is, in the
temple, in the priesthood, in all those sacraments which were at that time. In good sooth
the enemy at that time wrought. For the Gentiles at that time who did this, were worshipping
false Gods, were adoring idols, were serving demons: nevertheless they wrought many evil
things on the Saints of God. When could they if they had not been permitted? But when
would they have been permitted, unless those holy things, at first promised, were no longer
necessary, when He that had promised was Himself holden? Therefore, “how great things
hath the enemy of malice wrought in Thy holy places!”
6. “And all they have boasted, that hate Thee” (ver. 4). Observe the servants of demons,
the servants of idols: such as at that time the Gentiles were, when they overthrew the temple
and city of God, “and they boasted.” “In the midst of Thy festival.” Remember what I said,
that Jerusalem was overthrown at the time when the very festival was being celebrated: at
which festival they crucified the Lord. Gathered together they raged, gathered together they
perished. “They have set signs, their own signs, and they have not known” (ver. 5). They
had signs to place there, their standards, their eagles, their own dragons, the Roman signs;
or even their statues which at first in the temple they placed; or perchance “their signs” are
the things which they heard from the prophets of their demons. “And they have not known.”
Have not known what? How “thou shouldest have had no power against Me, except it had
been given thee from above.”3336 They knew not how that not on themselves honour was
conferred, to afflict, to take, or overthrow the city, but their ungodliness was made as it were
the axe of God. They were made the instrument of Him enraged, not so as to be the kingdom
of Him pacified. For God doth that which a man also ofttime doth. Sometimes a man in a
rage catcheth up a rod lying in the way, perchance any sort of stick, he smiteth therewith
3333 Rom. x. 4.
3334 Or, “curse.”
3335 Ps. lxxii. 11.
3336 John xix. 11.
Psalm LXXIV
his son, and then throweth the stick into the fire and reserveth the inheritance for his son:
so sometime God through evil men doth instruct good men, and through the temporal
power of them that are to be condemned He worketh the discipline of them that are to be
saved. For why do you suppose, brethren, that discipline was even thus inflicted upon that
nation, in order that it might perish utterly? How many out of this nation did afterwards
believe, how many are yet to believe? Some are chaff, others grain; over both however there
cometh in the threshing-drag; but under one threshing-drag the one is broken up, the other
is purged. How great a good hath God bestowed upon us by the evil of Judas the traitor! By
the very ferocity of the Jews how great a good was bestowed upon believing Gentiles! Christ
was slain in order that there might be on the Cross One for him to look to who had been
stung by the serpent.3337…
7. Now let us hasten over the verses following after the destruction of Jerusalem, for the
reason that they are both evident, and it doth not please me to tarry over the punishment
even of enemies. “As if in a forest of trees with axes, they have cut down the doors thereof
at once; with mattock and hammer they have thrown Her down” (ver. 6). That is, conspiring
together, with firm determination, “with mattock and hammer” they have thrown Her down.
“They have burned with fire Thy Sanctuary, they have defiled on the ground the Tabernacle
of Thy name” (ver. 7).
8. “They have said in their heart (the kindred of them is in one)”—Have said what?
“Come ye, let us suppress the solemnities of the Lord from the land” (ver. 8). “Of the Lord,”
hath been inserted in the person of this man, that is, in the person of Asaph. For they raging
would not have called Him the Lord whose temple they were overthrowing. “Come ye, let
us suppress all the solemnities of the Lord from the land.” What of Asaph? What understand-
ing hath Asaph in these words? What? Doth he not profit even by the discipline accorded?
Is not the mind’s crookedness made straight? Overthrown were all things that were at first:
nowhere is there priest, nowhere Altar of the Jews, nowhere victim, nowhere Temple. Is
there then no other thing to be acknowledged which succeeded this departing? Or indeed
would this promissory sign have been taken away, unless there had come that which was
being promised? Let us see therefore in this place now the understanding of Asaph, let us
see if he profiteth by tribulation. Observe what he saith: “Our signs we have not seen, no
longer is there prophet, and us He will not know as yet” (ver. 9). Behold those Jews who say
that they are not known as yet, that is, that they are yet in captivity, that not yet they are
delivered, do yet expect Christ. Christ will 3338 come, but He will come as Judge; the first
time to call, afterwards to sever. He will come, because He hath come,3339 and that He will

3338 Oxf. mss. “truly.”
3339 Oxf. mss. “He will come, that hath already come.”
Psalm LXXIV
come is evident; but hereafter from above He will come. Before thee He was, O Israel. Thou
wast bruised because thou didst stumble against Him lying down: that thou mayest not be
ground to powder, observe Him coming from above. For thus it was foretold by the
prophet: “Whoever shall stumble upon that stone shall be bruised, and upon whomsoever
it shall have come, it shall grind him to powder.”3340 He doth bruise when little, He shall
grind to powder when great. Now thy signs thou seest not, now there is no prophet: and
thou sayest, “and us He will not know as yet:” because yourselves know not Him as yet. “No
longer is there a prophet; and us He will not know as yet.”
9. “How long, O God, shall the enemy revile?” (ver. 10). Cry out as if forsaken, as if
deserted: cry out like a sick man, who hast chosen rather to smite the physician than to be
made whole: not as yet doth He know thee. See what He hath done, who doth not know
thee as yet. For they to whom there hath been no preaching of Him, shall see; and they that
have not heard shall understand: and thou yet criest out, “No longer is there a prophet, and
us He will not know as yet.”3341 Where is thine understanding? “The adversary doth provoke
Thy name at the end.”3342 For this purpose the adversary doth provoke Thy name at the
end, that being provoked Thou mayest reprove, reproving Thou mayest know them at the
end: or certainly, “at the end,” in the sense of even unto the end.
10. “Wherefore dost Thou turn away Thine hand, and Thy right hand from the midst
of Thy bosom unto the end?” (ver. 11). Again, another sign which was given to Moses. For
in like manner as above from the rod was a sign, so also from the right hand now. For when
that thing had been done concerning the rod, God gave a second sign: “thrust,” He saith,
“thine hand into thy bosom, and he thrust it: draw it forth, and he drew it forth: and it was
found white,”3343 that is, unclean. For whiteness on the skin is leprosy,3344 not fairness of
complexion. For the heritage of God itself, that is, His people, being cast out became unclean.
But what saith He to him? Draw it back into thy bosom. He drew it back, and it was restored
to its own colour. When doest Thou this, saith this Asaph? How long dost Thou alienate
Thy right hand from Thy bosom, so that being without unclean it remaineth? Draw it back,
let it return to its colour, let it acknowledge the Saviour. “Wherefore dost thou turn away
Thine hand, and Thy right hand from the midst of Thy bosom unto the end?” These words
he crieth, being blind, not understanding, and God doeth what He doeth. For wherefore
came Christ? “Blindness in part happened unto Israel, in order that the fulness of the Gentiles
might enter in, and so all Israel might be saved.”3345 Therefore now, O Asaph, acknowledge

that which hath gone before, in order that thou mayest at least follow, if thou wast not3346
able to go before. For not in vain came Christ, or in vain was Christ slain, or in vain did the
corn fall into the ground; but it fell that it might rise manifold.3347 A serpent was lifted up
in the desert, in order that it might cure of the poison him that was smitten.3348 Observe
what was done. Do not think it to be a vain thing that He came: lest He find thee evil, when
He shall have come a second time.
11. Asaph hath understood, because on the Title of the Psalm there is, “understanding
of Asaph.” And what saith he? “But God, our King before the worlds, hath wrought Salvation
in the midst of the earth” (ver. 12). On the one hand we cry, “No longer is there prophet,
and us He will not know as yet:”3349 but on the other hand, “our God, our King, who is before
the worlds” (for He is Himself in the beginning of the Word3350 by whom were made the
worlds), “hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth.” “God therefore, our King before
the worlds,” hath done what? “hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth:” and I am
yet crying as if forsaken!…Now the Gentiles are awake, and we are snoring, and as though
God hath forsaken us, in dreams we are delirious. “He hath wrought Salvation in the midst
of the earth.”
12. Now therefore, O Asaph, amend thyself according to thy understanding, tell us what
sort of Salvation God hath wrought in the midst of the earth. When that earthly Salvation
of yours was overthrown, what did He do, what did He promise? “Thou didst confirm in
Thy virtue the sea” (ver. 13). As though the nation of the Jews were as it were dry land
severed from the waves, the Gentiles in their bitterness were the sea, and on all sides they
washed about that land: behold, “Thou hast confirmed in Thy virtue the sea,” and the land
remained thirsting for Thy rain. “Thou hast confirmed in Thy virtue the sea, Thou hast
broken in pieces the heads of dragons in the water.” Dragons’ heads, that is, demons’ pride,
wherewith the Gentiles were possessed, Thou hast broken in pieces upon the water: for
those persons whom they were possessing, Thou by Baptism hast delivered.
13. What more after the heads of dragons? For those dragons have their chief, and he
is himself the first great dragon. And concerning him what hath He done that hath wrought
Salvation in the midst of the earth? Hear: “Thou hast broken the head of the dragon” (ver.
14). Of what dragon? We understand by dragons all the demons that war under the devil:
what single dragon then, whose head was broken, but the devil himself ought we to under-
stand? What with him hath He done? “Thou hast broken the head of the dragon.” That is,
3346 Oxf. mss. “wast unwilling, and wast not.”

Psalm LXXIV
the beginning of sin. That head is the part which received the curse, to wit that the seed of
Eve should mark the head of the serpent.3351 For the Church was admonished to shun the
beginning of sin. Which is that beginning of sin, like the head of a serpent? The beginning
of all sin is pride.3352 There hath been broken therefore the head of the dragon, hath been
broken pride diabolical. And what with him hath He done, that hath wrought Salvation in
the midst of the earth? “Thou hast given him for a morsel to the Ethiopian peoples.” What
is this? How do I understand the Ethiopian peoples? How but by these all nations? And
properly by black men: for Ethiopians are black. They are themselves called to the faith who
were black; the very same indeed, so that there is said to them, “for ye were sometime
darkness, but now light in the Lord.”3353…Thence was also that calf which the people
worshipped, unbelieving, apostate, seeking the gods of the Egyptians, forsaking Him who
had delivered them from the slavery of the Egyptians: whence there was enacted that great
Sacrament. For when Moses was thus wroth with them worshipping and adoring the idol,3354
and, inflamed with zeal for God, was punishing temporally, in order that he might terrify
them to shun death everlasting; yet the head itself of the calf he cast into the fire, and ground
to powder, destroyed, strawed on the water, and gave to the people to drink: so there was
enacted a great Sacrament. O anger prophetic, and mind not perturbed but enlightened!
He did what? Cast it into the fire, in order that first the form itself may be obliterated; piece
by piece grind it down, in order that little by little it may be consumed: cast it into the water,
give to the people to drink! What is this but that the worshippers of the devil were become
the body of the same? In the same manner as men confessing Christ become the Body of
Christ; so that to them is said, “but ye are the Body of Christ and the members.”3355 The
body of the devil was to be consumed, and that too by Israelites was to be consumed. For
out of that people were the Apostles, out of that people the first Church.…Thus the devil is
being consumed with the loss of his members. This was figured also in the serpent of Moses.
For the magicians did likewise, and casting down their rods they exhibited serpents: but the
serpent of Moses swallowed up the rods of all those magicians.3356 Let there be perceived
therefore even now the body of the devil: this is what is coming to pass, he is being devoured
by the Gentiles who have believed, he hath become meat for the Ethiopian peoples. This
again, may be perceived in, “Thou hast given him for meat to the Ethiopian peoples,” how
that now all men bite him. What is, bite him? By reproving, blaming, accusing. Just as hath

been said, by way of prohibition indeed, but yet the idea expressed: “but if ye bite and eat
up one another, take heed that ye be not consumed of one another.”3357 What is, bite and
eat up one another? Ye go to law with one another, ye detract from one another, ye heap
revilings upon one another. Observe therefore now how that with these bitings the devil is
being consumed. What man, when angry with his servant, even a heathen, would not say
to him, Satan?3358 Behold the devil given for meat. This saith Christian, this saith Jew, this
saith heathen:3359 him he worshippeth, and with him he curseth!…
14. “Thou hast cleft the fountains and torrents” (ver. 15): in order that they might flow
with the stream of wisdom, might flow with the riches of the faith, might water the saltness
of the Gentiles, in order that they might convert all unbelievers into the sweetness of the
faith by their watering.…In some men the Word of God becometh a well of water springing
up unto life eternal;3360 but others hearing the Word, and not so keeping it as that they live
well, yet not keeping silence with tongue, they become torrents. For they are properly called
torrents which are not perennial: for sometimes also in a secondary sense torrent is used
for river: as hath been said, “with the torrent of Thy pleasures Thou shalt give them to
drink.”3361 For that torrent shall not ever be dried up. But torrents properly are those rivers
named, which in summer fail, but with winter rains are flooded and run. Thou seest therefore
a man sound in faith, that will persevere even unto the end, that will not forsake God in any
trial; for the sake of the truth, not for the sake of falsehood and error, enduring all difficulties.
Whence is this man so vigorous, but because the Word hath become in him a well of water
springing up unto life eternal?3362 But the other receiveth the Word, he preacheth, he is not
silent, he runneth: but summer proveth whether he be fountain or torrent. Nevertheless
through both be the earth watered, by Him who hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the
earth: let the fountains overflow, let the torrents run.
15. “Thou hast dried up the rivers of Etham” (ver. 15).…What is Etham? For the word
is Hebrew. What is Etham interpreted? Strong, stout. Who is this strong and stout one,
whose rivers God drieth up? Who but that very dragon? For “no one entereth into the house
of a strong man that he may spoil his vessels, unless first he shall have bound fast the strong
man.”3363 This is that strong man on his own virtue relying, and forsaking God: this is that
strong man, who saith, “I will set my seat by the north, and I will be like the Most High.”3364

Out of that very cup of perverse strength he hath given man to drink. Strong they willed to
be, who thought that they would be Gods by means of the forbidden food. Adam became
strong, over whom was reproachfully said, “Behold, Adam hath become like one of
us.”3365…As though they were strong, “to the righteousness of God they have not been
made subject.”3366 Observe ye that a man hath put out of the way his own strength, and
remained weak, needy, standing afar off, not daring even to raise his eyes to Heaven; but
smiting his breast, and saying, “O Lord, merciful be Thou to me a sinner.”3367 Now he is
weak, now he confesseth his weakness, he is not strong: dry land he is, be he watered with
fountains and torrents. They are as yet strong who rely on their own virtue. Be their rivers
dried up, let there be no advancement in the doctrines of the Gentiles, of wizards, of astro-
logers, of magic arts: for dried up are the rivers of the strong man: “Thou hast dried up the
rivers of Etham.” Let there dry up that doctrine; let minds be flooded with the Gospel of
truth.
16. “Thine own is the day and Thine own is the night” (ver. 16). Who is ignorant of this,
seeing that He hath Himself made all these things; for by the Word were made all things?3368
To that very One Himself who hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth, to Him is
said, “Thine own is the night.” Something here we ought to perceive which belongeth to
that very Salvation which He hath wrought in the midst of the earth. “Thine own is the day.”
Who are these? The spiritual. “And Thine own is the night.” Who are these? The car-
nal.…“Thou hast made perfect sun and moon:” the sun, spiritual men, the moon, carnal
men. As yet carnal he is, may he not be forsaken, and may he too be made perfect. The sun,
as it were a wise man: the moon, as it were an unwise man: Thou hast not however forsaken.
For thus it is written, “A wise man endureth as the sun, but a foolish man as the moon is
changed.”3369 What then? Because the sun endureth, that is, because the wise man endureth
as the sun, a foolish man is changed like the moon, is one as yet carnal, as yet unwise, to be
forsaken? And where is that which hath been said by the Apostle, “To the wise and unwise
a debtor I am”?3370
17. “Thou hast made all the ends of the earth” (ver. 17).…Behold in what manner He
hath made the ends of the earth, that hath wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth. “Thou
hast made all the ends of the earth. Summer and spring Thou hast made them.” Men fervent
in the Spirit are the summer. Thou, I say, hast made men fervent in the Spirit: Thou hast

made also the novices in the Faith, they are the “spring.” “Summer and Spring Thou hast
made them.” They shall not glory as if they have not received: “Thou hast made them.”
18. “Mindful be Thou of this Thy creature” (ver. 18). Of what creature of Thine? “The
enemy hath reviled the Lord.” O Asaph, grieve over thine old blindness in understanding:
“the enemy hath reviled the Lord.” It was said to Christ in His own nation, “a sinner is this
Man: we know not whence He is:” we know Moses, to him spake God; this Man is a
Samaritan.3371 “And the unwise people hath provoked Thy name.” The unwise people Asaph
was at that time, but not the understanding of Asaph at that time. What is said in the former
Psalm? “As it were a beast I have become unto Thee, and I am alway with Thee:”3372 because
He went not to the gods and idols of the Gentiles. Although he knew not, being like a beast,
yet he knew again as a man. For he said, “alway I am with Thee, like a beast:” and what af-
terwards in that place in the same Psalm, where Asaph is? “Thou hast held the hand of my
right hand, in Thy will Thou hast conducted me, and with glory Thou hast taken me up.”3373
In Thy will, not in my righteousness: by Thy gift, not by my work. Therefore here also, “the
enemy hath reviled the Lord: and the unwise people hath provoked Thy name.” Have they
all then perished? Far be it.…For even the Apostle Paul through unbelief had been broken,
and through faith unto the root he was restored. So evidently “the unwise people provoked
Thy name,” when it was said, “If Son of God He is let Him come down from the Cross.”
19. But what sayest thou, O Asaph, now in understanding? “Deliver not to the beasts a
soul confessing to Thee” (ver. 19).…To what beasts, save to those the heads whereof were
broken in pieces upon the water? For the same devil is called, beast, lion, and dragon. Do
not, he saith, give to the Devil and his Angels a soul confessing to Thee. Let the serpent de-
vour, if still I mind things earthly, if for things earthly I long, if still in the promises of the
Old Testament, after the revealing of the New, I remain. But forasmuch as now I have laid
down pride, and my own righteousness I will not acknowledge, but Thy Grace; against me
let proud beasts have no power. “The souls of Thy poor forget Thou not unto the end.” Rich
we were, strong we were: but Thou hast dried up the rivers of Etham: no longer we establish
our own righteousness, but we acknowledge Thy Grace; poor we are, hearken to Thy beggars.
Now we do not dare to lift our eyes to Heaven, but smiting our breasts we say, “O Lord, be
Thou merciful to me a sinner.” 3375

20. “Have regard unto Thy Testament”3376 (ver. 20). Fulfil that which Thou hast
promised: the tables we have, for the inheritance we are looking. “Have regard unto Thy
Testament,” not that old one: not for the sake of the land of Canaan I ask, not for the sake
of the temporal subduing of enemies, not for the sake of carnal fruitfulness of sons, not for
the sake of earthly riches, not for the sake of temporal welfare: “Have regard unto Thy
Testament,” wherein Thou hast promised the kingdom of Heaven. Now I acknowledge Thy
Testament: now understanding is Asaph, no beast is Asaph, now he seeth that which was
spoken of, “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will accomplish with the House of
Israel and of Juda a new Testament, not after the Testament which I ordered3377 with their
Fathers.”3378 “Have regard unto Thy Testament: for they that have been darkened have
been filled of the earth of unrighteous houses:” because they had unrighteous hearts. Our
“houses” are our hearts: therein gladly dwell they that are blessed with pure heart.3379 “Have
regard,” therefore, “unto Thy Testament:” and let the remnant be saved:3380 for many men
that give heed to earth are darkened, and filled with earth. For there hath entered into their
eyes dust, and it hath blinded them, and they have become dust which the wind sweepeth
from the face of the earth.3381 “They that have been darkened have been filled of the earth
of unrighteous houses.” For by giving heed to earth they have been darkened, concerning
whom there is said in another Psalm, “Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not, and their
back ever bow Thou down.”3382 With earth, then, “they that have been darkened have been
filled, with the earth of unrighteous houses:” because they have unrighteous hearts.…
21. “Let not the humble man be turned away confounded” (ver. 21). For them pride
hath confounded. “The needy and helpless man shall praise Thy name.” Ye see, brethren,
how sweet ought to be poverty: ye see that poor and helpless men belong to God, but “poor
in spirit, for of them is the Kingdom of Heaven.”3383 Who are the poor in spirit? The humble,
men trembling at the words of God, confessing their sins, neither on their own merits, nor
on their own righteousness relying. Who are the poor in spirit? They who when they do
anything of good, praise God, when anything of evil, accuse themselves. “Upon whom shall
rest My Spirit,” saith the Prophet, “but upon the humble man, and peaceful, and trembling

at My words?”3384 Now therefore Asaph hath understood, now to the earth he adhereth
not, now the earthly promises out of the Old Testament he requireth not.…
22. “Arise, O Lord, judge Thou my cause”3385 (ver. 22).…Because I am not able to show
my God, as if I were following an empty thing, they revile me. And not only Heathen, or
Jew, or heretic; but sometimes even a Catholic brother doth make a grimace when the
promises of God are being preached, when a future resurrection is being foretold.3386 And
still even he, though already washed with the water of eternal Salvation, bearing the Sacrament
of Christ, perchance saith, “and what man hath yet risen again?” And, “I have not heard my
father speaking out of the grave, since I buried him!” “God hath given to His servants a law
for time, to which3387 let them betake themselves: for what man cometh back from beneath?”
And what shall I do with such men? Shall I show them what they see not? I am not able: for
not for the sake of them ought God to become visible.…I see not, he saith: what am I to
believe? Thy soul is seen then, I suppose? Fool, thy body is seen: thy soul who doth see?
Since therefore thy body alone is seen, why art thou not buried? He marvelleth that I have
said, If body alone is seen, why art thou not buried? And he answereth (for he knoweth as
much as this), Because I am alive. How know I that thou art alive, of whom I see not the
soul? How know I? Thou wilt answer, Because I speak, because I walk, because I work. Fool,
by the operations of the body I know thee to be living, by the works of creation canst thou
not know the Creator? And perchance he that saith, when I shall be dead, afterwards I shall
be nothing; hath both learned letters, and hath learned this doctrine from Epicurus, who
was a sort of doting philosopher, or rather lover of folly not of wisdom, whom even the
philosophers themselves have named the hog: who said that the “chief good” was pleasure
of body; this philosopher they3388 have named the hog, wallowing in carnal mire. From him
perchance this lettered man hath learned to say, I shall not be, after I have died. Dried be
the rivers of Etham! Perish those doctrines of the Gentiles, flourish the plantations of Jeru-
salem! Let them see what they can, in heart believe what they cannot see! Certainly all those
things which throughout the world now are seen, when God was working Salvation in the

behold at that time they were foretold, now they are shown as fulfilled, and still the fool
saith in his heart, “there is no God.”3389 Woe to the perverse hearts: for so will there come

were not, and were being foretold as to come to pass. Hath God indeed performed3390 to
us all the things which He promised, and concerning the Day of Judgment alone hath He
deceived us? Christ was not on the earth; He promised, He hath performed: no virgin had
conceived; He promised, He hath performed: the precious Blood had not been shed whereby
there should be effaced the handwriting of our death; He promised, He hath performed:
not yet had flesh risen again unto life eternal; He promised, He hath performed: not yet had
the Gentiles believed; He promised, He hath performed: not yet heretics armed with the
name of Christ, against Christ were warring; He foretold, He hath performed: not yet the
idols of the Gentiles from the earth had been effaced; He foretold, He hath performed: when
all these things He hath foretold and performed, concerning the Day of Judgment alone
hath He lied? It will come by all means as these things came; for even these things before
they came to pass were future, and as future were first foretold, and afterwards they came
to pass. It will come, my brethren. Let no one say, it will not come: or, it will come, but far
off is that which will come. But to thyself it is near at hand to go hence.…If thou shalt have
done that which the devil doth suggest, and shalt have despised that which God hath com-
manded; there will come the Judgment Day, and thou wilt find that true which God hath
threatened, and that false which the devil hath promised.…“Remember Thy reproaches,
those which are from the imprudent man all the day long.” For still Christ is reviled: nor
will there be wanting all the day long, that is, even unto the end of time, the vessels of wrath.
Still is it being said, “Vain things the Christians do preach:” still is it being said, “A fond
thing is the resurrection of the dead.” “Remember Thy reproaches.” But what reproaches,
save those “which are from the imprudent man all the day long?” Doth a prudent man say
this? Nay, for a prudent man is said to be one far-seeing. If a prudent man is one far-seeing,
by faith he seeth afar: for with eyes scarce that before the feet is seen.
23. “Forget not the voice of them that implore Thee” (ver. 23). While they groan for
and expect now that which Thou hast promised from the New Testament, and walk by that
same Faith, “do Thou not forget the voice of them imploring Thee.” But those still say,
“Where is Thy God? Let the pride of them that hate Thee come up always to Thee.” Do not
forget even their pride. Nor doth He forget: no doubt He doth either punish or amend.
3390 Exhibuit.
Psalm LXXIV
Psalm LXXV.3391
1. …The Title of this Psalm thus speaketh: “At the end,3392 corrupt not.” What is,
“corrupt not?” That which Thou hast promised, perform. But when? “At the end.” To this
then let the mind’s eye be directed, “unto the end.” Let all the things which have occurred
in the way be passed over, in order that we may attain to the end. Let proud men exult because
of present felicity, let them swell with honours, glitter in gold, overflow with domestics, be
encircled with the services of clients: these things pass away, they pass away like a shadow.
When that end shall have come, when all who now hope in the Lord are to rejoice, then to
them shall come sorrow without end. When the meek shall have received that which the
proud deride, then the vapouring of the proud shall be turned into mourning. Then shall
there be that voice which we know in the Book of Wisdom: for they shall say at that time
when they see the glory of the Saints, who, when they were in humiliation, endured them;
who, when they were exalted, consented not—at that time then they shall say, “These are
they whom sometime we have had in derision.”3393 Where they also say, “What hath pride
profited us, and the boasting of riches hath bestowed upon us what?” All things have passed
away like a shadow. Because on things corruptible they relied, their hope shall be corrupted:
but our own hope at that time shall be substance. For in order that the promise of God may
remain whole and sure and certain towards us, we have said out of a heart3394 of faith, “at
the end corrupt not.” Fear not, therefore, lest any mighty man should corrupt the promises
of God. He doth not corrupt, because He is truthful; He hath no one more mighty by whom
His promise may be corrupted: let us be then sure concerning the promises of God; and let
us sing now from the place where the Psalm beginneth.
2. “We will confess to Thee, O Lord, we will confess to Thee, and will invoke Thy name”
(ver. 1). Do not invoke, before thou confess: confess, and invoke. For Him whom thou art
invoking, unto thyself thou callest. For what is it to invoke, but unto thyself to call? If He is
invoked by thee, that is, if He is called to thee, unto whom doth He draw near? To a proud
man He draweth not near. High indeed He is, one lifted up attaineth not unto Him. In order
that we may reach all exalted objects, we raise ourselves, and if we are not able to reach them,
we look for some appliances or ladders, in order that being exalted we may reach exalted
objects: contrariwise God is both high, and by the lowly He is reached. It is written, “Nigh
is the Lord to them that have bruised the heart.”3395 The bruising of the heart is Godliness,
humility. He that bruiseth himself is angry with himself. Let him make himself angry in

order that he may make Him merciful; let him make himself judge, in order that he may
make Him Advocate. Therefore God doth come when invoked. Unto whom doth He come?
To the proud man He cometh not.…Take heed therefore what ye do: for if He knoweth, He
is not unobservant.3396 It is better therefore that He be unobservant than known. For what
is that same being unobservant, but not knowing? What is, not to know? Not to animadvert.
For even as the act of one avenging animadversion is wont to be spoken of. Here one praying
that He be unobservant: “Turn away Thy face from my sins.”3397 What then wilt thou do
if He shall have turned away His face from thee? A grievous thing it is, and to be feared, lest
He forsake thee. Again, if He turn not away His face, He animadverteth. God knoweth this
thing, God can do this thing, namely, both turn away face from one sinning, and not turn
away from one confessing.…Confess therefore and invoke. For by confessing thou purgest
the Temple, into which He may come, when invoked. Confess and invoke. May He turn
away face from thy sins, not turn away from thee: turn away face from that which thou hast
wrought,3398 not turn away from that which He hath Himself wrought.3399 For thee, as
man, He hath Himself wrought, thy sins thou hast thyself wrought.…
3. But that there is a strengthening of the sense in repetition, by many passages of the
Scriptures we are taught. Thence is that which the Lord saith, “Verily, Verily.”3400 Thence
in certain Psalms is, “So be it, So be it.”3401 To signify the thing, one “So be it” would have
been sufficient: to signify confirmation, there hath been added another “So be it.”…Countless
passages of such sort there are throughout all the Scriptures. With these it is sufficient that
we have commended to your notice a way of speaking which ye may observe in all like cases:
now to the substance attend: “We will confess to Thee,” he saith, “and we will invoke.” I
have said why before invocation confession doth precede: because whom thou dost invoke,
him thou dost invite. But he willeth not to come when invoked, if thou shalt have been lifted
up: lifted up if thou shalt have been, thou wilt not be able to confess. And thou deniest not
any things to God that He knoweth not. Therefore thy confession doth not teach Him, but
it purgeth thee.
4. …Hear ye now the words of Christ. For these seemed not as it were to be His
words,3402 “We will confess to Thee, O God, we will confess to Thee, and will invoke Thy
name.” Now beginneth the discourse in the person of the Head. But whether Head speaketh
3396 Non ignoscit, “doth not forgive” (take no notice).

Psalm LXXV
or whether members speak, Christ speaketh: He speaketh in the person of the Head, He
speaketh in the person of the Body. But what hath been said? There shall be two in one
flesh.3403 “This is a great Sacrament:” “I,” he saith, “speak in Christ and in the Church.”3404
And He Himself in the Gospel, “Therefore no longer two, but one flesh.”3405 For in order
that ye may know these in a manner to be two persons, and again one by the bond of mar-
riage, as one He speaketh in Isaiah, and saith, “As upon a Bridegroom he hath bound upon
me a mitre, and as a Bride he hath clothed me with an ornament.”3406 A Bridegroom He
hath called Himself in the Head, a Bride in the Body. He is speaking therefore as One, let
us hear Him, and in Him let us also speak. Let us be the members of Him, in order that this
voice may possibly be ours also. “I will tell forth,” he saith, “all Thy marvellous things.”
Christ is preaching Himself, He is preaching Himself even in His members now existing,
in order that He may guide unto Him others, and they may draw near that were not, and
may be united with those members of Him, through which members of Him the Gospel
hath been preached; and there may be made one Body under one Head, in one Spirit, in
one Life.
5. And he saith what? “When I shall have received,” he saith, “the time,3407 I will judge
justices” (ver. 2). When shall He judge justices? When He shall have received the time. Not
yet is the precise time. Thanks to His mercy: He first preacheth justices, and then He judgeth
justices. For if He willed to judge before He willed to preach, who would be found that
should be delivered: who would meet Him that should be absolved? Now therefore is the
time of preaching: “I will tell,” he saith, “all Thy marvellous works.” Hear Him telling, hear
Him preaching: for if thou shalt have despised Him, “when I shall have received the time,”
He saith, “I will judge justices.” I forgive, He saith, now sins to one confessing, I will not
spare hereafter one despising.…He hath received a time as Son of Man; He doth govern
times as Son of God. Hear how as Son of Man He hath received the time of judging. He
saith in the Gospel, “He hath given to Him power to execute judgment, because Son of Man
He is.” 3408 According to His nature as Son of God, He hath never received power of judging,
because He never lacked the power of judging: according to His nature as Son of Man He
hath received a time, as of being born, and of suffering, as of dying, and of rising again, and
of ascending, so of coming and of judging. In Him His Body also saith these words, for not
without them He will judge. For He saith in the Gospel, “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones

Psalm LXXV
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”3409 Therefore whole Christ saith, that is, Head and Body
in the Saints, “when I shall have received the time, I will judge justices.”
6. But now what? “The earth hath flowed down” (ver. 3). If the earth hath flowed down,
whence hath it flowed down except by sins? Therefore also they are called delinquencies.
To delinquish is as it were by a kind of liquidity3410 to slip down from the stability of firmness
in virtue and righteousness. For it is through desire of lower things that every man sinneth:
as he is strengthened by the love of higher things, so he falleth down and as it were melteth
away by desire of lower things. This flux of things by the sins of man the merciful forgiver
observing, being a merciful forgiver of sins, not yet an exactor of punishments, He observeth
and saith: The earth herself indeed hath flowed down by them that dwell in her. That which
followeth is an exposition, not an addition. As though thou wert saying, in what manner
hath the earth flowed down? Have the foundations been withdrawn, and hath anything
therein been swallowed up in a sort of gulf? What I mean by earth is all they that dwell
therein. I have found, he saith, the earth sinful. And I have done what? “I have strengthened
the pillars thereof.” What are the pillars which He hath strengthened? Pillars He hath called
the Apostles. So the Apostle Paul concerning his fellow-Apostles saith, “who seemed to be
pillars.”3411 And what would those pillars have been, except by Him they had been
strengthened? For on occasion of a sort of earthquake even these very pillars rocked: at the
Passion of the Lord all the Apostles despaired. Therefore those pillars which rocked at the
Passion of the Lord, by the Resurrection were strengthened. The Beginning of the building
hath cried out through the pillars thereof, and in all those pillars the Architect Himself hath
cried out. For the Apostle Paul was one pillar of them when he said, “Would ye receive a
proof of Him that speaketh in me—Christ?”3412 Therefore, “I,” he saith, “have strengthened
the pillars thereof:” I have risen again, I have shown that death is not to be feared, I have
shown to them that fear, that not even the body itself doth perish in the dying. There terrified
them wounds, there strengthened them scars. The Lord Jesus could have risen again without
any scar: for what great matter were it for that power, to restore the frame of the body to
such perfect soundness, as that no trace at all of past wound should appear? He had power
whence He might make it whole even without scar: but He willed to have that whereby He
might strengthen the rocking pillars.
7. We have heard now, brethren, that which day by day is not kept secret: let us hear
now what He hath cried through these pillars.…He crieth what? “I have said to unjust men,
Do not unjustly” (ver. 4).…But already they have done, and they are guilty: already there

hath flowed down the earth, and all they that dwell therein. Pricked to the heart were they
that crucified Christ,3413 they acknowledged their sin, they learned something of the Apostle,
that they might not despair of the pardon of the Preacher.3414 For as Physician He had
come, and therefore had not come to the whole. “For there is no need,” He saith, “to the
whole of a physician, but to them that are sick. I have not come to call righteous men, but
sinners to repentance.”3415 Therefore, “I have said to unjust men, Do not unjustly.” They
heard not. For of old to us it was spoken: we heard not, we fell, were made mortal, were
begotten mortal: the earth flowed down. Let them hear the Physician even now in order
that they may rise, Him that came to the sick man, Him whom they would not hear when
whole in order that they might not fall, let them hear when lying down in order that they
may rise.…“I have said to unjust men, Do not unjustly; and to the delinquent, Do not exalt
your horn.” There shall be exalted in you the horn of Christ, if your horn be not exalted.
Your horn is of iniquity, the horn of Christ is of majesty.
8. “Be not therefore lifted up: speak not iniquity against God” (ver. 5).…What saith He
in another Psalm? “These things thou hast done,” having enumerated certain sins. “These
things thou hast done,” He saith, “and was silent.”3416 What is, “I was silent”? He is never
silent with commandment, but meanwhile He is silent with punishment: He is keeping still
from vengeance, He doth not pronounce sentence against the condemned. But this man
saith thus, I have done such and such things, and God hath not taken vengeance; behold I
am whole, nought of ill hath befallen me. “These things thou hast done, and I was silent:
thou hast suspected iniquity, that I shall be like unto thee.” What is, “that I shall be like unto
thee”? Because thou art unjust, even Me thou hast deemed unjust; as though an approver
of thy misdeeds, and no adversary, no avenger thereof. And what afterwards saith He to
thee? “I will convict thee, and will set thee before thine own face”?3417 What is this? Because
now by sinning behind thy back thou settest thyself, seest not thyself, examinest not thyself;
I will set thee before thyself, and will bring upon thee punishment from thyself. So also here,
“Speak not iniquity against God.” Attend. Many men speak this iniquity; but dare not openly,
lest as blasphemers they be abhorred by godly men: in their heart they gnaw upon these
things, within they feed upon such impious food; it delighteth them to speak against God,
and if they break not out with tongue, in heart they are not silent. Whence in another Psalm
is said, “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”3418 The fool hath said, but he

hath feared men: he would not say it where men might hear; and he said it in that place
where He might Himself hear concerning whom he said it. Therefore here also in this Psalm
(dearly beloved attend), whereas that which He said, “Do not speak iniquity against God,”
this He saw many men do in heart, He hath also added, “for neither from East, nor from
West, nor from the deserts of the mountains (ver. 6), for God is Judge” (ver. 7). Of thine
iniquities God is Judge. If God He is, everywhere He is present. Whither wilt thou take
thyself away from the eyes of God, so that in some quarter thou mayest speak that which
He may not hear? If from the East God judgeth, withdraw into the West, and say what thou
wilt against God: if from the West, go into the East, and there speak: if from the deserts of
the mountains He judgeth, go into the midst of the peoples, where thou mayest murmur to
thyself. From no place judgeth He that everywhere is secret, everywhere open; whom it is
allowed no one to know as He is, and whom no one is permitted not to know. Take heed
what thou doest. Thou art speaking iniquity against God. “The Spirit of the Lord hath filled
the round world” (another Scripture saith this), “and that which containeth all things hath
knowledge of the voice: wherefore he that speaketh unjust things cannot be hid.”3419 Do
not therefore think God to be in places: He is with thee such an one as thou shalt have been.
What is such an one as thou shalt have been? Good, if thou shalt have been good; and evil
to thee He will seem, if evil thou shalt have been; but a Helper, if good thou shalt have been;
an Avenger, if evil thou shalt have been. There thou hast a Judge in thy secret place. Willing
to do something of evil, from the public thou retirest into thy house, where no enemy may
see; from those places of thine house which are open and before the eyes of men, thou re-
movest thyself into a chamber; thou fearest even in thy chamber some witness from some
other quarter, thou retirest into thy heart, there thou meditatest: He is more inward than
thy heart. Whithersoever therefore thou shalt have fled, there He is. From thyself whither
wilt thou flee? Wilt thou not follow thyself whithersoever thou shalt flee? But since there is
One more inward even than thyself, there is no place whither thou mayest flee from God
angry, but to God reconciled. There is no place at all whither thou mayest flee. Wilt thou
flee from Him? Flee to Him.…What then shall we do now? “Let us come before His face,”
ἐν ἐξομολογήσει, come before in confession: He shall come gentle whom thou hadst made
angry. “Neither from the deserts of the mountains, for God is Judge:” not from the East, not
from the West, not from the deserts of the mountains. Wherefore? “For God is Judge.” If
in any place He were, He would not be God: but because God is Judge, not man, do not expect
Him out of places. His place thou wilt be, if thou art good, if after having confessed3420 thou
shalt have invoked Him.

9. “One He humbleth, and another He exalteth” (ver. 7). Whom humbleth, whom exalteth
this Judge? Observe these two men in the temple, and ye see whom He humbleth and whom
He exalteth. “They went up into the Temple to pray,” He saith, “the one a Pharisee, and the
other a Publican.…“Verily I say unto you, that Publican went down justified more than that
Pharisee: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted.”3421 Thus hath been explained a verse of this Psalm. God the Judge doth
what? “One He humbleth, and another He exalteth:” He humbleth the proud, He exalteth
the humble.
10. “For the cup in the hand of the Lord of pure wine is full of mixed” (ver. 8). Justly
so. “And He hath poured out of this upon this man; nevertheless, the dreg thereof hath not
been emptied; there shall drink all the sinners of earth.” Let us be somewhat recruited; there
is here some obscurity.…The first question that meeteth us is this, “of pure wine it is full of
mixed.” How “of pure,” if “of mixed”? But when he saith, “the cup in the hand of the Lord”
(to men instructed in the Church of Christ I am speaking), ye ought not indeed to paint in
your heart God as it were circumscribed with a human form, lest, though the temples are
shut up, ye forge images in your hearts. This cup therefore doth signify something. We will
find out this. But “in the hand of the Lord,” is, in the power of the Lord. For the hand of
God is spoken of for the power of God. For even in reference to men ofttimes is said, in
hand he hath it: that is, in his power he hath it, when he chooseth he doth it. “Of pure wine
it is full of mixed.” In continuation he hath himself explained: “He hath inclined,” he saith,
“from this unto this man; nevertheless the dreg thereof hath not been emptied.” Behold how
it was full of mixed wine. Let it not therefore terrify you that it is both pure and mixed: pure
because of the genuineness thereof, mixed because of the dreg. What then in that place is
the wine, and what the dreg? And what is, “He hath inclined from this unto this man,” in
such sort that the dreg thereof was not emptied?
11. Call ye to mind from whence he came to this: “one He humbleth, and another He
exalteth.”3422 That which was figured to us in the Gospel through two men, a Pharisee and
a Publican,3423 this let us, taking in a wider sense, understand of two peoples, of Jews and
of Gentiles: the people of the Jews that Pharisee was, the people of the Gentiles that Public-
an.…As those by being proud have withdrawn, so these by confessing have drawn near.
The cup therefore full of pure wine in the hand of the Lord, as far as the Lord giveth me to
understand,3424…the cup of pure wine full of the mixed, seemeth to me to be the Law, which

was given to the Jews, and all that Scripture of the Old Testament, as it is called; there are
the weights of all manner of sentences. For therein the New Testament lieth concealed, as
though in the dreg of corporal Sacraments. The circumcision of the flesh is a thing of great
mystery,3425 and there is understood from thence the circumcision of the heart. The Temple
of Jerusalem is a thing of great mystery, and there is understood from it the Body of the
Lord. The land of promise3426 is understood to be the Kingdom of Heaven. The sacrifice
of victims and of beasts hath a great mystery: but in all those kinds of sacrifices is understood
that one Sacrifice and only victim of the Cross, the Lord, instead of all which sacrifices we
have one; because even those figured these, that is, with those these were figured. That people
received the Law, they received commandments just and good.3427 What is so just as, thou
shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not speak false
testimony, honour thy father and mother, thou shalt not covet the property of thy neighbour,
one God thou shalt adore, and Him alone thou shalt serve,3428 all these things belong to the
wine. But those things carnal have as it were sunk down in order that they might remain
with them, and there might be poured forth from thence all the spiritual understanding.
But “the cup in the hand of the Lord,” that is, in the power of the Lord: “of pure wine,” that
is, of the mere Law: “is full of mixed,” that is, is together with the dreg of corporal Sacraments.
And because the one He humbleth, the proud Jew, and the other He exalteth, the confessing
Gentile; “He hath inclined from this unto this,” that is, from the Jewish people unto the
Gentile people. Hath inclined what? The Law. There hath distilled from thence a spiritual
sense. “Nevertheless, the dreg thereof hath not been emptied,” for all the carnal Sacraments
have remained with the Jews. “There shall drink all the sinners of the earth.” Who shall
drink? “All the sinners of the earth.” Who are the sinners of the earth? The Jews were indeed
sinners, but proud: again, the Gentiles were sinners, but humble. All sinners shall drink,
but see, who the dreg, who the wine. For those by drinking the dreg have come to nought:
these by drinking the wine have been justified. I would dare to speak of them even as inebri-
ated, and I shall not fear: and O that all ye were thus inebriated. Call to mind, “Thy cup in-
ebriating, how passing beautiful!”3429 But why? Do ye think, my brethren, that all those
who by confessing Christ even willed to die, were sober? So drunk they were, that they knew
with the rule of faith: we neither envy our elders, nor, little as we are, do we despair. What seemeth good to us

not their friends. All their kindred, who strove to divert them from the hope of Heavenly
rewards by earthly allurements, were not acknowledged, were not heard by them drunken.
Were they not drunken, whose heart had been changed? Were they not drunken, whose
mind had been alienated from this world? “There shall drink,” he saith, “all the sinners of
the earth.” But who shall drink the wine? Sinners shall drink, but in order that they may not
remain sinners; in order that they may be justified, in order that they may not be punished.

is said, “corrupt not.”3430 “And all the horns of sinners I will break, and there shall be exalted
the horns of the Just” (ver. 10). This is, the one He humbleth, the other He exalteth. Sinners
would not have their horns to be broken, which without doubt will be broken at the end.
Thou wilt not have Him then break them, do thou to-day break them. For thou hast heard
above, do not despise it: “I have said to unjust men, Do not unjustly, and to the delinquents,
Do not exalt the horn.”3431 When thou hast heard, do not exalt the horn, thou hast despised
and hast exalted the horn: thou shalt come to the end, where there shall come to pass, “All
the horns of sinners I will break, and there shall be exalted the horns of the Just.” The horns
of sinners are the dignities of proud men: the horns of the Just are the gifts of Christ. For
by horns exultations are understood. Thou hatest on earth earthly exultation, in order that
thou mayest have the heavenly. Thou lovest the earthly, He doth not admit thee to the
Heavenly: and unto confusion will belong thy horn which is broken, just as unto glory it
will belong, if thy horn is exalted. Now therefore there is time for making choice, then there
will not be. Thou wilt not say, I will be let go and will make choice. For there have preceded
the words, “I have said to the unjust.” If I have not said, make ready an excuse, make ready
a defence: but if I have said, seize first upon confession, lest thou come unto damnation; for
then confession will be too late, and there will be no defence.

Psalm LXXV
Psalm LXXVI.3432
1. The Jews are wont to glory in this Psalm which we have sung, saying, “Known in
Judæa is God, in Israel great is the name of Him:” and to revile the Gentiles to whom God
is not known, and to say that to themselves alone God is known; seeing that the Prophet
saith, “Known in Judæa is God.” In other places therefore He is unknown. But God is known
in very deed in Judæa, if they understand what is Judæa. For indeed God is not known except
in Judæa. Behold even we say this, that except a person shall have been in Judæa, known to
him God cannot be. But what saith the Apostle? He that in secret is a Jew, he that is so in
circumcision of the heart, not in letter but in spirit.3433 There are therefore Jews in circum-
cision of the flesh, and there are Jews in circumcision of the heart. Many of our holy fath-
ers3434 had both the circumcision of the flesh, for a seal of the faith, and circumcision of
the heart, for the faith itself. From these fathers these men degenerating, who now in the
name do glory, and have lost their deeds; from these fathers, I say, degenerating, they have
remained Jews in flesh, in heart Heathens. For these are Jews, who are out of Abraham, from
whom Isaac was born, and out of him Jacob, and out of Jacob the twelve Patriarchs, and out
of the twelve Patriarchs the whole people of the Jews.3435 But they were generally called
Jews for this reason, that Judah was one of the twelve sons of Jacob, a Patriarch among the
twelve, and from his stock the Royalty came among the Jews. For all this people after the
number of the twelve sons of Jacob, had twelve tribes. What we call tribes are as it were
distinct houses and congregations of people. That people, I say, had twelve tribes, out of
which twelve tribes one tribe was Judah, out of which were the kings; and there was another
tribe, Levi, out of which were the priests. But because to the priests serving the temple no
land was allotted,3436 but it was necessary that among twelve tribes all the Land of promise
should be shared: there having been therefore taken out one tribe of higher dignity, the tribe
of Levi, which was of the priests, there would have remained eleven, unless by the adoption
of the two sons of Joseph the number twelve were completed.
What this is, observe. One of the twelve sons of Jacob was Joseph.…This Joseph had
two sons, Ephraim and Manasse. Jacob, dying, as though by will, received those his grandsons
into the number of sons, and said to his son Joseph, “The rest that are born shall be to thee;
but these to me, and they shall divide the land with their brethren.”3437 As yet there had

vows.

Psalm LXXVI
not been given nor divided the land of promise, but he was speaking in the Spirit, prophesy-
ing. The two sons therefore of Joseph being added, there were made up nevertheless twelve
tribes, since now there are thirteen. For instead of one tribe of Joseph, two were added, and
there were made thirteen. There being taken out then the tribe of Levi, that tribe of priests
which did serve the Temple, and lived by the tithes of all the rest unto whom the land was
divided, there remain twelve. In these twelve was the tribe of Judah, whence the kings were.
For at first from another tribe was given King Saul,3438 and he was rejected as being an evil
king; after there was given from the tribe of Judah King David, and out of him from the
tribe of Judah were the Kings.3439 But Jacob had spoken of this, when he blessed his sons,
“there shall not fail a prince out of Judah, nor a leader from his thighs, until there come He
to whom the promise hath been made.”3440 But from the tribe of Judah there came Our
Lord Jesus Christ. For He is, as the Scripture saith, and as ye have but now heard, out of the
seed of David born of Mary.3441 But as regardeth the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ,
wherein He is equal with the Father, He is not only before the Jews, but also before Abraham
himself;3442 nor only before Abraham, but also before Adam; nor only before Adam, but
also before Heaven and earth and before ages: for all things by Himself were made, and
without Him there was made nothing.3443 Because therefore in prophecy hath been said,
“there shall not fail a prince out of Judah,” etc.:3444 former times are examined, and we find
that the Jews always had their kings of the tribe of Judah, and had no foreign king before
that Herod who was king when the Lord was born. Thence began foreign kings, from
Herod.3445 Before Herod all were of the tribe of Judah, but only until there should come
He to whom the promise had been made. Therefore when the Lord Himself came, the
kingdom of the Jews was overthrown, and removed from the Jews. Now they have no king;
because they will not acknowledge the true King. See now whether they must be called Jews.
Now ye do see that they must not be called Jews. They have themselves with their own voice
resigned that name, so that they are not worthy to be called Jews, except only in the flesh.
When did they sever themselves from the name? They said, “We have no king but Cæsar.”3446
O ye who are called Jews and are not, if ye have no king but Cæsar, there hath failed a Prince

of Judah: there hath come then He to whom the promise hath been made. They then are
more truly Jews, who have been made Christians out of Jews: the rest of the Jews, who in
Christ have not believed, have deserved to lose even the very name. The true Judæa, then,
is the Church of Christ, believing in that King, who hath come out of the tribe of Judah
through the Virgin Mary; believing in Him of whom the Apostle was just now speaking, in
writing to Timothy, “Be thou mindful that Jesus Christ hath risen from the dead, of the seed
of David, after my Gospel.”3447 For of Judah is David, and out of David is the Lord Jesus
Christ. We believing in Christ do belong to Judah: and we acknowledge Christ. We, that
with eyes have not seen, in faith do keep Him. Let not therefore the Jews revile, who are no
longer Jews. They said themselves, “We have no king but Cæsar.”3448 For better were it for
them that their king should be Christ, of the seed of David, of the tribe of Judah. Nevertheless
because Christ Himself is of the seed of David after the flesh, but God above all things blessed
for ever,3449 He is Himself our King and our God; our King, inasmuch as born of the tribe
of Judah, after the flesh, was Christ the Lord, the Saviour; but our God, who is before Judah,
and before Heaven and earth, by whom were made all things,3450 both spiritual and corporal.
For if all things by Himself were made; even Mary herself, out of whom He was born, by
Himself was made.…
2. “Known in Judæa is God, in Israel great is the Name of Him” (ver. 1). Concerning
Israel also we ought so to take it as we have concerning Judæa: as they were not the true
Jews, so neither was that the true Israel. For what is Israel said to be? One seeing God. And
how have they seen God, among whom He walked in the flesh; and while they supposed
Him to be man, they slew Him?…“In Israel great is His Name.” Wilt thou be Israel? Observe
that man concerning whom the Lord saith, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom guile is
not.” 3451 If a true Israelite is he in whom guile is not, the guileful and lying are not true Is-
raelites. Let them not say then, that with them is God, and great is His name in Israel. Let
them prove themselves Israelites, and I grant that “in Israel great is His Name.”
3. “And there hath been made in peace a place for Him, and His habitation is in Sion”
(ver. 2). Again, Sion is as it were the country of the Jews; the true Sion is the Church of
Christians. But the interpretation of the Hebrew names is thus handed down to us: Judæa
is interpreted confession, Israel, one seeing God. After Judæa is Israel. Wilt thou see God?
First do thou confess, and then in thyself there is made a place for God; because “there hath
been made in peace a place for Him.” So long as then thou confessest not thy sins, in a

Psalm LXXVI
manner thou art quarrelling with God. For how art thou not disputing with Him, who art
praising that which displeaseth Him? He punisheth a thief, thou dost praise theft: He doth
punish a drunken man, thou dost praise drunkenness. Thou art disputing with God, thou
hast not made for Him a place in thy heart: because in peace is His place. And how dost
thou begin to have peace with God? Thou beginnest with Him in confession. There is a
voice of a Psalm, saying, “Begin ye to the Lord in confession.”3452 What is, “Begin ye to the
Lord in confession”? Begin ye to be joined to the Lord. In what manner? So that the same
thing may displease you as displeaseth Him. There displeaseth Him thy evil life; if it please
thyself, thou art disunited from Him; if it displease thee, through confession to Him thou
art united.…
4. “There He hath broken the strength of bows, and the shield, and the sword, and the
battle” (ver. 3). Where hath He broken? In that eternal peace, in that perfect peace. And
now, my brethren, they that have rightly believed see that they ought not to rely on them-
selves: and all the might of their own menaces, and whatsoever is in them whetted for mis-
chief, this they break in pieces; and whatsoever they deem of great virtue wherewith to
protect themselves temporally, and the war which they were waging against God by defending
their sins, all these things He hath broken there.
5. “Thou enlightening marvellously from the eternal mountains” (ver. 4). What are the
eternal mountains? Those which He hath Himself made eternal; which are the great
mountains, the preachers of truth. Thou dost enlighten, but from the eternal mountains:
the great mountains are first to receive Thy light, and from Thy light which the mountains
receive, the earth also is clothed. But those great mountains the Apostles have received, the
Apostles have received as it were the first streaks of the rising light.…Wherefore also, in
another place, a Psalm saith what? “I have lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains, whence
there shall come help to me.”3453 What then, in the mountains is thy hope, and from thence
to thee shall there come help? Hast thou stayed at the mountains? Take heed what thou
doest. There is something above the mountains: above the mountains is He at whom the
mountains tremble. “I have lifted up,” he saith, “mine eyes unto the mountains, whence
there shall come help to me.” But what followeth? “My help,” he saith, “is from the Lord,
who hath made Heaven and earth.” 3454 Unto the mountains indeed I have lifted up eyes,
because through the mountains to me the Scriptures were displayed: but I have my heart in
Him that doth enlighten all mountains.…
6. “There have been troubled all the unwise in heart” (ver. 5).…How have they been
troubled? When the Gospel is preached. And what is life eternal? And who is He that hath

3453 Ps. cxxi. 1.

Psalm LXXVI
risen from the dead? The Athenians wondered, when the Apostle Paul spake of the resurrec-
tion of the dead, and thought that he spake but fables.3455 But because he said that there
was another life which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it gone up into the
heart of man,3456 therefore the unwise in heart were troubled. But what hath befallen them?
“They have slept their sleep, and all men of riches have found nothing in their hands.” They
have loved things present, and have gone to sleep in the midst of things present: and so these
very present things have become to them delightful: just as he that seeth in a dream himself
to have found treasure, is so long rich as he waketh not. The dream hath made him rich,
waking hath made him poor. Sleep perchance hath held him slumbering on the earth, and
lying on the hard ground, poor and perchance a beggar; in sleep he hath seen himself to lie
on an ivory or golden bed, and on feathers heaped up; so long as he is sleeping, he is sleeping
well, waking he hath found himself on the hard ground, whereon sleep had taken him. Such
men also are these too: they have come into this life, and through temporal desires, they
have as it were slumbered here; and them riches, and vain pomps that fly away, have taken,
and they have passed away: they have not understood how much of good might be done
therewith. For if they had known of another life, there they would have laid up unto them-
selves the treasure which here was doomed to perish: like as Zacchæus, the chief of the
Publicans, saw that good3457 when he received the Lord Jesus in his house, and he saith,
“The half of my goods I give to the poor, and if to any man I have done any wrong, fourfold
I restore.”3458 This man was not in the emptiness of men dreaming, but in the faith of men
awake.…
7. “By Thy chiding, O God of Jacob, there have slept all men that have mounted horses”
(ver. 6). Who are they that have mounted horses? They that would not be humble. To sit
on horseback is no sin; but it is a sin to lift up the neck of power against God, and to deem
one’s self to be in some distinction. Because thou art rich, thou hast mounted; God doth
chide, and thou sleepest. Great is the anger of Him chiding, great the anger. Let your Love
observe the terrible thing. Chiding hath noise, the noise is wont to make men wake. So great
is the force of God chiding, that he said, “By Thy chiding, O God of Jacob, there have slept
all men that have mounted horses.” Behold what a sleep that Pharaoh slept who mounted
horses. For he was not awake in heart, because against chiding he had his heart hardened.3459
For hardness of heart is slumber. I ask you, my brethren, how they sleep, who, while the
Gospel is sounding, and the Amen, and the Hallelujah, throughout the whole world, yet

Psalm LXXVI
will not condemn their old life, and wake up unto a new life. There was the Scripture of God
in Judæa only, now throughout the whole world it is sung. In that one nation one God who
made all things was spoken of, as to be adored and worshipped; now where is He unsaid?
Christ hath risen again, though derided on the Cross; that very Cross whereon He was de-
rided, He hath now imprinted on the brows of kings: and men yet sleep.…
8. “Thou art terrible, and who shall withstand Thee at that time by Thine anger?” (ver.
7). Now they sleep, and perceive not Thee angry; but for cause that they should sleep, He
was angry. Now that which sleeping they perceived not, at the end they shall perceive. For
there shall appear the Judge of quick and dead. “And who shall withstand Thee at that time
by Thine anger?” For now they speak that which they will, and they dispute against God
and say, who are the Christians? or who is Christ? or what fools are they that believe that
which they see not, and relinquish the pleasures which they see, and follow the faith of things
which are not displayed to their eyes! Ye sleep and snore,3460 ye speak against God, as much
as ye are able. “How long shall sinners, O Lord, how long shall sinners glory, they answer
and will speak iniquity?”3461 But when doth no one answer and no one speak, except when
he turneth himself3462 against himself?…
9. “From Heaven Thou hast hurled judgment: the earth hath trembled, and hath rested”
(ver. 8). She which now doth trouble herself, she which now speaketh, hath to fear at the
end and to rest. Better had she now rested, that at the end she might have rejoiced. Rested?
When? “When God arose unto judgment, that He might save all the meek in heart” (ver.
9). Who are the meek in heart? They that on snorting horses have not mounted, but in their
humility have confessed their own sins. “For the thought of a man shall confess to Thee,
and the remnants of the thought shall celebrate solemnities to Thee” (ver. 10). The first is
the thought, the latter are the remnants of the thought. What is the first thought? That from
whence we begin, that good thought whence thou wilt begin to confess. Confession uniteth
us to Christ. But now the confession itself, that is, the first thought, doth produce in us the
remnants of the thought: and those very “remnants of thought shall celebrate solemnities
to Thee.” What is the thought which shall confess? That which condemneth the former life,
that whereunto that which it was is displeasing, in order that it may be that which it was
not, is itself the first thought. But because thus thou oughtest to withdraw from sins, with
the first thought after having confessed to God, that it may not escape thy memory that thou
hast been a sinner; in that thou hast been a sinner, thou dost celebrate solemnities to God.
Furthermore it is to be understood as followeth. The first thought hath confession, and de-
parture from the old life. But if thou shalt have forgotten from what sins thou hast been
3460 Balatis.
3461 Ps. xciv. 3.
3462 Oxf. mss. “they,” “themselves.”
Psalm LXXVI
delivered, thou dost not render thanks to the Deliverer, and dost not celebrate solemnities
to thy God. Behold the first confessing thought of Saul the Apostle, now Paul, who at first
was Saul, when he heard a voice from Heaven!…He put forth the first thought of obedience:
when he heard, “I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest,” “O Lord,” he saith, “what
dost Thou bid me to do?”3463 This is a thought confessing: now he is calling upon the Lord,
whom he persecuted. In what manner the remnants of the thought shall celebrate solemnities,
in the case of Paul ye have heard, when the Apostle himself was being read: “Be thou
mindful that Christ Jesus hath risen from the dead, of the seed of David, after my Gospel.”3464
What is, be thou mindful? Though effaced from thy memory be the thought, whereby at
first thou hast confessed: be the remnant of the thought in the memory.…
10. Even once was Christ sacrificed for3465 us, when we believed; then was thought; but
now there are the remnants of thought, when we remember Who hath come to us, and what
He hath forgiven us; by means of those very remnants of thought, that is, by means of the
memory herself, He is daily so sacrificed for us,3466 as if He were daily renewing us, that
hath renewed us by His first grace. For now the Lord hath renewed us in Baptism, and we
have become new men, in hope indeed rejoicing, in order that in tribulation we may be
patient:3467 nevertheless, there ought not to escape from our memory that which hath been
bestowed upon us. And if now thy thought is not what it was,—for the first thought was to
depart from sin: but now thou dost not depart, but at that time didst depart,—be there
remnants of thought, lest He who hath made whole escape from memory.…
11. “Vow ye, and pay to the Lord our God” (ver. 11). Let each man vow what he is able,
and pay it. Do not vow and not pay: but let every man vow, and pay what he can. Be ye not
slow to vow: for ye will accomplish the vows by powers not your own. Ye will fail, if on
yourselves ye rely: but if on Him to whom ye vow ye rely, ye will be safe to pay. “Vow ye,
and pay to the Lord our God.” What ought we all in common to vow? To believe in Him,
to hope from Him for life eternal, to live godly according to a measure common to all. For
there is a certain measure common to all men. To commit no theft is not a thing enjoined
merely upon one devoted to continence,3468 and not enjoined upon the married woman:
to commit no adultery is enjoined upon all men: not to love wine-bibbing, whereby the soul
is swallowed up, and doth corrupt in herself the Temple of God, is enjoined to all alike: not
to be proud, is enjoined to all men alike: not to slay man, not to hate a brother, not to lay a

Psalm LXXVI
plot to destroy any one, is enjoined to all in common. The whole of this we all ought to vow.
There are also vows proper for individuals: one voweth to God conjugal chastity, that he
will know no other woman besides his wife:3469 so also the woman, that she will know no
other man besides her husband. Other men also vow, even though they have used such a
marriage, that beyond this they will have no such thing, that they will neither desire nor
admit the like: and these men have vowed a greater vow than the former. Others vow even
virginity from the beginning of life, that they will even know no such thing as those who
having experienced have relinquished: and these men have vowed the greatest vow. Others
vow that their house shall be a place of entertainment for all the Saints that may come: a
great vow they vow. Another voweth to relinquish all his goods to be distributed to the poor,
and go into a community, into a society of the Saints: a great vow he doth vow. “Vow ye,
and pay to the Lord our God.” Let each one vow what he shall have willed to vow; let him
give heed to this, that he pay what he hath vowed. If any man doth look back with regard
to what he hath vowed to God, it is an evil. Some woman or other devoted to continence
hath willed to marry: what hath she willed? The same as any virgin. What hath she willed?
The same as her own mother. Hath she willed any evil thing? Evil certainly. Why? Because
already she had vowed to the Lord her God. For what hath the apostle Paul said concerning
such? Though he saith that young widows may marry if they will:3470 nevertheless he saith
in a certain passage, “but more blessed she will be, if so she shall have remained, after my
judgment.”3471 He showeth that she is more blessed, if so she shall have remained; but
nevertheless that she is not to be condemned, if she shall have willed to marry. But what
saith he concerning certain who have vowed and have not paid? “Having,” he saith, “judg-
ment, because the first faith they have made void.”3472 What is, “the first faith they have
made void”? They have vowed, and have not paid. Let no brother therefore, when placed
in a monastery, say, I shall depart from the monastery: for neither are they only that are in
a monastery to attain unto the kingdom of Heaven, nor do those that are not there not belong
unto God. We answer him, but they have not vowed; thou hast vowed, thou hast looked
back. When the Lord was threatening them with the day of judgment, He saith what? “Re-
member Lot’s wife.”3473 To all men He spake. For what did Lot’s wife? She was delivered
from Sodom, and being in the way she looked back. In the place where she looked back,
there she remained. For she became a statue of salt,3474 in order that by considering her
3469 The wife being living, and supposing he may survive. The following case would be that of one already
a widower.

Psalm LXXVI
men might be seasoned, might have sense, might not be infatuated, might not look back,
lest by giving a bad example they should themselves remain and season others. For even
now we are saying this to certain of our brethren, whom perchance we may have seen as it
were weak in the good they have purposed. And wilt thou be such an one as he was? We
put before them certain who have looked back. They are savourless 3475 in themselves, but
they season others, inasmuch as they are mentioned, in order that fearing their example
they may not look back. “Vow ye, and pay.” For that wife of Lot to all doth belong. A married
woman hath had the will to commit adultery; from her place whither she had arrived she
looked back. A widow who had vowed so to remain hath willed to marry, she hath willed
the thing which was lawful to her who hath married, but to herself was not lawful, because
from her place she hath looked back. There is a virgin devoted to continence, already dedic-
ated to God; let her have3476 also the other gifts which truly do adorn virginity itself, and
without which that virginity is unclean. For what if she be uncorrupt in body and corrupt
in mind? What is it that he hath said? What if no one hath touched the body, but if perchance
she be drunken, be proud, be contentious, be talkative? All these things God doth condemn.
If before she had vowed, she had married, she would not have been condemned: she hath
chosen something better, hath overcome that which was lawful for her; she is proud, and
doth commit so many things unlawful. This I say, it is lawful for her to marry before that
she voweth, to be proud is never lawful. O thou virgin of God, thou hast willed not to marry,
which is lawful: thou dost exalt thyself, which is not lawful. Better is a virgin humble, than
a married woman humble: but better is a married woman humble, than a virgin proud. But
she that looked back upon marriage is condemned, not because she hath willed to marry;
but because she had already gone before, and is become the wife of Lot by looking back. Be
ye not slow, that are able, whom God doth inspire to seize upon higher callings: for we do
not say these things in order that ye may not vow, but in order that ye may vow and may
pay. Now because we have treated of these matters, thou perchance wast willing to vow, and
now art not willing to vow. But observe what the Psalm hath said to thee. It hath not said,
“Vow not;” but, “Vow and pay.” Because thou hast heard, “pay,” wilt thou not vow? Therefore
wast thou willing to vow, and not to pay? Nay, do both. One thing is done by thy profession,
another thing will be perfected by the aid of God. Look to Him who doth guide thee, and
thou wilt not look back to the place whence He is leading thee forth. He that guideth thee
is walking before thee; the place from whence He is guiding thee is behind thee. Love Him
guiding, and He doth not condemn thee looking back. 3477

Psalm LXXVI
12. “All they that are in the circuit of Him shall offer gifts.” Who are in the circuit of
Him?…Whatever is common to all is in the midst. Why is it said to be in the midst? Because
it is at the same distance from all, and at the same proximity to all. That which is not in the
middle, is as it were private. That which is public is set in the middle, in order that all they
that come may use the same, may be enlightened. Let no one say, it is mine: lest he should
be wanting to make his own share of that which is in the midst for all. What then is, “All
they that are in the circuit of Him shall offer gifts”? All they that understand truth to be
common to all, and who do not make it as it were their own by being proud concerning it,
they shall offer gifts; because they have humility: but they that make as it were their own
that which is common to all, as though it were set in the middle, are endeavouring to lead
men astray to a party, these shall not offer gifts.…“To Him terrible.” Let therefore all men
fear that are in the circuit of Him. For therefore they shall fear, and with trembling they
shall praise; because they are in the circuit of Him, to the end that all men may attain unto
Him, and He may openly meet all, and openly enlighten all. This is, to stand in awe with
others.3478 When thou hast made him as it were thine own, and no longer common, thou
art exalted unto pride; though it is written, “Serve ye the Lord in fear, and exult unto Him
with trembling.”3479 Therefore they shall offer gifts, who are in the circuit of Him. For they
are humble who know truth to be common to all.
13. To whom shall they offer gifts? “To Him terrible, and to Him that taketh away the
spirit of princes” (ver. 12). For the spirits of princes are proud spirits. They then are not His
Spirits; for if they know anything, their own they will it to be, not public; but, that which
setteth Himself forth as equal toward all men, that setteth Himself in the midst, in order
that all men may take as much as they can, whatever they can; not of what is any man’s, but
of what is God’s, and therefore of their own because they have become His. Therefore they
must needs be humble: they have lost their own spirit, and they have the Spirit of God.…For
if thou shalt have confessed thyself dust, God out of dust doth make3480 man. All they that
are in the circuit of Him do offer gifts. All humble men do confess to Him, and do adore
Him. “To Him terrible they offer gifts.” Whence to Him terrible exult ye with trembling:3481
“and to Him that taketh away the spirit of princes:” that is, that taketh away the haughtiness
of proud men. “To Him terrible among the kings of the earth.” Terrible are the kings of the
earth, but He is above all, that doth terrify the kings of the earth. Be thou a king of the earth,
and God will be to thee terrible. How, wilt thou say, shall I be a king of the earth? Rule the
earth, and thou wilt be a king of the earth. Do not therefore with desire of empire set before

thou the earth which thou bearest. Hear the Apostle ruling the earth: “I do not so fight as

to other men, I myself become a reprobate.”3482…

Psalm LXXVII.3483
1. This Psalm’s lintel is thus inscribed: “Unto the end, for Idithun, a Psalm to Asaph
himself.” What “Unto the end” is, ye know. Idithun is interpreted “leaping over those men,”
Asaph is interpreted “a congregation.” Here therefore there is speaking “a congregation that
leapeth over,” in order that it may reach the End, which is Christ Jesus.3484…
2. “With my voice,” he saith, “to the Lord I have cried” (ver. 1). But many men cry unto
the Lord for the sake of getting riches and avoiding losses, for the safety of their friends, for
the security of their house, for temporal felicity, for secular dignity, lastly, even for mere
soundness of body, which is the inheritance3485 of the poor man. For such and such like
things many men do cry unto the Lord; scarce one for the sake of the Lord Himself. For an
easy thing it is for a man to desire anything of the Lord, and not to desire the Lord Himself;
as if forsooth that which He giveth could be sweeter than Himself that giveth. Whosoever
therefore doth cry unto the Lord for the sake of any other thing, is not yet one that leapeth
over.…He doth indeed hearken to thee at the time when thou dost seek Himself, not when
through Himself thou dost seek any other thing. It hath been said of some men, “They cried,
and there was no one to save them; to the Lord, and He hearkened not unto them.”3486 For
why? Because the voice of them was not unto the Lord. This the Scripture doth express in
another place, where it saith of such men, “On the Lord they have not called.”3487 Unto
Him they have not ceased to cry, and yet upon the Lord they have not called. What is, upon
the Lord they have not called? They have not called the Lord unto themselves:3488 they have
not invited the Lord to their heart, they would not have themselves inhabited by the Lord.
And therefore what hath befallen them? “They have trembled with fear where fear was not.”
They have trembled about the loss of things present, for the reason that they were not full
of Him, upon whom they have not called. They have not loved gratis, so that after the loss
of temporal things they could say, “As it hath pleased the Lord, so hath been done, be the
name of the Lord blessed.”3489 Therefore this man saith, “My voice is unto the Lord, and
He doth hearken unto me.” Let him show us how this cometh to pass.
3. “In the day of tribulation I have sought out God” (ver. 2). Who art thou that doest
this thing? In the day of thy tribulation take heed what thou seekest out. If a jail be the cause
of tribulation, thou seekest to get forth from jail: if fever be the cause of tribulation, thou

seekest health: if hunger be the cause of tribulation, thou seekest fulness: if losses be the
cause of tribulation, thou seekest gain: if expatriation be the cause of tribulation, thou seekest
the home of thy flesh. And why should I name all things, or when could I name all things?
Dost thou wish to be one leaping over? In the day of thy tribulation seek out God: not
through God some other thing, but out of tribulation God, that to this end God may take
away tribulation, that thou mayest without anxiety cleave unto God. “In the day of my
tribulation, I have sought out God:” not any other thing, but “God I have sought out.” And
how hast thou sought out? “With my hands in the night before Him.”…
4. Tribulation must not be thought to be this or that in particular. For every individual
that doth not yet leap over, thinketh that as yet to be no tribulation, unless it be a thing
which may have befallen this life of some sad occasion: but this man, that leapeth over, doth
count this whole life to be his tribulation. For so much doth he love his supernal country,
that the earthly pilgrimage is of itself the greatest tribulation. For how can this life be other-
wise than a tribulation, I pray you? how can that not be a tribulation, the whole whereof
hath been called temptation?3490 Thou hast it written in the book of Job,3491 is not human
life a temptation upon earth? Hath he said, human life is tempted upon earth? Nay, but life
itself is a temptation. If therefore temptation, it must surely be a tribulation. In this tribulation
therefore, that is to say in this life, this man that leapeth over hath sought out God. How?
“With my hands,” he saith. What is, “with my hands”? With my works. For he was not
seeking any thing corporeal, so that he might find and handle something which he had lost,
so that he might seek with hands coin, gold, silver, vesture, in short everything which can
be held in the hands. Howbeit, even our Lord Jesus Christ Himself willed Himself to be
sought after with hands, when to His doubting disciple He showed the scars.3492…What
then, to us belongeth not the seeking with hands? It belongeth to us, as I have said, to seek
with works. When so? “In the night.” What is, “in the night”? In this age. For it is night
until there shine forth day in the glorified advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. For would ye see
how it is night? Unless we had here had a lantern, we should have remained in darkness.
For Peter saith,“ We too have more sure the prophetic discourse, whereunto ye do well to
give heed, as to a lantern shining in a dark place, until day shine, and the day-star arise in
your hearts.”3493 There is therefore to come day after this night, meanwhile in this night a
lantern is not lacking. And this is perchance what we are now doing: by explaining these
passages, we are bringing in a lantern, in order that we may rejoice in this night. Which in-
deed ought alway to be burning in your houses. For to such men is said, “The Spirit quench
3490 Or, “trial.”
3491 Job vii. 1.
3492 John xx. 27.
3493 2 Pet. i. 19.
Psalm LXXVII
ye not.”3494 And as though explaining what he was saying, he continueth and saith,
“Prophecy despise ye not:” that is, let the lantern alway shine in you. And even this light by
comparison with a sort of ineffable day is called night. For the very life of believers by
comparison with the life of unbelievers is day.…Night and day—day in comparison with
unbelievers, night in comparison with the Angels. For the Angels have a day, which we have
not yet. Already we have one that unbelievers have not: but not yet have believers that which
Angels have: but they will have, at the time when they will be equal to the Angels of God,
that which hath been promised to them in the Resurrection.3495 In this then which is now
day and yet night; night in comparison with the future day for which we yearn, day in
comparison with the past night which we have renounced: in this night then, I say, let us
seek God with our hands. Let not works cease, let us seek God, be there no idle yearning. If
we are in the way, let us expend our means in order that we may be able to reach the end.
With hands let us seek God.…“With my hands in the night before Him, and I have not been
deceived.”
5. …“My soul hath refused to be comforted” (ver. 2). So great weariness did here possess
me, that my soul did close the door against all comfort. Whence such weariness to him? It
may be that his vineyard hath been hailed on, or his olive hath yielded no fruit, or the vintage
hath been interrupted by rain. Whence the weariness to him? Hear this out of another Psalm.
For therein is the voice of the same: “weariness hath bowed me down, because of sinners
forsaking Thy law.”3496 He saith then that he was overcome with so great weariness because
of this sort of evil thing; so as that his soul refused to be comforted. Weariness had well nigh
swallowed him up, and sorrow had ingulfed him altogether beyond remedy, he refuseth to
be comforted. What then remained? In the first place, see whence he is comforted. Had he
not waited for one who might condole with him?3497…“I have been mindful of God, and I
have been delighted” (ver. 3). My hands had not wrought in vain, they had found a great
comforter. While not being idle, “I have been mindful of God, and I have been delighted.”
God must therefore be praised, of whom this man being mindful, hath been delighted, and
hath been comforted in sorrowful case, and refreshed when safety was in a manner despaired
of: God must therefore be praised. In fine, because he hath been comforted, in continuation
he saith, “I have babbled.” In that same comfort being made mindful of God, I have been
delighted, and have “babbled.” What is, “I have babbled”? I have rejoiced, I have exulted in
speaking. For babblers they are properly called, that by the common people are named
3494 1 Thess. v. 19.
3495 Matt. xxii. 30.
3496 Ps. cxix. 53.
3497 Ps. lxviii. 20.
Psalm LXXVII
talkative, who at the approach of joy are neither able nor willing to be silent. This man hath
become such an one. And again he saith what? “And my spirit hath fainted.”
6. With weariness he had pined away; by calling to mind God, he had been delighted,
again in babbling he had fainted: what followeth? “All mine enemies have anticipated
watches” (ver. 4). All mine enemies have kept watch over me; they have exceeded in keeping
watch over me; in watching they have been beforehand with me. Where do they not lay
traps? Have not mine enemies anticipated all watches? For who are these enemies, but they
of whom the Apostle saith, “Ye have not wrestling against flesh and blood.”3498…Against
the devil and his angels we are waging hostilities. Rulers of the world he hath called them,
because they do themselves rule the lovers of the world. For they do not rule the world, as
if they were rulers of heaven and earth: but he is calling sinners the world.…With the devil
and his angels there is no concord. They do themselves grudge us the kingdom of Heaven.
They cannot at all be appeased towards us: because “all mine enemies have anticipated
watches.” They have watched more to deceive than I to guard myself. For how can they have
done otherwise than anticipate watches, that have set everywhere scandals, everywhere
traps? Weariness doth invest the heart, we have to fear lest sorrow swallow us up: in joy to
fear lest the spirit faint in babbling: “all mine enemies have anticipated watches.” In fine, in
the midst of that same babbling, whiles thou art speaking, and art speaking without fear,
how much is oft-times found which enemies would lay hold of and censure, whereon they
would even found accusation and slander—“he said so, he thought so, he spake so!” What
should man do, save that which followeth? “I have been troubled, and I spake not.” Therefore
when he was troubled, lest in his babbling enemies anticipating watches should seek and
find slanders, he spake not.…
7. “I have thought on ancient days” (ver. 5). Now he, as if he were one who had been
beaten out of doors, hath taken refuge within: he is conversing in the secret place of his own
heart. And let him declare to us what he is doing there. It is well with him. Observe what
things he is thinking of, I pray you. He is within, in his own house he is thinking of ancient
days. No one saith to him, thou hast spoken ill: no one saith to him, thou hast spoken much:
no one saith to him, thou hast thought perversely. Thus may it be well with him, may God
aid him: let him think of the ancient days, and let him tell us what he hath done in his very
inner chamber, whereunto he hath arrived, over what he hath leaped, where he hath abode.
“I have thought on ancient days; and of eternal years I have been mindful.” What are
eternal years? It is a mighty thought. See whether this thought requireth anything but great
silence. Apart from all noise without, from all tumult of things human let him remain quiet
within, that would think of those eternal years. Are the years wherein we are eternal, or
those wherein our ancestors have been, or those wherein our posterity are to be? Far be it
3498 Eph. vi. 12.
Psalm LXXVII
that they should be esteemed eternal. For what part of these years doth remain? Behold we
speak and say, “in this year:” and what have we got of this year, save the one day wherein
we are. For the former days of this year have already gone by, and are not to be had; but the
future days have not yet come. In one day we are, and we say, in this year: nay rather say
thou, to-day, if thou desirest to speak of anything present. For of the whole year what hast
thou got that is present? Whatsoever thereof is past, is no longer; whatsoever thereof is future,
is not yet: how then, “this year”? Amend the expression: say, to-day. Thou speakest truth,
henceforth I will say, “to-day.” Again observe this too, how to-day the morning hours have
already past, the future hours have not yet come. This too therefore amend: say, in this hour.
And of this hour what hast thou got? Some moments thereof have already gone by, those
that are future have not yet come. Say, in this moment. In what moment? While I am uttering
syllables, if I shall speak two syllables, the latter doth not sound until the former hath gone
by: in a word, in that same one syllable, if it chance to have two letters, the latter letter doth
not sound, until the former hath gone by. What then have we got of these years? These years
are changeable: the eternal years must be thought on, years that stand, that are not made
up of days that come and depart; years whereof in another place the Scripture saith to God,
“But Thou art the Self-same, and Thy years shall not fail.”3499 On these years this man that
leapeth over, not in babbling without, but in silence3500 hath thought.
8. “And I have meditated in the night with my heart” (ver. 6). No slanderous person
seeketh for snares in his words, in his heart he hath meditated. “I babbled.” Behold there is
the former babbling. Watch again, that thy spirit faint not. I did not, he saith, I did not so
babble as if it were abroad: in another way now. How now? “I did babble, and did search
out my spirit.” If he were searching the earth to find veins of gold, no one would say that
he was foolish; nay, many men would call him wise, for desiring to come at gold: how great
treasures hath a man within, and he diggeth not! This man was examining his spirit, and
was speaking with that same his spirit, and in the very speaking he was babbling. He was
questioning himself, was examining himself, was judge over himself. And he continueth; “I
did search my spirit.” He had to fear lest he should stay within his own spirit: for he had
babbled without; and because all his enemies had anticipated watches, he found there sorrow,
and his spirit fainted. He that did babble without, lo, now doth begin to babble within in
safety, where being alone in secret, he is thinking on eternal years.…
9. And thou hast found what? “God will not repel for everlasting” (ver. 7). Weariness
he had found in this life; in no place a trustworthy, in no place a fearless comfort. Unto
whatsoever men he betook himself, in them he found scandal, or feared it. In no place
therefore was he free from care. An evil thing it was for him to hold his peace, lest perchance
3499 Ps. cii. 27.
3500 Oxf. mss. “his own silence.”
Psalm LXXVII
he should keep silence from good words; to speak and babble without was painful to him,
lest all his enemies, anticipating watches, should seek slanders in his words. Being exceedingly
straitened in this life, he thought much of another life, where there is not this trial. And
when is he to arrive thither? For it cannot but be evident that our suffering here is the anger
of God. This thing is spoken of in Isaiah, “I will not be an avenger unto you for everlasting,
nor will I be angry with you at all times.” 3501…Will this anger of God always abide? This
man hath not found this in silence. For he saith what? “God will not repel for everlasting,
and He will not add any more that it should be well-pleasing to Him still.” That is, that it
should be well-pleasing to Him still to repel, and He will not add the repelling for everlasting.
He must needs recall to Himself His servants, He must needs receive fugitives returning to
the Lord, He must needs hearken to the voice of them that are in fetters. “Or unto the end
will He cut off mercy from generation to generation?” (ver. 8).
10. “Or will God forget to be merciful?” (ver. 9). In thee, from thee unto another there
is no mercy unless God bestow it on thee: and shall God Himself forget mercy? The stream
runneth: shall the spring itself be dried up? “Or shall God forget to be merciful: or shall He
keep back in anger His mercies?” That is, shall He be so angry, as that He will not have
mercy? He will more easily keep back anger than mercy.
11. “And I said.” Now leaping over himself he hath said what? “Now I have begun:”
(ver. 10), when I had gone out even from myself. Here henceforth there is no danger: for
even to remain in myself, was danger. “And I said, Now I have begun: this is the changing
of the right hand of the Lofty One.” Now the Lofty One hath begun to change me: now I
have begun something wherein I am secure: now I have entered a certain palace3502 of joys,
wherein no enemy is to be feared: now I have begun to be in that region, where all mine
enemies do not anticipate watches. “Now I have begun: this is the changing of the right
hand of the Lofty One.”
12. “I have been mindful of the works of the Lord” (ver. 11). Now behold him roaming
among the works of the Lord. For he was babbling without, and being made sorrowful
thereby his spirit fainted: he babbled within with his own heart, and with his spirit, and
having searched out that same spirit he was mindful of the eternal years, was mindful of the
mercy of the Lord, how God will not repel him for everlasting; and he began now fearlessly
to rejoice in His works, fearlessly to exult in the same. Let us hear now those very works,
and let us too exult. But let even us leap over in our affections, and not rejoice in things
temporal. For we too have our bed. Why do we not enter therein? Why do we not abide in
silence? Why do we not search out our spirit? Why do we not think on the eternal years?
Why do we not rejoice in the works of God? In such sort now let us hear, and let us take
3501 Isa. lvii. 16.
3502 Al. “air.”
Psalm LXXVII
delight in Himself speaking, in order that when we shall have departed hence, we may do
that which we used to do while He spake; if only we are making the beginning of Him
whereof he spake in, “Now I have begun.” To rejoice in the works of God, is to forget even
thyself, if thou canst delight in Him alone. For what is a better thing than He? Dost thou
not see that, when thou returnest to thyself, thou returnest to a worse thing? “for I shall be
mindful from the beginning of Thy wonderful works.”
13. “And I will meditate on all Thy works, and on Thy affections I will babble” (ver. 12).
Behold the third babbling! He babbled without, when he hinted; he babbled in his spirit
within, when he advanced: he babbled on the works of God, when he arrived at the place
toward which he advanced. “And on Thy affections:” not on any affections. What man doth
live without affections? And do ye suppose, brethren, that they who fear God, worship God,
love God, have not any affections? Wilt thou indeed suppose and dare to suppose, that
painting, the theatre, hunting, hawking, fishing, engage the affections, and the meditation
on God doth not engage certain interior affections of its own, while we contemplate the
universe, and place before our eyes the spectacle of the natural world, and therein labour
to discover the Maker, and find Him nowhere unpleasing, but pleasing above 3503 all things?
14. “O God, Thy way is in the Holy One” (ver. 13). He is contemplating now the works
of the mercy of God around us, out of these he is babbling, and in these affections he is ex-
ulting. At first he is beginning from thence, “Thy way is in the Holy One?” What is that way
of Thine which is in the Holy One? “I am,” He saith, “the Way, the Truth, and the Life.”3504
Return therefore, ye men, from your affections.…“Who is a great God, like our God?”3505
Gentiles have their affections regarding their gods, they adore idols, they have eyes and they
see not; ears they have and they hear not; feet they have and they walk not. Why dost thou
walk to a God that walketh not? I do not, he saith, worship such things, and what dost thou
worship? The divinity which is there. Thou dost then worship that whereof hath been said
elsewhere, “for the Gods of the nations are demons.”3506 Thou dost either worship idols,
or devils. Neither idols, nor devils, he saith. And what dost thou worship? The stars, sun,
moon, those things celestial. How much better Him that hath made both things earthly and
things celestial. “Who is a great God like our God?”
15. “Thou art the God that doest wonderful things alone” (ver. 14). Thou art indeed a
great God, doing wonderful things in body, in soul; alone doing them. The deaf have heard,
the blind have seen, the feeble have recovered, the dead have risen, the paralytic have been
strengthened. But these miracles were at that time performed on bodies, let us see those
3503 One ms. “through.”
3504 John xiv. 6.
3505 Ps. cxiii. 5.
3506 Ps. cxxxv. 15.
Psalm LXXVII
wrought on the soul. Sober are those that were a little before drunken, believers are those
that were a little before worshippers of idols: their goods they bestow on the poor that did
rob before those of others.…“Wonderful things alone.” Moses too did them, but not alone:
Elias too did them, even Eliseus did them, the Apostles too did them, but no one of them
alone. That they might have power to do them, Thou wast with them: when Thou didst
them they were not with Thee. For they were not with Thee when Thou didst them, inasmuch
as Thou didst make even these very men. How “alone”? Is it perchance the Father, and not
the Son? Or the Son, and not the Father? Nay, but Father and Son and Holy Ghost. For it
is not three Gods but one God that doeth wonderful things alone, and even in this very
leaper-over. For even his leaping over and arriving at these things was a miracle of God:
when he was babbling within with his own spirit, in order that he might leap over even that
same spirit of his, and might delight in the works of God, he then did wonderful things
himself. But God hath done what? “Thou hast made known unto the people Thy power.”3507
Thence this congregation of Asaph leaping over; because He hath made known in the peoples
His virtue. What virtue of His hath He made known in the peoples? “But we preach Christ
crucified,…Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.”3508 If then the virtue of God
is Christ, He hath made known Christ in the peoples. Do we not yet perceive so much as
this; and are we so unwise, are we lying so much below, do we so leap over nothing, as that
we see not this?
16. “Thou hast redeemed in Thine arm Thy people” (ver. 15). “With Thine arm,” that
is, with Thy power. “And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?”3509 “Thou hast
redeemed in Thine arm Thy people, the sons of Israel and of Joseph.” How as if two peoples,
“the sons of Israel and of Joseph”? Are not the sons of Joseph among the sons of Israel?…He
hath admonished us of some distinction to be made. Let us search out our spirit, perchance
God hath placed there something—God whom we ought even by night to seek with our
hands, in order that we may not be deceived—perchance we shall discover even ourselves
in this distinction of “sons of Israel and of Joseph.” By Joseph He hath willed another people
to be understood, hath willed that the people of the Gentiles be understood. Why the people
of the Gentiles by Joseph? Because Joseph was sold into Egypt by his brethren.3510 That
Joseph whom the brethren envied, and sold him into Egypt, when sold into Egypt, toiled,
was humbled; when made known and exalted, flourished, reigned. And by all these things
he hath signified what? What but Christ sold by His brethren, banished from His own land,
as it were into the Egypt of the Gentiles? There at first humbled, when the Martyrs were

Psalm LXXVII
suffering persecutions: now exalted, as we see; inasmuch as there hath been fulfilled in Him,
“There shall adore Him all kinds of the earth, all nations shall serve Him.”3511 Therefore
Joseph is the people of the Gentiles, but Israel the people of the Hebrew nation. God hath
redeemed His people, “the sons of Israel and of Joseph.” By means of what? By means of
the corner stone,3512 wherein the two walls have been joined together.
17. And he continueth how? “The waters have seen Thee, O God, and they have feared
and the abysses have been troubled” (ver. 16). What are the waters? The peoples. What are
these waters hath been asked in the Apocalypse,3513 the answer was, the peoples. There we
find most clearly waters put by a figure for peoples. But above he had said, “Thou hast made
known in the peoples Thy virtue.”3514 With reason therefore, “the waters have seen Thee,
and they have feared.” They have been changed because they have feared. What are the
abysses? The depths of waters. What man among the peoples is not troubled, when the
conscience is smitten? Thou seekest the depth of the sea, what is deeper than human con-
science? That is the depth which was troubled, when God redeemed with His arm His people.
In what manner were the abysses troubled? When all men poured forth their consciences
in confession.
18. In praises of God, in confessions of sins, in hymns and in songs, in prayers, “There
is a multitude of the sound of waters. The clouds have uttered a voice” (ver. 17). Thence
that sound of waters, thence the troubling of the abysses, because “the clouds have uttered
a voice.” What clouds? The preachers of the word of truth. What clouds? Those concerning
which God doth menace a certain vineyard, which instead of grape had brought forth thorns
and He saith, “I will command My clouds, that they rain no rain upon it.”3515 In a word,
the Apostles forsaking the Jews, went to the Gentiles: in preaching Christ among all nations,
“the clouds have uttered a voice.” “For Thine arrows have gone through.” Those same voices
of the clouds He hath again called arrows. For the words of the Evangelists were arrows.
For these things are allegories. For properly neither an arrow is rain, nor rain is an arrow:
but yet the word of God is both an arrow because it doth smite; and rain because it doth
water. Let no one therefore any longer wonder at the troubling of the abysses, when “Thine
arrows have gone through.” What is, “have gone through”? They have not stopped in the
ears, but they have pierced the heart. “The voice of Thy thunder is in the wheel” (ver. 18).
What is this? How are we to understand it? May the Lord give aid. When boys we were wont
to imagine, whenever we heard thunderings from Heaven, that carriages were going forth

as it were from the stables. For thunder doth make a sort of rolling like carriages. Must we
return to these boyish thoughts, in order to understand, “the voice of Thy thunder is in the
wheel,” as though God hath certain carriages in the clouds, and the passing along of the
carriages doth raise that sound? Far be it. This is boyish, vain, trifling. What is then, “The
voice of Thy thunder is in the wheel”? Thy voice rolleth. Not even this do I understand.
What shall we do? Let us question Idithun himself, to see whether perchance he may himself
explain what he hath said: “The voice,” he saith, “of Thy thunder is in the wheel.” I do not
understand. I will hear what thou sayest: “Thy lightnings have appeared to the round world.”
Say then, I had no understanding. The round world is a wheel.3516 For the circuit of the
round world is with reason called also an “orb:” whence also a small wheel is called an “or-
biculus.” “The voice of Thy thunder is in the wheel:” Thy “lightnings have appeared to the
round world.” Those clouds in a wheel have gone about the round world, have gone about
with thundering and with lightning, they have shaken the abyss, with commandments they
have thundered, with miracles they have lightened. “Unto every land hath gone forth the
sound of them, and unto the ends of the orb the words of them.”3517 “The land hath been
moved and made to tremble:” that is, all men that dwell in the land. But by a figure the land
itself is sea. Why? Because all nations are called by the name of sea, inasmuch as human life
is bitter, and exposed to storms and tempests. Moreover if thou observe this, how men devour
one another like fishes, how the stronger doth swallow up the weaker—it is then a sea, unto
it the Evangelists went.
19. “Thy way is in the sea” (ver. 19). But now Thy way was in the Holy One, now “Thy
way is in the sea:” because the Holy One Himself is in the sea, and with reason even did
walk upon the waters of the sea.3518 “Thy way is in the sea,” that is, Thy Christ is preached
among the Gentiles.…“Thy way is in the sea, and Thy paths in many waters,” that is, in
many peoples. “And Thy footsteps will not be known.” He hath touched certain, and wonder
were it if it be not those same Jews. Behold now the mercy of Christ hath been so published
to the Gentiles, that “Thy way is in the sea. Thy footsteps will not be known.” How so, by
whom will they not be known, save by those who still say, Christ hath not yet come? Why
do they say, Christ hath not yet come? Because they do not yet recognise Him walking on
the sea.
20. “Thou hast led home Thy people like sheep in the hand of Moses and of Aaron”
(ver. 20). Why He hath added this is somewhat difficult to discover.…They banished Christ;
sick as they were, they would not have Him for their Saviour; but He began to be among
the Gentiles, and among all nations, among many peoples. Nevertheless, a remnant of that

Psalm LXXVII
people hath been saved. The ungrateful multitude hath remained without, even the halting
breadth of Jacob’s thigh.3519 For the breadth of the thigh is understood of the multitude of
lineage, and among the greater part of the Israelites a certain multitude became vain and
foolish, so as not to know the steps of Christ on the waters. “Thou hast led home Thy people
like sheep,” and they have not known Thee. Though Thou hast done such great benefits
unto them, hast divided sea, hast made them pass over dry land between waters, hast drowned
in the waves pursuing enemies, in the desert hast rained manna for their hunger, leading
them home “by the hand of Moses and Aaron:” still they thrust Thee from them, so that in
the sea was Thy Way, and Thy steps they knew not.

Psalm LXXVII
Psalm LXXVIII.3520
1. This Psalm3521 doth contain the things which are said to have been done among the
old people: but the new and latter people is being admonished, to beware that it be not un-
grateful regarding the blessings of God, and provoke His anger against it, whereas it ought
to receive His grace.…The Title thereof doth first move and engage our attention. For it is
not without reason inscribed, “Understanding3522 of Asaph:” but it is perchance because
these words require a reader who doth perceive not the voice which the surface uttereth,
but some inward sense. Secondly, when about to narrate and mention all these things, which
seem to need a hearer more than an expounder: “I will open,” he saith, “in parables my
mouth, I will declare propositions from the beginning.”3523 Who would not herein be
awakened out of sleep? Who would dare to hurry over the parables and propositions, reading
them as if self-evident, while by their very names they signify that they ought to be sought
out with deeper view? For a parable hath on the surface thereof the similitude of something:
and though it be a Greek word, it is now used as a Latin word. And it is observable, that in
parables, those which are called the similitudes of things are compared with things with
which we have to do. But propositions, which in Greek are called προβήλματα, are questions
having something therein which is to be solved by disputation. What man then would read
parables and propositions cursorily? What man would not attend while hearing these words
with watchful mind, in order that by understanding he may come by the fruit thereof?
2. “Hearken ye,” He saith, “My people, to My law” (ver. 1). Whom may we suppose to
be here speaking, but God? For it was Himself that gave a law to His people, whom when
delivered out of Egypt He gathered together, the which gathering together is properly named
a Synagogue, which the word Asaph is interpreted to signify. Hath it then been said, “Un-
derstanding of Asaph,” in the sense that Asaph himself hath understood; or must it be fig-
uratively understood, in the sense that the same Synagogue, that is, the same people, hath
understood, unto whom is said, “Hearken, My people, unto My law”? Why is it then that
He is rebuking the same people by the mouth of the Prophet, saying, “But Israel hath not
known Me, and My people hath not understood”?3524 But, in fact, there were even in that
people they that understood, having the faith which was afterwards revealed, not pertaining
to the letter of the law, but the grace of the Spirit. For they cannot have been without the
same faith, who were able to foresee and foretell the revelation thereof that should be in
Christ, inasmuch as even those old Sacraments were significants of those that should be.

Psalm LXXVIII
Psalm LXXVIII
Had the prophets alone this faith, and not the people too? Nay indeed, but even they that
faithfully heard the Prophets, were aided by the same grace in order that they might under-
stand what they heard. But without doubt the mystery3525 of the Kingdom of Heaven was
veiled in the Old Testament, which in the fulness of time should be unveiled in the New.3526
“For,” saith the Apostle, “they did drink of the Spiritual Rock following them, but the Rock
was Christ.”3527 In a mystery therefore theirs was the same meat and drink as ours, but in
signification the same, not in form;3528 because the same Christ was Himself figured to
them in a Rock, manifested to us in the Flesh. “But,” he saith, “not in all of them God was
well pleased.”3529 All indeed ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink,
that is to say, signifying something spiritual: but not in all of them was God well pleased.
When, he saith, “not in all:” there were evidently there some in whom was God well pleased;
and although all the Sacraments were common, grace, which is the virtue of the Sacraments,
was not common to all. Just as in our times, now that the faith hath been revealed, which
then was veiled, to all men that have been baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost,3530 the Laver of regeneration is common; but the very grace
whereof these same are the Sacraments, whereby the members of the Body of Christ are to
reign3531 together with their Head, is not common to all. For even heretics have the same
Baptism, and false brethren too, in the communion of the Catholic name.
3. Nevertheless, neither then nor now without profit is the voice of him, saying, “Hearken
ye, My people, to My law.” Which expression is remarkable in all the Scriptures, how he
saith not, “hearken thou,” but, “hearken ye.” For of many men a people doth consist: to
which many that which followeth is spoken in the plural number. “Incline ye your ear unto
the words of My mouth.” “Hearken ye,” is the same as, “Incline your ear:” and what He saith
there, “My law,” this He saith here in, “the words of My mouth.” For that man doth godly
hearken to the law of God, and the words of His mouth, whose ear humility doth incline:
not he whose neck pride doth lift up. For whatever is poured in is received on the concave
surface of humility, is shaken off from the convexity of swelling. Whence in another place,
“Incline,” he saith, “thine ear, and receive the words of understanding.” 3532 We have been
therefore sufficiently admonished to receive even this Psalm of this understanding of As-
3525 Sacramentum.

Psalm LXXVIII
aph,3533 to receive, I say, with inclined ear, that is, with humble piety. And it hath not been
spoken of as being of Asaph himself, but to Asaph himself. Which thing is evident by the
Greek article, and is found in certain Latin copies. These words therefore are of understand-
ing, that is, of intelligence, which hath been given to Asaph himself: which we had better
understand not as to one man, but as to the congregation of the people of God; whence we
ought by no means to alienate ourselves. For although properly we say “Synagogue” of Jews,
but “Church” of Christians, because a “Congregation”3534 is wont to be understood as rather
of beasts, but a “convocation” as rather of men: yet that too we find called a Church, and it
perhaps is more suitable for us3535 to say, “Save us, O Lord, our God, and congregate us
from the nations, in order that we may confess to Thy Holy Name.”3536 Neither ought we
to disdain to be, nay we ought to render ineffable thanks, for that we are, the sheep of His
hands, which He foresaw when He was saying, “I have other sheep which are not of this
fold, them too I must lead in, that there may be one flock and one Shepherd:”3537 that is to
say, by joining the faithful people of the Gentiles with the faithful people of the Israelites,
concerning whom He had before said, “I have not been sent but to the sheep which have
strayed of the house of Israel.”3538 For also there shall be congregated before Him all nations,
and He shall sever them as a shepherd the sheep from the goats.3539 Thus then let us hear
that which hath been spoken. “Hearken ye, My people, to My law, incline ye your ear unto
the words of My mouth:” not as if addressed to Jews, but rather as if addressed to ourselves,
or at least as if these words were said as well to ourselves (as to them3540). For when the
Apostle had said, “But not in all them was God well pleased,” thereby showing that there
were those too in whom God was well pleased: he hath forthwith added, “For they were
overthrown in the desert:”3541 secondly he hath continued, “but these things have been
made our figures.”…To us therefore more particularly these words have been sung. Whence
in this Psalm among other things there hath been said, “That another generation may know,
sons who shall be born and shall arise.”3542 Moreover, if that death by serpents, and that
3533 [He subjoins as follows: “For the word on the Title is put in the genitive case: hujus intellectûs, not hic
intellectus.”—C.]

atio as Latin for ecclesia, which expresses calling.

Psalm LXXVIII
destruction by the destroyer, and the slaying by the sword, were figures, as the Apostle
evidently doth declare, inasmuch as it is manifest that all those things did happen: for he
saith not, in a figure they were spoken, or, in a figure they were written, but, in a figure, he
saith, they happened to them: with how much greater diligence of godliness must those
punishments be shunned whereof those were the figures? For beyond a doubt as in good
things there is much more of good in that which is signified by the figure, than in the figure
itself: so also in evil things very far worse are the things which are signified by the figures,
while so great are the evil things which as figures do signify. For as the land of promise,
whereunto that people was being led, is nothing in comparison with the Kingdom of
Heaven, whereunto the Christian people is being led: so also those punishments which were
figures, though they were so severe, are nothing in comparison with the punishments which
they signify. But those which the Apostle hath called figures, the same this Psalm, as far as
we are able to judge, calleth parables and propositions: not having their end in the fact of
their having happened, but in those things whereunto they are referred by a reasonable
comparison. Let us therefore hearken unto the law of God—us His people—and let us incline
our ear unto the words of His mouth.
4. “I will open,” he saith, “in parables My mouth, I will declare propositions from the
beginning” (ver. 2). From what beginning he meaneth, is very evident in the words following.
For it is not from the beginning, what time the Heaven and earth were made, nor what time
mankind was created in the first man: but what time the congregation that was led out of
Egypt; in order that the sense may belong to Asaph, which is interpreted a congregation.
But O that He that hath said, “I will open in parables My mouth,” would also vouchsafe to
open our understanding unto them! For if, as He hath opened His mouth in parables, He
would in like sort open the parables themselves: and as He declareth “propositions,” He
would declare in like sort the expositions thereof, we should not be here toiling: but now so
hidden and closed are all things, that even if we are able by His aid to arrive at anything,
whereon we may feed to our health, still we must eat the bread in the sweat of our face; and
pay the penalty of the ancient sentence3543 not with the labour of the body only, but also
with that of the heart. Let him speak then, and let us hear the parables and propositions.
5. “How great things we have heard, and have known them, and our fathers have told
them to us” (ver. 3). The Lord was speaking higher up. For of what other person could these
words be thought to be, “Hearken ye, O My people, to My law”?3544 Why is it then that now
on a sudden a man is speaking, for here we have the words of a man, “our fathers have told
them to us.” Without doubt God, now about to speak by a man’s ministry, as the Apostle
saith, “Will ye to receive proof of Him that is speaking in me, Christ?”3545 in His own person

3544 Ps. lxxviii. 1.

Psalm LXXVIII
at first willed the words to be uttered, lest a man speaking His words should be despised as
a man. For it is thus with the sayings of God which make their way to us through our bodily
sense. The Creator moveth the subject creature by an invisible working; not so that the
substance is changed into anything corporal and temporal, when by means of corporal and
temporal signs, whether belonging to the eyes or to the ears, as far as men are able to receive
it, He would make His will to be known. For if an angel is able to use air, mist, cloud, fire,
and any other natural substance or corporal species;3546 and man to use face, tongue, hand,
pen, letters, or any other significants, for the purpose of intimating the secret things of his
own mind: in a word, if, though he is a man, he sendeth human messengers, and he saith
to one, “Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to his servant, Do
this, and he doeth it;”3547 with how much greater and more effectual power doth God, to
whom as Lord all things together are subject, use both the same angel and man, in order
that He may declare whatsoever pleaseth Him?…For those things were heard in the Old
Testament which are known in the New: heard when they were being prophesied, known
when they were being fulfilled. Where a promise is performed, hearing is not deceived. “And
our fathers,” Moses and the Prophets, “have told unto us.”
6. “They have not been hidden from their sons in another generation” (ver. 4). This is
our generation wherein there hath been given to us regeneration. “Telling forth the praises
of the Lord and His powers, and His wonderful works which He hath done.” The order of
the words is, “and our fathers have told unto us, telling forth the praises of the Lord.” The
Lord is praised, in order that He may be loved. For what object can be loved more to our
health? “And He hath raised up a testimony in Jacob, and hath set a law in Jacob” (ver. 5).
This is the beginning whereof hath been spoken above, “I will declare propositions from
the beginning.”3548 So then the beginning is the Old Testament, the end is the New. For
fear doth prevail in the law.3549 “But the end of the law is Christ for righteousness to every
one believing;”3550 at whose bestowing “love is shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy
Spirit, which hath been given to us:”3551 and love made perfect doth cast out fear,3552 inas-
much as now without the Law the righteousness of God hath been made manifest. But

Psalm LXXVIII
inasmuch as He hath a testimony by the Law and the Prophets,3553 therefore, “He hath
raised up a testimony in Jacob.” For even that Tabernacle which was set up with a work so
remarkable and full of such wondrous meanings, is named the Tabernacle of Testimony,
wherein was the veil over the Ark of the Law, like the veil over the face of the Minister of
the Law;3554 because in that dispensation there were “parables and propositions.” For those
things which were being preached and were coining to pass were hidden in veiled meanings,
and were not seen in unveiled manifestations. But “when thou shalt have passed over unto
Christ,” saith the Apostle, “the veil shall be taken away.”3555 For “all the promises of God
in Him are yea, Amen.”3556 Whosoever therefore doth cleave to Christ, hath the whole of
the good which even in the letters of the Law he perceiveth not: but whosoever is an alien
from Christ, doth neither perceive, nor hath. “He hath set a law in Israel.” After his usual
custom he is making a repetition. For “He hath raised up a testimony,” is the same as, “He
hath set a law,” and “in Jacob,” is the same as “in Israel.” For as these are two names of one
man, so law and testimony are two names of one thing. Is there any difference, saith some
one, between “hath raised up” and “hath set”? Yea indeed, the same difference as there is
between “Jacob” and “Israel:” not because they were two persons, but these same two names
were bestowed upon one man for different reasons; Jacob because of supplanting, for that
he grasped the foot of his brother at his birth:3557 but Israel because of the vision of God.3558
So “raised up” is one thing, “set” is another. For, “He hath raised up a testimony,” as far as
I can judge, hath been said because by it something has been raised up; “For without the
Law,” saith the Apostle, “sin was dead: but I lived sometime without the Law: but at the
coming in of the commandment sin revived.”3559 Behold that which hath been raised up
by the testimony, which is the Law, so that what was lying hidden might appear, as he saith
a little afterwards: “But sin, that it might appear sin, through a good thing hath wrought in
me death.”3560 But “He hath set a law,” hath been said, as though it were a yoke upon sinners,
whence hath been said, “For upon a just man law hath not been imposed.”3561 It is a testi-
mony then, so far forth as it doth prove anything; but a law so far forth as it doth command;
though it is one and the same thing. Wherefore just as Christ is a stone, but to believers for

the Head of the corner, while to unbelievers a stone of offence and a rock of scandal;3562 so
the testimony of the Law to them that use not the Law lawfully,3563 is a testimony whereby
sinners are to be convicted as deserving of punishment; but to them that use the same law-
fully, is a testimony whereby sinners are shown unto whom they ought to flee in order to
be delivered.…
7. “How great things,” he saith, “He hath commanded our fathers, to make the same
known to their sons?” (ver. 5). “That another generation may know, sons who shall be born
and shall rise up, and they may tell to their sons” (ver. 6). “That they may put their hope in
God, and may not forget the works of God, and may seek out His commandments” (ver.
7). “That they may not become, like their fathers, a crooked and embittering generation: a
generation that hath not guided their heart, and the spirit thereof hath not been trusted with
God” (ver. 8). These words do point out two peoples as it were, the one belonging to the
Old Testament, the other to the New: for in that he saith, he hath implied that they received
the commandments, “to make them known to their sons,” but that they did not know or
do them: but they received them themselves, to the end “that another generation might
know,” what the former knew not. “Sons who shall be born and shall arise.” For they that
have been born have not arisen: because they had not their heart above, but rather on the
earth. For the arising is with Christ: whence hath been said, “If ye have arisen with Christ,
savour ye the things which are above.”3564 “And they may tell them,” he saith, “to their sons,
in order that they may put their hope in God.”…“And may not forget the works of God:”
that is to say, in magnifying and vaunting their own works, as though they did them them-
selves; while “God it is that worketh,” in them that work good things, “both to will and to
work according to good will.”3565 “And may search out His commandments.”…The com-
mandments which He hath commanded. How then should they still search out, whereas
they have already learned them, save that by putting their hope in God, they do then search
out His commandments, in order that by them, with His aid, they may be fulfilled? And he
saith why, by immediately subjoining, “and its spirit hath not been trusted with God,” that
is, because it had no faith, which doth obtain what the Law doth enjoin. For when the spirit
of man doth work together with the Spirit of God working, then there is fulfilled that which
God hath commanded: and this doth not come to pass, except by believing in Him that doth
justify an ungodly man.3566 Which faith the generation crooked and embittering had not:
and therefore concerning the same hath been said, “The spirit thereof hath not been trusted

with God.” For this hath been said much more exactly to point out the grace of God, which
doth work not only remission of sins, but also doth make the spirit of man to work together
therewith in the work of good deeds, as though he were saying, his spirit hath not believed
in God. For to have the spirit trusted with God, is, not to believe that his spirit is able to do
righteousness without God, but with God. For this is to believe in God: which is surely more
than to believe God. For ofttimes we must believe even a man, though in him we must not
believe. To believe in God therefore is this, in believing to cleave unto God who worketh
good works, in order to work with Him well.…
8. Lastly, “The sons of Ephrem bending and shooting bows, have been turned back in
the day of war” (ver. 9). Following after the law of righteousness, unto the law of righteousness
they have not attained.3567 Why? Because they were not of faith. For they were that generation
whereof the spirit hath not been trusted with God: but they were, so to speak, of works: be-
cause they did not, as they bended and shot their bows (which are outward actions, as of
the works of the law), so guide their heart also, wherein the just man doth live by faith, which
worketh by love; whereby men cleave to God, who worketh in man both to will and work
according to good will. 3568 For what else is bending the bow and shooting, and turning
back in the day of war, but heeding and purposing in the day of hearing, and deserting in
the day of temptation; flourishing arms, so to speak, beforehand, and at the hour of the action
refusing to fight? But whereas he saith, “bending and shooting bows,” when it would seem
that he ought to have said, bending bows and shooting arrows.…Some Greek copies to be
sure are said to have “bending and shooting with bows,” so that without doubt we ought to
understand arrows. But whereas by the sons of Ephrem he hath willed that there be under-
stood the whole of that embittering generation, it is an expression signifying the whole by
a part. And perhaps this part was chosen whereby to signify the whole, because from these
men especially some good thing was to have been expected.…Although set at the left hand
by his father as being the younger, Jacob nevertheless blessed with his right hand, and pre-
ferred him before his elder brother with a benediction of hidden meaning.3569…For there
was being figured how they were to be last that were first, and first were to be they that were
last,3570 through the Saviour’s coming, concerning whom hath been said, “He that is coming
after me was made before me.”3571 In like manner righteous Abel was preferred before the
elder brother; so to Ismael Isaac; so to Esau, though born before him, his twin brother Jacob;
so also Phares himself preceded even in birth his twin brother, who had first thrust a hand

out of the womb, and had begun to be born:3572 so David was preferred before his elder
brother:3573 and as the reason why all these parables and others like them preceded, not
only of words but also of deeds, in like manner to the people of the Jews was preferred the
Christian people, for redeeming the which as Abel by Cain,3574 so by the Jews was slain
Christ. This thing was prefigured even when Jacob stretching out his hands cross-wise, with
his right hand touched Ephrem standing on the left; and set him before Manasse standing
on the right, whom he himself touched with the left hand.3575
9. But what that is which he saith, “they have been turned back in the day of war,” the
following words do teach, wherein he hath most clearly explained this: “they have not kept,”
he saith, “the testament of God, and in His law they would not walk” (ver. 10). Behold what
is, “they have been turned back in the day of war:” they have not kept the testament of God.
When they were bending and shooting bows, they did also utter the words of most forward
promise, saying, “Whatsoever things the Lord our God hath spoken we will do, and we will
hear.”3576 “They have been turned back in the day of war:” because the promise of obedience
not hearing but temptation doth prove. But he whose spirit hath been trusted with God,
keepeth hold on God, who is faithful, and “doth not suffer him to be tempted above that
which he is able; but will make with the temptation a way of escape also,”3577 that he may
be able to endure, and may not be turned back in the day of war.…Therefore these men
have been thus branded: “a generation,” he saith, “which hath not directed their heart.”3578
It hath not been said, works, but heart. For when the heart is directed, the works are right;
but when the heart is not directed, the works are not right, even though they seem to be
right. And how the crooked generation hath not directed the heart, hath sufficiently been
shown, when he saith, “and the spirit thereof hath not been trusted with God.”3579 For God
is right: and therefore by cleaving to the right, as to an immutable rule, the heart of a man
can be made right, which in itself was crooked.…
10. “And they forgat His benefits, and the wonderful works of Him which He showed
to them; before their fathers the wonderful things which He did” (ver. 11). What this is, is
not a question to be negligently passed over. Concerning those very fathers he was speaking
a little before, that they had been a generation crooked and embittering.…What fathers,

inasmuch as these are the very fathers, whom he would not have posterity to be like? If we
shall take them to be those out of whom the others had derived their being, for example,
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, by this time they had long since fallen asleep, when God showed
wonderful things in Egypt. For there followeth, “in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Thanis”
(ver. 12): where it is said that God showed to them wonderful things before their fathers.
Were they perchance present in spirit? For of the same the Lord saith in the Gospel, “for all
do live to Him.”3580 Or do we more suitably understand thereby the fathers Moses and
Aaron, and the other elders who are related in the same Scripture also to have received the
Spirit, of which also Moses received, in order that they might aid him in ruling and bearing
the same people?3581 For why should they not have been called fathers? It is not in the same
manner as God is the One Father, who doth regenerate with His Spirit those whom He doth
make sons for an everlasting inheritance; but it is for the sake of honour, because of their
age and kindly carefulness: just as Paul the elder saith, “Not to confound you I am writing
these things, but as my dearly beloved sons I am admonishing you:”3582 though he knew of
a truth that it had been said by the Lord, “Call ye no man your father on earth, for One is
your Father, even God.”3583 And this was not said in order that this term of human honour
should be erased from our usual way of speaking: but lest the grace of God whereby we are
regenerated unto eternal life, should be ascribed either to the power or even sanctity of any
man. Therefore when he said, “I have begotten you;” he first said, “in Christ,” and “through
the Gospel;” lest that might be thought to be of him, which is of God.…Accordingly, the
land of Egypt must be understood for a figure of this world. “The plain of Thanis” is the
smooth surface of lowly commandment. For lowly commandment is the interpretation of
Thanis. In this world therefore let us receive the commandment of humility, in order that
in another world we may merit to receive the exaltation which He hath promised, who for
our sake here became lowly.
11. For He that “did burst asunder the sea and made them go through, did confine the
waters as it were in bottles” (ver. 13), in order that the water might stand up first as if it were
shut in, is able by His grace to restrain the flowing and ebbing tides of carnal desires, when
we renounce this world, so that all sins having been thoroughly washed away, as if they were
enemies, the people of the faithful may be made to pass through by means of the Sacrament
of Baptism. He that “led them home in the cloud of the day, and in the whole of the night
in the illumination of fire” (ver. 14), is able also spiritually to direct goings if faith crieth to
3580 Luke xx. 38.
3581 Numb. xi. 17.
3582 1 Cor. iv. 14.
3583 Matt. xxiii. 9.
Psalm LXXVIII
Him, “Direct Thou my goings after Thy word.”3584 Of Whom in another place3585 is said,
“For Himself shall make thy courses right, and shall prolong thy goings in peace”3586 through
Jesus Christ our Lord, whose Sacrament in this world, as it were in the day, is manifest in
the flesh, as if in a cloud; but in the Judgment it will be manifest like as in a terror by night;
for then there will be a great tribulation of the world like as it were fire, and it shall shine
for the just and shall burn for the unjust. “He that burst asunder the rock in the desert, and
gave them water as in a great deep” (ver. 15); “and brought out water from the rock, and
brought down waters like rivers” (ver. 16), is surely able upon thirsty faith to pour the gift
of the Holy Spirit (the which gift the performance of that thing did spiritually signify), to
pour, I say, from the Spiritual Rock that followed, which is Christ: who did stand and cry,
“If any is athirst, let him come to Me:”3587 and, “he that shall have drunk of the water which
I shall give, rivers of living water shall flow out of his bosom.”3588 For this He spake, as is
read in the Gospel,3589 to the Spirit, which they were to receive that believed in Him, unto
whom like the rod drew near the wood of the Passion, in order that there might flow forth
grace for believers.
12. And yet, “they,” like a generation crooked and embittering, “added yet to sin against
Him” (ver. 17): that is, not to believe. For this is the sin, whereof the Spirit doth convict the
world, as the Lord saith, “Of sin indeed because they have not believed on Me.”3590 “And
they exasperated the Most High in drought,” which other copies have, “in a place without
water,” which is a more exact translation from the Greek, and doth signify no other thing
than drought. Was it in that drought of the desert, or rather in their own? For although they
had drank of the rock, they had not their bellies but their minds dry, freshening with no
fruitfulness of righteousness. In that drought they ought the more faithfully to have been
suppliant unto God, in order that He who had given fulness unto their jaws, might give also
equity to their manners. For unto him the faithful soul doth cry, “Let mine eyes see
equity.”3591
13. “And they tempted God in their hearts, in order that they might seek morsels for
their souls” (ver. 18). It is one thing to ask in believing, another thing in tempting. Lastly
3584 Ps. cxix. 133.
3585 Prov. iv. 27, LXX.
3586 These words are part of an addition in the Septuagint text.

Psalm LXXVIII
there followeth, “And they slandered God, and said, Shall God be able to prepare a table in
the desert?” (ver. 19). “For He smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and torrents gushed
forth: will He be able to give bread also, or to prepare a table for His people?” (ver. 20). Not
believing therefore, they sought morsels for their souls. Not so the Apostle James doth enjoin
a morsel to be asked for the mind, but doth admonish that it be sought by believers, not by
such as tempt and slander God. “But if any one of you,” he saith, “doth lack wisdom, let him
ask of God, who doth give to all men abundantly, and doth not upbraid, and it shall be given
to him: but let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.” 3592 This faith had not that generation
which “had not directed their heart, and the spirit thereof had not been trusted with God.”
14. “Wherefore the Lord heard, and He delayed, and fire was lighted in Jacob, and wrath
went up into Israel” (ver. 21). He hath explained what he hath called fire. He hath called
anger fire: although in strict propriety fire did also burn up many men. What is therefore
this that he saith, “The Lord heard, and He delayed”? Did He delay to conduct them into
the land of promise, whither they were being led: which might have been done in the space
of a few days, but on account of sins they must needs be wasted in the desert, where also
they were wasted during forty years? And if this be so, He did then delay the people, not
those very persons who tempted and slandered God: for they all perished in the desert, and
their children journeyed into the land of promise. Or did He delay punishment, in order
that He might first satisfy unbelieving concupiscence, lest He might be supposed to be angry,
because they were asking of Him what He was not able to do? “He heard,” then, “and He
delayed to avenge:” and after He had done what they supposed He was not able to do, then
“anger went up upon Israel.”
15. Lastly, when both these things have been briefly touched, afterwards he is evidently
following out the order of the narrative. “Because they believed not in God, nor hoped in
His saving health” (ver. 22). For when he had told why fire was lighted in Jacob, and anger
went up upon Israel, that is to say, “because they believed not in God, nor hoped in His
saving health:” immediately subjoining the evident blessings for which they were ungrateful,
he saith, “and He commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of Heaven” (ver. 23).
“And He rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them bread of Heaven” (ver. 24). “Bread
of angels man did eat: dainties He sent them in abundance” (ver. 25). He brought over the
South Wind from Heaven, and in His virtue He led in the South West Wind” (ver. 26). “And
He rained upon them fleshes like dust, and winged fowls like the sand of the sea” (ver. 27).
“And they fell in the midst of their camp, around their tabernacles” (ver. 28). “And they ate
and were filled exceedingly; and their desire He brought to them: they were not deprived
of their desire” (ver. 29). Behold why He had delayed. But what He had delayed let us hear.
“Yet the morsel was in their mouths, and the anger of God came down upon them” (ver.
3592 Jas. i. 5, 6.
Psalm LXXVIII
30). Behold what He had delayed. For before “He delayed:” and afterwards, “fire was lighted
in Jacob and anger went up upon Israel.” He had delayed therefore in order that He might
first do what they had believed that He could not do, and then might bring upon them what
they deserved to suffer. For if they placed their hope in God, not only would their desires
of the flesh but also those of the spirit have been fulfilled. For he that…“opened the doors
of Heaven, and rained upon them manna to eat,” that He might fill the unbelieving, is not
without power to give to believers Himself the true Bread from Heaven, which the manna
did signify: which is indeed the food of Angels, whom being incorruptible the Word of God
doth incorruptibly feed: the which in order that man might eat, He became flesh, and
dwelled in us. 3593 For Himself the Bread by means of the Evangelical clouds is being rained
over the whole world, and, the hearts of preachers like heavenly doors, being opened, is
being preached not to a murmuring and tempting synagogue, but to a Church believing
and putting hope in Him. He is able also to feed the feeble faith of such as tempt not, but
believe, with the signs of words uttered by the flesh and speeding through the air, as though
it were fowls: not however with such as come from the north, where cold and mist do prevail,
that is to say, eloquence which is pleasing to this world, but by bringing over the South Wind
from Heaven; whither, except to the earth? In order that they who are feeble in faith, by
hearing things earthly may be nourished up to receive things heavenly.…
16. But as to unbelievers, being a crooked and embittering generation, as it were, while
the morsel was yet in their mouths, “the anger of God went up upon them, and it slew among
the most of them” (ver. 31): that is, the most of them, or as some copies have it, “the fat ones
of them,” which however in the Greek copies which we had, we did not find. But if this be
the truer reading, what else must be understood by “the fat ones of them,” than men mighty
in pride, concerning whom is said, “their iniquity shall come forth as if out of fat”?3594 “And
the elect of Israel He fettered.” Even there there were elect, with whose faith the generation
crooked and embittering was not mixed. But they were fettered, so that they might in no
sort profit them for whom they desired that they might provide from a fatherly affection.
For what is conferred by human mercy, on those with whom God is angry? Or rather hath
He willed it to be understood, how that even the elect were fettered at the same time with
them, in order that they who were diverse both in mind and in life, might endure sufferings
with them for an example not only of righteousness, but also of patience? For we have
learned that holy men were even led captive with sinners for no other reason; since in the
Greek copies we read not ἐνεπόδισεν, which is “fettered;” but συνεπόδισεν, which is rather
“fettered together with.”
3593 John i. 44.
3594 Ps. lxxiii. 7.
Psalm LXXVIII
17. But the generation crooked and embittering, “in all these things sinned yet more,
and they believed not in His wonderful works” (ver. 32). “And in their days failed in vanity”
(ver. 33). Though they might, if they had believed, have had days in truth without failing,
with Him to whom hath been said, “Thy years shall not fail.”3595 Therefore, “their days
failed in vanity, and their years with haste.” For the whole life of mortal men is hastening,
and that which seemeth to be longer is but a vapour of somewhat longer duration.
18. Nevertheless, “when he slew them they sought Him:” not for the sake of eternal life,
but fearing to end the vapour too soon. There sought Him then, not indeed those whom
He had slain, but they that were afraid of being slain according to the example of them. But
the Scripture hath so spoken of them as if they sought God who were slain; because they
were one people, and it is spoken as if of one body: “and they returned, and at dawn they
came to God” (ver. 34). “And they remembered that God is their Helper, and the High God
is their Redeemer” (ver. 35). But all this is for the sake of acquiring temporal good things,
and for avoiding temporal evil things. For they that did seek God for the sake of temporal
blessings, sought not God indeed, but things. Thus with those God is worshipped with
slavish fear, not free love. Thus then God is not worshipped, for that thing is worshipped
which is loved. Whence because God is found to be greater and better than all things, He
must be loved more than all things, in order that He may be worshipped.
19. Lastly, here let us see the words following: “And they loved Him,” he saith, “in their
mouth, and in their tongue they lied unto Him” (ver. 36). “But their heart was not right
with Him, and they were not counted faithful in His Testament” (ver. 37). One thing on
their tongue, another thing in their heart He found, unto whom the secret things of men
are naked, and without any impediment He saw what they loved rather. Therefore the heart
is right with God, when it doth seek God for the sake of God. For one thing he desired of
the Lord, the same he will require, that he may dwell always in the House of the Lord, and
may meditate on the pleasantness of Him.3596 Unto Whom saith the heart of the faithful,
I will be filled, not with the flesh-pots of the Egyptians, nor with melons and gourds, and
garlick and onions, which a generation crooked and embittering did prefer even to bread
celestial,3597 nor with visible manna, and those same winged fowls; but, “I will be filled,
when Thy glory shall be made manifest.”3598 For this is the inheritance of the New Testament,
wherein they were not counted faithful; whereof however the faith even at that time, when
it was veiled, was in the elect, and now, when it hath already been revealed, it is not in many
that are called. “For many have been called, but few are elect.”3599 Of such sort therefore
3595 Ps. cii. 27.
3596 Ps. xxvii. 4.
3597 Exod. xvi. 3.
3598 Ps. xvii. 15, Lat.

Psalm LXXVIII
was the generation crooked and embittering, even when they were seeming to seek God,
loving in mouth, and in tongue lying; but in heart not right with God, while they loved
rather those things, for the sake of which they required the help of God.
20. “But He is Himself merciful, and will become propitious to their sins, and He will
not destroy them. And He will abound to turn away His anger, and He will not kindle all
his anger” (ver. 38). By these words many men promise to themselves impunity for their
iniquity from the Divine Mercy, even if they shall have persevered in being such, as that
generation is described, “crooked and embittering; which hath not directed their heart, and
the spirit thereof hath not been trusted with God:” with whom it is not profitable to agree.
For if, to speak in their words, God will perchance not destroy no not even bad men, without
doubt He will not destroy good men. Why then do we not rather choose that wherein there
is no doubt? For they that lie to Him in their tongue, though their heart doth hold some
other thing, do think indeed, and will, even God to be a liar, when He doth menace upon
such men eternal punishment. But whilst they do not deceive Him with their lying, He doth
not deceive them with speaking the truth. These words therefore of divine sayings, concerning
which the crooked generation doth cajole itself, let it not make crooked like its own heart:
for even when it is made crooked, they continue right. For at first they may be understood
according to that which is written in the Gospel, “that ye may be like your Father who is in
the Heavens, who maketh His sun to rise upon good men and evil men, and raineth upon
just men and unjust men.”3600 For who could not see, how great is the long-suffering of
mercy with which He is sparing evil men? But before the Judgment, He spared then that
nation in such sort, that He kindled not 3601all His anger, utterly to root it up and bring it
to an end: which thing in His words and in the intercession for their sins of His servant
Moses doth evidently appear, where God saith, “Let Me blot them out, and make thee into
a great nation:”3602 he intercedeth, being more ready to be blotted out for them than that
they should be; knowing that he is doing this before One Merciful, who inasmuch as by no
means He would blot out him, would even spare them for his sake. For let us see how greatly
He spared, and doth still spare.…
21. In the second place, that we may not seem to do violence to divine words, and lest
in the place where there was said, “He will not destroy them,”3603 we should say, “But
hereafter He will destroy them:” concerning this very present Psalm let us turn to a very
common phrase of the Scripture, whereby this question may be more diligently and more
truly solved. Speaking of these same persons a little lower down, when He had made mention
3600 Matt. v. 45.
3601 Many mss. omit “not.”
3602 Exod. xxxii. 10.
3603 Ps. lxxviii. 38.
Psalm LXXVIII
of the things which the Egyptians because of them had endured, He saith,…“And He led
them unto the mount of His sanctification, the mount which His right hand won. And He
cast out from their face the nations, and by lot distributed to them the land in the cord of
distribution.”3604 If any one at these words should press a question upon us, and should
say, How doth he make mention of all these things as having been bestowed upon them,
when the same persons were not led into the land of promise, as were delivered from Egypt,
inasmuch as they were dead? What shall we reply but that they were spoken of, because they
were the self-same people by means of a succession of sons?…
22. “And He remembered that they are flesh, a spirit3605 going and not returning” (ver.
39). Therefore calling them and pitying them through His grace, He called them back
Himself, because of themselves they could not return. For how doth flesh return, “a spirit
walking and not turning back,”3606 while a weight of evil deserts doth weigh it down unto
the lowest and far places of evil, save through the election of grace?…For thus also is solved
this no unimportant question, how it is written in the Proverbs, when the Scripture was
speaking of the way of iniquity, “all they that walk in her shall not return.”3607 For it hath
been so spoken as if all ungodly men were to be despaired of: but the Scripture did only
commend grace; for of himself man is able to walk in that way, but is not able of himself to
return, except when called back by grace.
23. I say then of these crooked and embittering persons, “How often they exasperated
Him in the desert, and provoked Him to wrath in the waterless place!” (ver. 40). “And they
turned themselves and tempted God, and exasperated the Holy One of Israel” (ver. 41). He
is repeating that same unbelief of theirs, of which He had made mention above. But the
reason of the repetition is, in order that there may be mentioned also the plagues which He
inflicted on the Egyptians for their sakes: all which things they certainly ought to have re-
membered, and not to be ungrateful. Lastly, there followeth what? “They remembered not
His hands, in the day when He redeemed them from the hand of the troubler” (ver. 42).
And he beginneth to speak of what things He did to the Egyptians: “He set in Egypt His
signs, and His prodigies in the plain of Thanis” (ver. 43): “and He turned their rivers into
blood, and their showers lest they should drink” (ver. 44), or rather, “the flowings of waters,”
as some do better understand by what is written in Greek, τὰ ὀμβρήματα, which in Latin
we call scaturigines, waters bubbling from beneath. “He sent upon them the dog-fly, and it
ate them up; and the frog, and it destroyed them” (ver. 45). “And He gave their fruit to the
mildew, and their labours to the locust” (ver. 46). “And He slew with hail their vineyards,
3604 Ps. lxxviii. 54, 55.
3605 Or, “breath.”
3606 [Transient, and not returning.—C.]

Psalm LXXVIII
and their mulberry trees with frost” (ver. 47). “And He gave over to the hail their beasts of
burden, and their possessions to the fire” (ver. 48). “He sent upon them the anger of His
indignation, indignation and anger and tribulation, a visitation through evil angels” (ver.
49). He made a way to the course of His anger, and their beasts of burden He shut up in
death (ver. 50). “And He smote every first-born thing in the land of Egypt, the first-fruits
of their labours in the tabernacles of Cham” (ver. 51).
24. All these punishments of the Egyptians may be explained by an allegorical interpret-
ation, according as one shall have chosen to understand them, and to compare them to the
things whereunto they must be referred. Which we too will endeavour to do; and shall do
it the more properly, the more we shall have been divinely aided. For to do this, those words
of this Psalm do constrain us, wherein it was said, “I will open in parables my mouth, I will
declare propositions from the beginning.”3608 For for this cause even some things have been
here spoken of, which that they befell the Egyptians at all we read not, although all their
plagues are most carefully related in Exodus according to their order, so that while that
which is not there mentioned we are sure hath not been mentioned in the Psalm to no
purpose, and we can interpret the same only figuratively, we may at the same time understand
that even the rest of the things which it is evident did happen, were done or described for
the sake of some figurative meaning. For the Scripture doth so do in many passages of the
prophetic sayings.…In the plagues therefore of the Egyptians, which are in the book which
is called Exodus, where the Scripture hath been especially careful, that those things whereby
they were afflicted should be all related in order, there is not found what this Psalm hath,
“and He gave to the mildew their fruits.” This also wherein, when he had said, “and He gave
over to the hail their beasts,” he hath added, “and their possession to the fire:” of the beasts
slain with hail is read in Exodus;3609 but how their possession was burned with fire, is not
read at all. Although voices and fires do come together with hail, just as thunderings do
commonly accompany lightnings; nevertheless, it is not written that anything was given
over to the fire that it should be burned. Lastly, the soft things which the hail could not hurt,
are said not to have been smitten, that is, hurt with hard blows; which things the locust de-
voured afterwards. Also that which is here spoken of, “and their mulberry trees with hoar-
frost,” is not in Exodus. For hoar-frost doth differ much from hail; for in the clear winter
nights the earth is made white with hoar-frost.
25. What then those things do signify, let the interpreter say as he can, let reader and
hearer judge as is just. The water turned into blood seemeth to me to signify a carnal view
of the causes of things. Dog-fly, are the manners of dogs,3610 who see not even their parents
3608 Ps. lxxviii. 2.
3609 Exod. ix. 25.
3610 [Obscenique canes. Virg. Georg. i. 470.—C.]
Psalm LXXVIII
when first they are born. The frog is very talkative vanity. Mildew doth hurt secretly, which
also some have interpreted by rust, others black mould: which evil thing to what vice is it
more appropriately compared, than to what doth show itself least readily, like the trusting
much in one’s self? For it is a blighting air which doth work this secretly among fruits: just
like in morals, secret pride, when a man thinketh himself to be something, though he is
nothing.3611 The locust is malice hurting with the mouth, that is, with unfaithful testimony.
The hail is iniquity taking away the goods of others; whence theft, robberies, and depredations
do spring: but more by his wickedness the plunderer himself is plundered. The hoar-frost
doth signify the fault wherein the love of one’s neighbour by the darkness of foolishness,
like as it were by the cold of night, is frozen up. But the fire, if here it is not that which is
mentioned which was in the hail out of the lightning clouds, forasmuch as he hath said here,
“He gave over their possession to the fire,” where he implieth that a thing was burned, which
by that fire we read not to have been done,—it seemeth to me, I say, to signify the savageness
of wrath, whereby even man-slaying may be committed. But by the death of beasts was
figured, as far as I judge, the loss of chastity. For concupiscence, whereby offspring do arise,
we have in common with beasts. To have this therefore tamed and ordered, is the virtue of
chastity. The death of the first-born things, is the putting off of the very justice whereby a
man doth associate with mankind. But whether the figurative significations of these things
be so, or whether they are better understood in another way, whom would it not move, that
with ten plagues the Egyptians are smitten, and with ten commandments the tables are in-
scribed,3612 that thereby the people of God should be ruled? Concerning the comparing of
which one with the other, inasmuch as we have spoken elsewhere, there is no need to load
the exposition of this Psalm therewith: thus much we remind you, that here too, though not
in the same order, yet ten plagues of the Egyptians are commemorated, forasmuch as in the
place of three which are in Exodus and are not here, to wit, lice, boils, darkness; other three
are commemorated, which are not there, that is to say, mildew, hoarfrost, and fire; not of
lightning, but that where-unto their possession was given over, which is not read of in that
place.
26. But it hath been clearly enough intimated, that by the judgment of God these things
befell them through the instrumentality of evil angels, in this wicked world, as though it
were in Egypt and in the plain of Thanis, where we ought to be humble, until there come
that world, wherein we may earn to be exalted out of this humiliation. For even Egypt in
the Hebrew tongue doth signify darkness or tribulations, in which tongue, Thanis, 3613 as
I have observed, is understood to be humble commandment. Concerning the evil angels

therefore in this Psalm, while he was speaking of those very plagues, there hath been some-
thing inserted, which must not be passed over cursorily: “He sent upon them,” he saith, “an
infliction through evil angels.” Now that the devil and his angels are so very evil, that for
them everlasting fire is prepared, no believer is ignorant: but that there should be sent by
means of them an infliction from the Lord God upon certain whom He judgeth to be de-
serving of this punishment, seemeth to be a hard thing to those who are little prone to
consider, how the perfect justice of God doth use well even evil things. For these indeed, as
far as regardeth their substance, what other person but Himself hath made? But evil He hath
not made them: yet He doth use them, inasmuch as He is good, well, that is, conveniently
and justly: just as on the other hand unrighteous men do use His good creatures in evil
manner. God therefore doth use evil angels not only to punish evil men, as in the case of all
those concerning whom the Psalm doth speak, as in the case of king Achab, whom a spirit
of lying by the will of God did beguile, in order that he might fall in war:3614 but also to
prove and make manifest good men, as He did in the case of Job. But as far as regardeth
that corporal matter of visible elements, I suppose that thereof angels both good and evil
are able to make use, according to the power given to each: just as also men good and evil
do use such things, as far as they are able, according to the measure of human infirmity. For
we use both earth and water, and air, and fire, not only in things necessary for our support,
but also in many operations superfluous and playful, and marvellously artificial. For
countless things, which are called μηχανήματα, are moulded out of these elements scientific-
ally employed. But over these things angels have a far more extended power, both the good
and the evil, though greater is that which the good have;3615 but only so far as is commanded
or permitted by the will and providence of God; on which terms also we have it. For not
even in these cases are we able to do all that we will. But in a book the most unerring we
read that the devil was able even to send fire from Heaven, to burn up with wonderful and
awful fierceness so great a number of the cattle of a holy man:3616 which thing no one of
the faithful would dare perchance to ascribe to the devil, except it were read on the authority
of Holy Scripture. But that man, being by the gift of God just and firm, and of godly know-
ledge, saith not, The Lord hath given, the devil hath taken away: but, “The Lord hath given,
the Lord hath taken away:”3617 very well knowing that even what the devil was able to do
with these elements, he would still not have done to a servant of God, except at his Lord’s
will and permission; he did confound the malice of the devil, forasmuch as he knew who it
was that was making use thereof to prove him. In the sons then of unbelief like as it were

Psalm LXXVIII
in his own slaves, he doth work,3618 like men with their beasts, and even therewith only so
far as is permitted by the just judgment of God. But it is one thing when his power is re-
strained from treating even his own as he pleases, by a greater power; another thing when
to him power is given even over those who are alien from him. Just as a man with his beast,
as men understand it, doeth what he will, and yet doth not indeed, if he be restrained by a
greater power: but with another man’s beast to do something, he doth wait until power be
given from him unto whom it belongeth. In the former case the power which there was is
restrained, in the latter that which there was not is conceded.
27. And if such be the case, if through evil angels God did inflict those plagues upon
the Egyptians, shall we dare to say that the water also was turned into blood by means of
those same angels, and that frogs were created by means of the same, the like whereunto
even the magicians of Pharaoh were able to make by their enchantments;3619 so as that evil
angels stood on both sides, on the one side afflicting them, on the other side deceiving them,
according to the judgment and dispensation3620 of the most just and most omnipotent God,
who doth justly make use of even the naughtiness of unrighteous men? I dare not to say so.
For whence was it that the magicians of Pharaoh could by no means make lice?3621 Was it
not because even these same evil angels were not suffered to do this? Or, to speak more
truly, is not the cause hidden, and it doth exceed our powers of inquiry? For if we shall have
supposed that God wrought those things by means of evil angels, because punishments were
being inflicted, and not blessings being bestowed, as though God doth inflict punishments
upon no one by means of good angels, but by means of those executioners as it were of the
heavenly wrath; the consequence will be that we must believe that even Sodom was over-
thrown by means of evil angels, and that Abraham and Lot would seem to have entertained
under their roof evil angels;3622 the which, as being contrary to the most evident Scriptures,
far be it that we should think. It is clear then that these things might have been done to men
by means of good and evil angels. What should be done or when it should be done doth
escape me: but Him that doeth it, it escapeth not, and him unto whom He shall have willed
to reveal it. Nevertheless, as far as divine Scripture doth yield to our application thereto, on
evil men that punishments are inflicted both by means of good angels, as upon the Sodomites,
and by means of evil angels, as upon the Egyptians, we read: but that just men with corporal
penances by means of good angels are tried and proved, doth not occur to me.

Psalm LXXVIII
28. But as far as regardeth the present passage of this Psalm, if we dare not ascribe those
things which were marvellously formed out of creatures, to evil angels; we have a thing
which without doubt we can ascribe to them; the dyings of the beasts, the dyings of the first-
born, and this especially whence all these things proceeded, namely, the hardening of heart,
so that they would not let go the people of God.3623 For when God is said to make this most
iniquitous and malignant obstinacy, He maketh it not by suggesting and inspiring, but by
forsaking, so that they work in the sons of unbelief that which God doth duly and justly
permit.3624…Moreover, those evil manners which we said were signified by these corporal
plagues, on account of that which was said before, “I will open in parables my mouth,”3625
are most appropriately believed by means of evil angels to have been wrought in those that
are made subject to them by Divine justice. For neither when that cometh to pass of which
the apostle speaketh, “God gave them over into the lusts of their heart, that they should do
things which are not convenient,”3626 can it be but that those evil angels dwell and rejoice
therein, as in the matter of their own work: unto whom most justly is human haughtiness
made subject, in all save those whom grace doth deliver. “And for these things who is suffi-
cient?”3627 Whence when he had said, “He sent unto them the anger of His indignation,
indignation and anger and tribulation, an infliction through evil angels;” for this which he
hath added, “a way He hath made for the path of His anger” (ver. 50), whose eye, I pray, is
sufficient to penetrate, so that it may understand and take in the sense lying hidden in so
great a profundity? For the path of the anger of God was that whereby He punished the
ungodliness of the Egyptians with hidden justice: but for that same path He made a way, so
that drawing them forth as it were from secret places by means of evil angels unto manifest
offences, He most evidently inflicted punishment upon those that were most evidently un-
godly. From this power of evil angels nothing doth deliver man but the grace of God,
whereof the Apostle speaketh, “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and
hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love:”3628 of which things that people
did bear the figure, when they were delivered from the power of the Egyptians, and translated
into the kingdom of the land of promise flowing with milk and honey, which doth signify
the sweetness of grace.
29. The Psalm proceedeth then after the commemoration of the plagues of the Egyptians
(ver. 51) and saith, “And He took away like sheep His people, and He led them through like

a flock in the desert” (ver. 52). “And He led them down in hope, and they feared not, and
their enemies the sea covered” (ver. 53). This cometh to pass to so much the greater good,
as it is a more inward thing, wherein being delivered from the power of darkness, we are in
mind translated into the Kingdom of God, and with respect to spiritual pastures we are
made to become sheep of God, walking in this world as it were in a desert, inasmuch as to
no one is our faith observable: whence saith the Apostle, “Your life is hidden with Christ in
God.”3629 But we are being led home in hope, “For by hope we are saved.”3630 Nor ought
we to fear. For, “If God be for us, who can be against us?”3631 And our enemies the sea hath
covered, He hath effaced them in baptism by the remission of sins.
30. In the next place there followeth, “And He led them into the mountain of His sanc-
tification” (ver. 54). How much better into Holy Church! “The mountain which His right
hand hath gotten.” How much higher is the Church which Christ hath gotten, concerning
whom has been said, “And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”3632 (ver. 55).
“And He cast forth from the face of them the nations.” And3633 from the face of His faithful.
For nations in a manner are the evil spirits of Gentile errors. “And by lot He divided unto
them the land in the cord of distribution.” And in us “all things one and the same Spirit
doth work, dividing severally to every one as He willeth.”3634
31. “And He made to dwell in their tabernacles the tribes of Israel.” In the tabernacles,
he saith, of the Gentiles He made the tribes of Israel to dwell, which I think can better be
explained spiritually, inasmuch as unto celestial glory, whence sinning angels have been
cast forth and cast down, by Christ’s grace we are being uplifted. For that generation crooked
and embittering, inasmuch as for these corporal blessings they put not off the coat of oldness,
“Did tempt” yet, “and provoked the high God, and His testimonies they kept not (ver. 56):
and they turned them away, and they kept not the covenant, like their fathers” (ver. 57). For
under a sort of covenant and decree they said, “All things which our Lord God hath spoken
we will do, and we will hear.”3635 It is a remarkable thing indeed which he saith, “like their
fathers:” while throughout the whole text of the Psalm he was seeming to speak of the same
men as it were, yet now it appeareth that the words did concern those who were already in
the land of promise, and that the fathers spoken of were of those who did provoke in the
desert. “They were turned,” he saith, “into a crooked,” or, as some copies have it, “into a

perverse bow” (ver. 58). But what this is doth better appear in that which followeth, where
he saith, “And unto wrath they provoked Him with their hills” (ver. 59). It doth signify that
they leaped into idolatry. The bow then was perverted, not for the name of the Lord, but
against the name of the Lord: who said to the same people, “Thou shalt have none other
Gods but Me.”3636 But by the bow He doth signify the mind’s intention. This same idea,
lastly, more clearly working out, “And in their graven idols,” he saith, “they provoked Him
to indignation.”
32. “God heard, and He despised:” that is, He gave heed and took vengeance. “And unto
nothing He brought Israel exceedingly” (ver. 60). For when God despised, what were they
who by God’s help were what they were? But doubtless he is commemorating the doing of
that thing, when they were conquered by the Philistines in the time of Heli the priest, and
the Ark of the Lord was taken, and with great slaughter they were laid low.3637 This it is
that he speaketh of. “And He rejected the tabernacle of Selom, His tabernacle, where He
dwelled among men” (ver. 61). He hath elegantly explained why He rejected His tabernacle,
when he saith, “where He dwelled among men.” When therefore they were not worthy for
Him to dwell among, why should He not reject the tabernacle, which indeed not for Himself
He had established, but for their sakes, whom now He judged unworthy for Him to dwell
among. “And He gave over unto captivity their strength, and their beauty unto the hands
of the enemy.” The very Ark whereby they thought themselves invincible, and whereon they
plumed themselves, he calleth their “virtue” and “beauty.” Lastly, also afterward, when they
were living ill, and boasting of the temple of the Lord, He doth terrify them by a Prophet,
saying, “See ye what I have done to Selom, where was My tabernacle.” 3638 “And He ended
with the sword His people, and His inheritance He despised” (ver. 62). “Their young men
the fire devoured:” that is, wrath. “And their virgins mourned not” (ver. 63). For not even
for this was there leisure, in fear of the foe. “Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows
were not lamented” (ver. 64). For there fell by the sword the sons of Heli, of one of whom
the wife being widowed, and presently dying in child-birth,3639 because of the same confusion
could not be mourned with the distinction of a funeral. “And the Lord was awakened as
one sleeping” (ver. 65). For He seemeth to sleep, when He giveth His people into the hands
of those whom He hateth, when there is said to them, “Where is thy God?”3640 “He was
awakened, then, like one sleeping, like a mighty man drunken with wine.” No one would
dare to say this of God, save His Spirit. For he hath spoken, as it seemeth to ungodly men

reviling; as if like a drunken man He sleepeth long, when He succoureth not so speedily as
men think.3641
33. “And He smote His enemies in the hinder parts” (ver. 66): those, to wit, who were
rejoicing that they were able to take His Ark: for they were smitten in their back-parts.3642
Which seemeth to me to be a sign of that punishment, wherewith a man will be tortured, if
he shall have looked back upon things behind; which, as saith the Apostle, he ought to value
as dung.3643 For they that do so receive the Testament of God, as that they put not off from
them the old vanity, are like the hostile nations, who did place the captured Ark of the
Testament beside their own idols. And yet those old things even though these be unwilling
do fall: for “all flesh is hay, and the glory of man as the flower of hay. The hay hath dried
up, and the flower hath fallen off:”3644 but the Ark of the Lord “abideth for everlasting,” to
wit, the secret testament of the kingdom of Heaven, where is the eternal Word of God. But
they that have loved things behind, because of these very things most justly shall be tormen-
ted. For “everlasting reproach He hath given to them.” (ver. 67).
34. “And He rejected,” he saith, “the tabernacle of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim3645
He chose not” (ver. 68). “And He chose the tribe of Judah” (ver. 69). He hath not said, He
rejected the tabernacle of Reuben, who was the first-born son of Jacob;3646 nor them that
follow, and precede Judah in order of birth; so that they being rejected and not chosen, the
tribe of Judah was chosen. For it might have been said that they were deservedly rejected;
because even in the blessing of Jacob wherewith he blessed his sons, he mentioneth their
sins,3647 and deeply abhorreth them; though among them the tribe of Levi merited to be
the priestly tribe, whence also Moses was.3648 Nor hath he said, He rejected the tabernacle
of Benjamin, or the tribe of Benjamin He chose not, out of which a king already had begun
to be; for thence there had been chosen Saul;3649 whence because of the very proximity of

the time, when he had been rejected and refused, and David chosen,3650 this might conveni-
ently have been said; but yet was not said: but he hath named those especially who seemed
to excel for more surpassing merits. For Joseph fed in Egypt his father and his brethren, and
having been impiously sold, because of his piety, chastity, wisdom, he was most justly exal-
ted;3651 and Ephraim by the blessing of his grandfather Jacob was preferred before his elder
brother:3652 and yet God “rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim He
chose not.” In which place by these names of renowned merit, what else do we understand
but that whole people with old cupidity requiring of the Lord earthly rewards, rejected and
refused, but the tribe of Judah chosen not for the sake of the merits of that same Judah? For
far greater are the merits of Joseph, but by the tribe of Judah, inasmuch as thence arose
Christ according to the flesh, the Scripture doth testify of the new people of Christ preferred
before that old people, the Lord opening in parables His mouth. Moreover, thence also in
that which followeth, “the Mount Sion which He chose,” we do better understand the Church
of Christ, not worshipping God for the sake of the carnal blessings of the present time, but
from afar looking for future and eternal rewards with the eyes of faith: for Sion too is inter-
preted a “looking out.”
35. Lastly there followeth, “and He builded like as of unicorns His sanctification” (ver.
70): or, as some interpreters have made thereof a new word, “His sanctifying.”3653 The
unicorns are rightly understood to be those, whose firm hope is uplifted unto that one thing,
concerning which another Psalm saith, “One thing I have sought of the Lord, this I will re-
quire.”3654 But the sanctifying of God, according to the Apostle Peter, is understood to be
a holy people and a royal priesthood.3655 But that which followeth, “in the land which He
founded for everlasting:” which the Greek copies have εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, whether it be called
by us “for everlasting,” or “for an age,” is at the pleasure of the Latin translators; forasmuch
as it doth signify either: and therefore the latter is found in some Latin copies, the former
in others. Some also have it in the plural, that is, “for ages:” which in the Greek copies which
we have had we have not found. But which of the faithful would doubt, that the Church,
even though, some going, others coming, she doth pass out of this life in mortal manner, is
yet founded for everlasting?
36. “And He chose David His servant” (ver. 71). The tribe, I say, of Judah, for the sake
of David: but David for the sake of Christ: the tribe then of Judah for the sake of Christ. At

Psalm LXXVIII
whose passing by blind men cried out, “Have pity on us, Son of David:”3656 and forthwith
by His pity they received light, because true was the thing which they cried out. This then
the Apostle doth not cursorily speak of, but doth heedfully notice, writing to Timothy, “Be
thou mindful, that Christ Jesus hath risen from the dead, of the seed of David,” etc.3657
Therefore the Saviour Himself, made according to the flesh of the seed of David, is figured
in this passage under the name of David, the Lord opening in parables His mouth. And let
it not move us, that when he had said, “and He chose David,” under which name he signified
Christ, he hath added, “His servant,” not His Son. Yea even hence we may perceive, that
not the substance of the Only-Begotten coeternal with the Father, but the “form of a servant”
was taken of the seed of David.
37. “And He took him from the flocks of sheep, from behind the teeming sheep He re-
ceived him: to feed Jacob His servant, and Israel His inheritance” (ver. 72). This David indeed,
of whose seed the flesh of Christ is, from the pastoral care of cattle was translated to the
kingdom of men: but our David, Jesus Himself, from men to men, from Jews to Gentiles,
was yet according to the parable from sheep to sheep taken away and translated. For there
are not now in that land “Churches of Judæa in Christ,” which belonged to them of the
circumcision after the recent Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, of whom saith the
Apostle, “But I was unknown by face to the Churches of Judæa, which are in Christ,” etc.3658
Already from hence those Churches of the circumcised people have passed away: and thus
in Judæa, which now doth exist on the earth, there is not now Christ.3659 He hath been re-
moved thence, now He doth feed flocks of Gentiles. Truly from behind teeming sheep He
hath been taken thence. For those former Churches were of such sort, as that of them it is
said in the Song of Songs, “Thy teeth—are like a flock of shorn ewes going up from the
washing,3660 all of which do bear twins, and a barren one is not among them.”3661 For they
then laid aside like as it were fleeces the burdens of the world,3662 when before the feet of
the Apostles they laid the prices of their sold goods,3663 going up from that Laver, concerning

which the apostle Peter doth admonish them, when they were troubled because they had
shed the blood of Christ, and he saith, “Repent ye, and let each one of you be baptized in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and your sins shall be forgiven you.”3664 But twins they
begat, the works, to wit, of the two commandments of twin love, love of God, and love of
one’s neighbour: whence a barren one there was not among them. From behind these
teeming sheep our David having been taken, doth now feed other flocks among the Gentiles,
and those too “Jacob” and “Israel.” For thus hath been said, “to feed Jacob His servant, and
Israel His inheritance.”…Unless perchance any one be willing to make such a distinction
as this; viz. that in this time Jacob serveth; but he will be the eternal inheritance of God, at
that time when he shall see God face to face, whence he hath received the name Israel.3665
38. “And He fed them,” he saith, “in the innocence of His heart” (ver. 73). What can be
more innocent than He, who not only had not any sin whereby to be conquered, but even
not any to conquer? “And in the understanding of His hands He led them home:” or, as
some copies have it, “in the understandings of His hands.” Any other man might suppose
that it would have been better had it been said thus, “in innocence of hands and understand-
ing of heart;” but He who knew better than others what He spake, preferred to join with the
heart innocence, and with the hands understanding. It is for this reason, as far as I judge;
because many men think themselves innocent, who do not evil things because they fear lest
they should suffer if they shall have done them; but they have the will to do them, if they
could with impunity. Such men may seem to have innocence of hands, but yet not that of
heart. And what, I pray, or of what sort is that innocence, if of heart it is not, where man
was made after the image of God?3666 But in this which he saith, “in understanding (or in-
telligence) of His hands He led them home,” he seemeth to me to have spoken of that intel-
ligence which He doth Himself make in believers: and so “of His hands:” for making doth
belong to the hands, but in the sense wherein the hands of God may be understood; for even
Christ was a Man in such sort, that He was also God.…

Psalm LXXVIII
Psalm LXXIX.3667
1. Over the title of this Psalm, being so short and so simple, I think we need not tarry.
But the prophecy which here we read sent before, we know to be evidently fulfilled. For
when these things were being sung in the times of King David, nothing of such sort, by the
hostility of the Gentiles, as yet had befallen the city Jerusalem, nor the Temple of God, which
as yet was not even builded. For that after the death of David his son Salomon made a temple
to God, who is ignorant? That is spoken of therefore as though past, which in the Spirit was
seen to be future.
“O God, the Gentiles have come into Thine inheritance” (ver. 1). Under which form of
expression other things which were to come to pass, are spoken of as having been done.
Nor must this be wondered at, that these words are being spoken to God. For they are not
being represented to Him not knowing, by whose revelation they are foreknown; but the
soul is speaking with God with that affection of godliness, of which God knoweth.3668 For
even the things which Angels proclaim to men, they proclaim to them that know them not;
but the things which they proclaim to God, they proclaim to Him knowing, when they offer
our prayers, and in ineffable manner consult the eternal Truth respecting their actions, as
an immutable law. And therefore this man of God is saying to God that which he is to learn
of God, like a scholar to a master, not ignorant but judging; and so either approving what
he hath taught, or censuring what he hath not taught: especially because under the appearance
of one praying, the Prophet is transforming into himself those who should be at the time
when these things were to come to pass.3669 But in praying it is customary to declare those
things to God which He hath done in taking vengeance, and for a petition to be added, that
henceforth He should pity and spare. In this way here also by him the judgments are spoken
of by whom they are foretold, as if they were being spoken of by those whom they befell,
and the very lamentation and prayer is a prophecy.
2. “They have defiled Thy holy Temple, they have made Jerusalem for a keeping of
apples.” “They have made the dead bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls of heaven,
the fleshes of Thy saints for the beasts of the earth” (ver. 2). “They have poured forth their
blood like water in the circuit of Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them” (ver. 3). If
in this prophecy any one of us shall have thought that there must be understood that laying
waste of Jerusalem, which was made by Titus the Roman Emperor, when already the Lord

Psalm LXXIX
Psalm LXXIX
Jesus Christ, after His Resurrection and Ascension, was being preached among the Gentiles,
it doth not occur to me how that people could now have been called the inheritance of God,
as not holding to Christ, whom having rejected and slain, that people became reprobate,
which not even after His Resurrection would believe in Him, and even killed His Martyrs.
For out of that people Israel whosoever have believed in Christ; to whom the offer of Christ
was made, and in a manner the healthful and fruitful fulfilment of the promise; concerning
whom even the Lord Himself saith, “I am not sent but to the sheep which have been lost of
the house of Israel,”3670 the same are they that out of them are the sons of promise; the same
are counted for a seed;3671 the same do belong to the inheritance of God. From hence are
Joseph that just man, and the Virgin Mary who bore Christ:3672 hence John Baptist the
friend of the Bridegroom, and his parents Zacharias and Elisabeth:3673 hence Symeon the
old,3674 and Anna the widow, who heard not Christ speaking by the sense of the body; but
while yet an infant not speaking, by the Spirit perceived Him: hence the blessed Apostles:
hence Nathanael, in whom guile was not:3675 hence the other Joseph, who himself too looked
for the kingdom of God:3676 hence that so great multitude who went before and followed
after His beast, saying, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord:”3677 among
whom was also that company of children, in whom He declared to have been fulfilled, “Out
of the mouth of infants and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise.”3678 Hence also were
those after His resurrection, of whom on one day three and on another five thousand were
baptized,3679 welded into one soul and one heart by the fire of love; of whom no one spoke
of anything as his own, but to them all things were common.3680 Hence the holy deacons,
of whom Stephen was crowned with martyrdom before the Apostles.3681 Hence so many
Churches of Judæa, which were in Christ, unto whom Paul was unknown by face,3682 but
known for an infamous ferocity, and more known for Christ’s most merciful grace. Hence

even he, according to the prophecy sent before concerning him, “a wolf ravening, in the
morning carrying off, and in the evening dividing morsels;”3683 that is, first as persecutor
carrying off unto death, afterwards as a preacher feeding unto life. These are they that are
out of that people the inheritance of God.…So then even at this time a remnant through
election of Grace have been saved. This remnant out of that nation doth belong to the inher-
itance3684 of God: not those concerning whom a little below he saith, “But the rest have
been blinded.” For thus he saith. “What then? That which Israel sought, this he hath not
obtained: but the election hath obtained it: but the rest have been blinded.”3685 This election
then, this remnant, that people of God, which God hath not cast off, is called His inheritance.
But in that Israel, which hath not obtained this, in the rest that were blinded, there was no
longer an inheritance of God, in reference to whom it is possible that there should be spoken,
after the glorification of Christ in the Heavens, in the time of Titus the Emperor, “O God,
there have come the Gentiles unto Thine inheritance,” and the other things which in this
Psalm seem to have been foretold concerning the destruction of both the temple and city
belonging to that people.
3. Furthermore herein we ought either to perceive those things which were done by
other enemies, before Christ had come in the flesh: at that time when there were even the
holy prophets, when the carrying away into Babylon took place,3686 and that nation was
grievously afflicted, and at the time when under Antiochus also the Maccabees, having en-
dured horrible sufferings, were most gloriously crowned.3687 Or certainly if after the Resur-
rection and Ascension of the Lord the inheritance of God must be understood to be here
spoken of; such things must be understood herein, as at the hands of worshippers of idols,
and enemies of the name of Christ, His Church, in such a multitude of martyrs, en-
dured.…This Church then, this inheritance of God, out of circumcision and uncircumcision
hath been congregated, that is, out of the people of Israel, and out of the rest of the nations,
by means of the Stone which the builders rejected, and which hath become for the Head of
the corner,3688 in which corner as it were two walls coming from different quarters were
united. “For Himself is our peace, who hath made both one, that He might build two into
Himself, making peace, and might unite together3689 both in one Body unto God:3690 in

4. But now in that which followeth, “they have made Jerusalem for a keeping of apples;”
even the Church herself is rightly understood under this name, even the free Jerusalem our
mother,3692 concerning whom hath been written, “many more are the sons of the forsaken,
than of her that hath the husband.”3693 The expression, “for a keeping of apples,” I think
must be understood of the desertion which the wasting of persecution hath effected: that
is, like a keeping of apples; for the keeping of apples is abandoned, when the apples have
passed away. And certes when through the persecuting Gentiles the Church seemed to be
forsaken, unto the celestial table, like as it were many and exceeding sweet apples from the
garden of the Lord, the spirits of the martyrs did pass away.
5. “They have made,” he saith, “the dead bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls
of heaven, the fleshes of Thy saints for the beasts of the earth” (ver. 2). The expression, “dead
bodies,” hath been repeated in “fleshes:” and the expression, “of Thy servants,” hath been
repeated in, “of Thy saints.” This only hath been varied, “to the fowls of heaven, and to the
beasts of the earth.” Better have they interpreted who have written “dead,” than as some
have it, “mortal.” For “dead” is only said of those that have died; but mortal is a term applied
even to living bodies. When then, as I have said, to their Husbandman the spirits of martyrs
like apples had passed away, their dead bodies and their fleshes they set before the fowls of
heaven and the beasts of the earth: as if any part of them could be lost to the resurrection,
whereas out of the hidden recesses of the natural world He will renew the whole, by whom
even our hairs have been numbered.3694
6. “They have poured forth their blood like water,” that is, abundantly and wantonly,
“in the circuit of Jerusalem” (ver. 3). If we herein understand the earthly city Jerusalem, we
perceive the shedding of their blood in the circuit thereof, whom the enemy could find
outside the walls. But if we understand it of that Jerusalem, concerning whom hath been
said, “many more are the sons of her that was forsaken, than of her that hath the hus-
band,”3695 the circuit thereof is throughout the universal earth. For in that lesson of the
Prophet, wherein is written, “many more are the sons of her that was forsaken, than of her
that hath the husband:” a little after unto the same is said, “and He that hath delivered thee,
shall be called the God of Israel of the universal earth.”3696 The circuit then of this Jerusalem

Psalm LXXIX
in this Psalm must be understood as followeth: so far as at that time the Church had been
expanded, bearing fruit, and growing in the universal world, when in every part thereof
persecution was raging, and was making havoc of the Martyrs, whose blood was being shed
like water, to the great gain of the celestial treasuries. But as to that which hath been added,
“and there was no one to bury:” it either ought not to seem to be an incredible thing that
there should have been so great a panic in some places, that not any buriers at all of holy
bodies came forward: or certes that unburied corpses in many places might lie long time,
until being by the religious in a manner stolen3697 they were buried.
7. “We have become,” he saith, “a reproach to our neighbours” (ver. 4). Therefore pre-
cious not in the sight of men, from whom this reproach was, but “precious3698 in the sight
of the Lord is the death of His saints.”3699 “A scoffing and derision:” or, as some have inter-
preted it, “a mockery to them that are in our circuit.” It is a repetition of the former sentence.
For that which above hath been called, “a reproach,” the same hath been repeated in, “a
scoffing and derision:” and that which above hath been said in, “to our neighbours,” the
same hath been repeated in, “to them that are in our circuit.” Moreover, in reference to the
earthly Jerusalem, the neighbours, and those in the circuit of that nation, are certainly un-
derstood to be other nations. But in reference to the free Jerusalem our mother,3700 there
are neighbours even in the circuit of her, among whom, being her enemies, the Church
dwelleth in the circuit of the round world.
8. In the second place now giving utterance to an evident prayer, whence it may be
perceived that the calling to remembrance of former affliction is not by way of information
but prayer; “How long,” he saith, “O Lord, wilt Thou be angry, unto the end? shall Thy
jealousy burn like fire?” (ver. 5). He is evidently asking God not to be angry unto the end,
that is, that this so great oppression and tribulation and devastation may not continue even
unto the end; but that He moderate His chastening, according to that which is said in another
Psalm, “Thou shalt feed us with the bread of tears, and Thou shalt give us to drink of tears
in measure.”3701 For the, “how long, O Lord, wilt Thou be angry, unto the end?” hath been
spoken in the same sense as if it had been said, Be not, O Lord, angry unto the end. And in
that which followeth, “shall Thy jealousy burn like fire?” both words must be understood,
both, “how long,” and, “unto the end:” just as if there had been said, how long shall there
burn like fire Thy jealousy unto the end? For these two words must be understood in the
same manner as that word which was used a little higher up, namely, “they have made.” For
3697 [“With a pious sacrilege a grave I stole,” Dr. Young.—C.]
3698 Oxf. mss. rep. “precious.”
3699 Ps. cxvi. 15.
3700 Gal. iv. 26.
3701 Ps. lxxx. 5.
Psalm LXXIX
while the former sentence hath, “they have made the dead bodies of Thy servants morsels
for the fowls of heaven:”3702 this word the latter sentence hath not, wherein is said, “the
fleshes of Thy saints for the beasts of the earth;” but there is surely understood what the
former hath, namely, “they have made.”
Moreover, the anger and jealousy of God3703 are not emotions of God; as some do
charge upon the Scriptures which they do not understand:3704 but under the name of anger
is to be understood the avenging of iniquity; under the name of jealousy, the exaction of
chastity; that the soul may not despise the law of her Lord, and perish by departing in for-
nication from the Lord. These then in their actual operation in men’s affliction are violent;
but in the disposal of God they are calm, unto whom hath been said, “But Thou, O Lord of
virtues, with calmness dost judge.”3705 But it is clearly enough shown by these words, that
for sins these tribulations do befall men, though they be faithful: although hence may bloom
the Martyrs’ glory by occasion of their patience, and the yoke of discipline godly endured
as the scourge of the Lord. Of this the Maccabees amid sharp tortures,3706 of this the three
men amid flames innocuous,3707 of this the holy Prophets in captivity, do testify. For although
paternal correction most bravely and most godly they endure, yet they do not hide the fact,
that these things have befallen them for the deservings of their sins.3708…
9. But that which he addeth, “Pour forth Thine anger upon the nations which have not
known Thee, and upon the kingdoms which have not called upon Thy name” (ver. 6); this
too is a prophecy, not a wish. Not in the imprecation of malevolence are these words spoken,
but foreseen by the Spirit they are predicted: just as in the case of Judas the traitor, the evil
things which were to befall him have been so prophesied as if they were wished. For in like
manner as the prophet doth not command Christ, though in the imperative mood he giveth
utterance to what he saith, “Gird Thou Thy sword about Thy thigh, O Most Mighty: in Thy
beauty and in Thy goodliness, both go on, and prosperously proceed, and reign:”3709 so he
doth not wish, but doth prophesy, who saith, “Pour forth Thine anger upon the nations
which have not known Thee.” Which in his usual way he repeateth, saying, “And upon the
kingdoms which have not called upon Thy name.” For nations have been repeated in king-
doms: and that they have not known Him, hath been repeated in this, that they have not

called upon His name. How then must be understood, what the Lord saith in the Gospel
3710 concerning stripes, “the many and the few”? if greater the anger of God is against the
nations, which have not known the Lord? For in this which he saith, “Pour forth Thine anger,”
with this word he hath clearly enough pointed out, how great anger he hath willed that there
should be understood. Whence afterwards he saith, “Render to our neighbours seven times
as much.”3711 Is it not that there is a great difference between servants, who, though they
know not the will of their Lord, do yet call upon His name, and those that are aliens from
the family of so great a Master, who are so ignorant of God, as that they do not even call
upon God? For in place of Him they call upon either idols or demons, or any creature they
choose; not the Creator, who is blessed for ever. For those persons, concerning whom he is
prophesying this, he doth not even intimate to be so ignorant of the will of their God, as
that still they fear the Lord Himself; but so ignorant of the Lord Himself, that they do not
even call upon Him, and that they stand forth as enemies of His name. There is a great dif-
ference then between servants not knowing the will of their God, and yet living in His family
and in His house, and enemies not only setting the will against knowing the Lord Himself,
but also not calling upon His name, and even in His servants fighting against it.
10. Lastly, there followeth, “For they have eaten up Jacob, and his place they have made
desolate” (ver. 7).…How we should view “the place” of Jacob, must be understood. For
rather the place of Jacob may be supposed to be that city, wherein was also the Temple,
whither-unto the whole of that nation for the purpose of sacrifice and worship, and to cel-
ebrate the Passover, the Lord had commanded to assemble. For if the assemblies of Christians,
letted and suppressed by persecutors, has been what the Prophet would have to be under-
stood, it would seem that he should have said, places made desolate, not place. Still we may
take the singular number as put for the plural number; as dress for clothes, soldiery for sol-
diers, cattle for beasts: for many words are usually spoken in this manner, and not only in
the mouths of vulgar speakers, but even in the eloquence of the most approved authorities.
Nor to divine Scripture herself is this form of speech foreign. For even she hath put frog for
frogs, locust for locusts,3712 and countless expressions of the like kind. But that which hath
been said, “They have eaten up Jacob,” the same is well understood, in that many men into
their own evil-minded body, that is, into their own society, they have constrained to pass.
11. …He subjoineth, “Remember not our iniquities of old” (ver. 8). He saith not bygone,
which might have even been recent; but “of old,” that is, coming from parents. For to such
iniquities judgment, not correction, is3713 owing. “Speedily let Thy mercies anticipate us.”
3710 Luke xii. 47, 48.
3711 Ps. lxxix. 13.
3712 Ps. lxxviii. 46.
3713 Al. “would be.”
Psalm LXXIX
Anticipate, that is, at Thy judgment. For “mercy exalteth above in judgment.”3714 Now there
is “judgment without mercy,” but to him that hath not showed mercy. But whereas he addeth,
“for we have become exceeding poor:” unto this end he willeth that the mercies of God
should be understood to anticipate us; that our own poverty, that is, weakness, by Him
having mercy, should be aided to do His commandments, that we may not come to His
judgment to be condemned.
12. Therefore there followeth, “Help us, O God, our healing3715 One” (ver. 9). By this
word which he saith, “our healing One,” he doth sufficiently explain what sort of poverty
he hath willed to be understood, in that which he had said, “for we have become exceeding
poor.” For it is that very sickness, to which a healer is necessary. But while he would have
us to be aided, he is neither ungrateful to grace, nor doth he take away free-will. For he that
is aided, doth also of himself something. He hath added also, “for the glory of Thy Name,
O Lord, deliver us:” in order that he who glorieth, not in himself, but in the Lord may
glory.3716 “And merciful be Thou,” he saith, “to our sins for Thy Name’s sake:” not for our
sake. For what else do our sins deserve, but due and condign punishments? But “merciful
be Thou to our sins, for Thy Name’s sake.” Thus then Thou dost deliver us, that is, dost
rescue us from evil things, while Thou dost both aid us to do justice, and art merciful to our
sins, without which in this life we are not. For “in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.”
3717 But sin is iniquity.3718 And “if Thou shalt have marked iniquities, who shall stand?”3719
13. But that which he addeth, “lest at any time they should say among the Gentiles,
Where is their God?” (ver. 10) must be taken as rather for the Gentiles themselves. For to
a bad end they come that have despaired of the true God, thinking that either He is not, or
doth not help His own, and is not merciful to them. But this which followeth, “and that
there may be known among the nations before our eyes the vengeance of the blood of Thy
servants which hath been shed:” is either to be understood as of the time, when they believe
in the true God that used to persecute His inheritance; because even that is vengeance,
whereby is slain the fierce iniquity of them by the sword of the Word of God, concerning
which hath been said, “Gird Thou Thy sword:”3720 or when obstinate enemies at the last
are punished. For the corporal ills which they suffer in this world, they may have in common
with good men. There is also another kind of vengeance; that wherein the Church’s enlarge-

ment and fruitfulness in this world after so great persecutions, wherein they supposed she
would utterly perish, the sinner and unbeliever and enemy seeth, and is angry; “with his
teeth he shall gnash, and shall pine away.” 3721 For who would dare to deny that even this
is a most heavy punishment? But I know not whether that which he saith, “before our eyes,”
is taken with sufficient elegance, if by this sort of punishment we understand that which is
done in the inmost recesses of the heart, and doth torment even those who blandly smile at
us, while by us there cannot be seen what they suffer in the inner man. But the fact, that
whether in them believing their iniquity is slain, or whether the last punishment is rendered
to them persevering in their naughtiness, without difficulty of doubtfulness is understood
in the saying, “that there may be known before our eyes vengeance among the nations.”
14. And this indeed, as we have said, is a prophecy, not a wish.…And the Lord in the
Gospel3722 hath set before us the widow for an example, who longing to be avenged, did
intercede with the unjust judge, who at length heard her, not as being guided by justice, but
overcome with weariness: but this the Lord hath set before us, to show that much more the
just God will speedily make the judgment of His elect, who cry unto Him day and night.
Thence is also that cry of the Martyrs under the altar of God,3723 that they may be avenged
in the judgment of God. Where then is the, “Love your enemies, do good unto them that
hate you, and pray for them that persecute you”?3724 Where is also the, “Not rendering evil
for evil, nor cursing for cursing:”3725 and, “unto no man rendering evil for evil”?3726…For
when the Lord was exhorting us to love enemies, He set before us the example of our Father,
who is in Heaven, “who maketh His sun to rise upon good men and evil men, and raineth
upon just men and unjust men:”3727 doth He yet therefore not chasten even by temporal
correction, or not condemn at the last the obstinately hardened? Let therefore an enemy be
so loved as that the Lord’s justice whereby he is punished displease us not, and let the justice
whereby he is punished so please us, as that the joy is not at his evil but at the good Judge.
But a malevolent soul is sorrowful, if his enemy by being corrected shall have escaped pun-
ishment: and when he seeth him punished, he is so glad that he is avenged, that he is not
delighted with the justice of God, whom he loveth not, but with the misery of that man
whom he hateth: and when he leaveth judgment to God, he hopeth that God will hurt more
than he could hurt: and when he giveth food to his hungering enemy, and drink to him

thirsty, he hath an evil-minded sense of that which is written, “For thus doing thou shalt
heap coals of fire upon his head.”3728…In such sort then under the appearance of one asking
in this Psalm, future vengeance on the ungodly is prophesied of, as that we are to understand
that holy men of God have loved their enemies, and have wished no one anything but good,
which is godliness in this world, everlasting life in that to come; but in the punishments of
evil men, they have taken pleasure not in the ills of them, but in God’s good judgments; and
wheresoever in the holy Scriptures we read of their hatreds against men, they were the
hatreds of vices, which every man must needs hate in himself, if he loveth himself.
15. But now in that which followeth, “Let there come in before Thy sight,” or, as some
copies have it, “In Thy sight, the groans of the fettered:” not easily doth any one discover
that the Saints were thrown into fetters by persecutors; and if this doth happen amid so
great and manifold a variety of punishments, so rarely it doth happen, that it must not be
believed that the prophet had chosen to allude to this especially in this verse. But, in fact,
the fetters are the infirmity and the corruptibleness of the body, which do weigh down the
soul. For by means of the frailty thereof, as a kind of material for certain pains and troubles,
the persecutor might constrain her unto ungodliness. From these fetters the Apostle was
longing to be unbound, and to be with Christ;3729 but to abide in the flesh was necessary
for their sakes unto whom he was ministering the Gospel. Until then this corruptible put
on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality,3730 like as it were with fetters, the
weak flesh doth let the willing spirit.3731 These fetters then not any do feel, but they that in
themselves do groan being burthened, desiring to be clothed upon with the tabernacle which
is from Heaven;3732 because both death is a terror, and mortal life is sorrow. In behalf of
these men groaning the Prophet doth redouble his groaning, that their groaning may “come
in in the sight of the Lord.” They also may be understood to be fettered, who are enchained
with the precepts of wisdom, the which being patiently supported are turned into ornaments:
whence it hath been written, “Put thy feet into her fetters.”3733 “According to the greatness,”
he saith, “of Thy arm, receive Thou unto adoption the sons of them that are put to death:”3734
or, as is read in some copies, “Possess Thou sons by the death of the punished.”3735 Wherein
the Scripture seemeth to me to have sufficiently shown, what hath been the groan of the

fettered, who for the name of Christ endured most grievous persecutions, which in this
Psalm are most clearly prophesied. For being beset with divers sufferings, they used to pray
for the Church, that their blood might not be without fruit to posterity; in order that the
Lord’s harvest might more abundantly flourish by the very means whereby enemies thought
that she would perish. For “sons of them that were put to death” he hath called them who
were not only not terrified by the sufferings of those that went before, but in Him for whose
name they knew them to have suffered, being inflamed with their glory which did inspire
them to the like, in most ample hosts they believed. Therefore he hath said, “According to
the greatness of Thine arm.” For so great a wonder followed in the case of Christian peoples,
as they, who thought they would prevail aught by persecuting her, no wise believed would
follow.
16. “Render,” he saith, “to our neighbours seven times so much into their bosoms” (ver.
13). Not any evil things he is wishing, but things just he is foretelling and prophesying as to
come. But in the number seven, that is, in sevenfold retribution, he would have the complete-
ness of the punishment to be perceived, for with this number fulness is wont to be signified.
Whence also there is this saying for the good, “He shall receive in this world seven times as
much:”3736 which hath been put for all. “As if having nothing, and possessing all things.”3737
Of neighbours he is speaking, because amongst them dwelleth the Church even unto the
day of severing: for not now is made the corporal separation. “Into their bosoms,” he saith,
as being now in secret, so that the vengeance which is now being executed in secret in this
life, hereafter may be known among the nations before our eyes. For when a man is given
over to a reprobate mind, in his inward bosom he is receiving what he deserveth of future
punishments. “Their reproach wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.” This do
Thou render to them sevenfold into their bosoms, that is, in return for this reproach, most
fully do Thou rebuke them in their secret places. For in this they have reproached Thy Name,
thinking to efface Thee from the earth in Thy servants.
17. “But we Thy people” (ver. 14), must be taken generally of all the race of godly and
true Christians. “We,” then, whom they thought they had power to destroy, “Thy people,
and the sheep of thy flock:” in order that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord,3738 “will
confess to Thee for an age.” But some copies have it, “will confess to Thee for everlasting.”
Out of a Greek ambiguity this diversity hath arisen. For that which the Greek hath, εἰς τὸν
αἰῶνα, may be interpreted both by “for everlasting,” and “for an age;” but according to the
context we must understand which is the better interpretation. The sense then of this passage
seemeth to me to show, that we ought to say “for an age,” that is, even unto the end of time.

But the following verse after the manner of the Scriptures, and especially of the Psalms, is
a repetition of the former with the order changed, putting that before which in the former
case was after, and that after which in the former case was before. For whereas in the former
case there had been said, “we will confess to Thee,” instead of the same herein hath been
said, “We will proclaim Thy praise.” And so whereas in the former case there had been said,
“for an age,” instead of the same herein hath been said, “for generation and generation.”
For this repetition of generation doth signify perpetuity: or, as some understand it, it is be-
cause there are two generations, an old and a new.…But in many places of holy Scriptures
we have already made known to you that confession is also put for praise: as in this passage
it is, “These words ye shall say in confession, ‘That the works of the Lord are very good.’”
3739 And especially that which the Saviour Himself saith, who had not any sin at all, which
by repentance to confess: “I confess to Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou
hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.”3740 I
have said this, in order that it may be more clearly perceived how in the expression, “We
will proclaim Thy praise,” the same hath been repeated as had been said higher up, “We
will confess to Thee.”

Psalm LXXIX
Psalm LXXX.3741
1. …If perchance things obscure demand the office of an interpreter, those things which
are evident ought to require of me the office of a reader. The song here is of the Advent of
the Lord and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of His vineyard. But the singer of the song is
that Asaph, as far as doth appear, enlightened and converted, by whose name ye know the
synagogue to be signified. Lastly, the title of the Psalm is: “For the end in behalf of them
that shall be changed;” that is, for the better. For Christ, the end of the Law,3742 hath come
on purpose that He should change men for the better. And he addeth, “a testimony to Asaph
himself.” A good testimony of truth. Lastly, this testimony doth confess both Christ and the
vineyard; that is, Head and Body, King and people, Shepherd and flock, and the entire
mystery of all Scriptures, Christ and the Church. But the title of the Psalm doth conclude
with, “for the Assyrians.” The Assyrians are interpreted, “men guiding.” Therefore it is no
longer a generation which hath not guided the heart3743 thereof, but now a generation
guiding. Therefore hear we what he saith in this testimony.
2. What is, “Thou that feedest Israel, hearken, Thou that conducteth Joseph like sheep”?
(ver. 1). He is being invoked to come, He is being expected until He come, He is being
yearned for until He come. Therefore may He find “men guiding:” “Thou that conductest,”
he saith, “Joseph like sheep:” Joseph himself like sheep. Joseph himself are the sheep, and
Joseph himself is a sheep. Observe Joseph; for although even the interpretation of his name
doth aid us much, for it signifieth increase; and He came indeed in order that the grain
given to death3744 might arise manifold;3745 that is, that the people of God might be in-
creased.…“Thou that sittest upon the Cherubin.” Cherubin is the seat of the glory of God,
and is interpreted the fulness of knowledge. There God sitteth in the fulness of knowledge.
Though we understand the Cherubin to be the exalted powers and virtues of the heavens:
yet, if thou wilt, thou wilt be Cherubin.3746 For if Cherubin is the seat of God, hear what
saith the Scripture: “The soul of a just man is the seat of wisdom.” How, thou sayest, shall
I be the fulness of knowledge? Who shall fulfil this? Thou hast the means of fulfilling it:
“The fulness of the Law is love.”3747 Do not run after many things, and strain thyself. The
amplitude of the branches doth terrify thee: hold by the root, and of the greatness of the
tree think not. Be there in thee love, and the fulness of knowledge must needs follow. For

what doth he not know that knoweth love? Inasmuch as it hath been said, “God is love.”3748
“Appear.” For we went astray because Thou didst not appear. “Before Ephraim and Benjamin
and Manasse” (ver. 2). Appear, I say, before the nation of the Jews, before the people of Israel.
For there is Ephraim, there Manasses, there Benjamin. But to the interpretation let us look:
Ephraim is fruit-bearing, Benjamin son of right hand, Manasses one forgetful. Appear Thou
then before one made fruitful, before a son of the right hand: appear Thou before one for-
getful, in order that he may be no longer forgetful, but Thou mayest come into his mind
that hast delivered him.…For weak Thou wast when it was being said, “If Son of God He
is, let Him come down from the Cross.”3749 Thou wast seeming to have no power: the per-
secutor had power over Thee: and Thou didst show this aforetime, for Jacob too himself
prevailed in wrestling, a man with an angel. Would he at any time, except the angel had
been willing? And man prevailed, and the angel was conquered: and victorious man holdeth
the angel, and saith, “I will not let thee go, except thou shalt have blessed me.”3750 A great
sacrament! He both standeth conquered, and blesseth the conqueror. Conquered, because
he willed it; in flesh weak, in majesty strong.…Having been crucified of weakness, rise Thou
in power:3751 “Stir up Thy power, and come Thou, to save us.”
3. “O God, convert us.” For averse we have been from Thee, and except Thou convert
us, we shall not be converted. “And illumine Thy face, and we shall be saved” (ver. 3). Hath
He anywise a darkened face? He hath not a darkened face, but He placed before it a cloud
of flesh, and as it were a veil of weakness; and when He hung on the tree, He was not thought
the Same as He was after to be acknowledged when He was sitting in Heaven. For thus it
hath come to pass. Christ present on the earth, and doing miracles, Asaph knew not; but
when He had died, after that He rose again, and ascended into Heaven, he knew Him. He
was pricked to the heart, and he may have spoken3752 also of Him this testimony which
now we acknowledge in this Psalm. Thou didst cover Thy face, and we were sick: illumine
Thou the same, and we shall be whole.
4. “O Lord God of virtues, how long wilt Thou be angry with the prayer of Thy servant?”
(ver. 4). Now Thy servant. Thou wast angry at the prayer of Thy enemy, wilt Thou still be
angry with the prayer of Thy servant? Thou hast converted us, we know Thee, and wilt Thou
still be angry with the prayer of Thy servant? Thou wilt evidently be angry, in fact, as a
father correcting, not as a judge condemning. In such manner evidently Thou wilt be angry,
because it hath been written, “My son, drawing near unto the service of God, stand thou in

Psalm LXXX
righteousness and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.”3753 Think not that now the
wrath of God hath passed away, because thou hast been converted. The wrath of God3754
hath passed away from thee, but only so that it condemn not for everlasting. But He scour-
geth, He spareth not: because He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.3755 If thou refusest
to be scourged, why dost thou desire to be received? He scourgeth every son whom He re-
ceiveth. He who did not spare even His only Son, scourgeth every one. But nevertheless,
“How long wilt Thou be angry with the prayer of Thy servant?” No longer thine enemy:
but, “Thou wilt be angry with the prayer of Thy servant,” how long? There followeth: “Thou
wilt feed us with the bread of tears, and wilt give us to drink with tears in measure” (ver. 5).
What is, “in measure”? Hear the Apostle: “Faithful is God, who doth not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able to bear.”3756 The measure is, according to your powers: the
measure is, that thou be instructed, not that thou be crushed.
5. “Thou hast set us for a contradiction to our neighbours” (ver. 6). Evidently this did
come to pass: for out of Asaph were chosen they that should go to the Gentiles and preach
Christ, and should have it said to them, “Who is this proclaimer of new demons?”3757 “Thou
hast set us for a contradiction to our neighbours.” For they were preaching Him who was
the subject of the contradiction. Whom did they preach? That after He was dead, Christ
rose again. Who would hear this? Who would know this? It is a new thing. But signs did
follow, and to an incredible thing miracles gave credibility. He was contradicted, but the
contradictor was conquered, and from being a contradictor was made a believer. There,
however, was a great flame: there the martyrs fed with the bread of tears, and given to drink
in tears, but in measure, not more than they are able to bear; in order that after the measure
of tears there should follow a crown of joys. “And our enemies have sneered at us.” And
where are they that sneered? For a long while it was said, Who are they that worship the
Dead One, that adore the Crucified? For a long while so it was said. Where is the nose of
them that sneered? Now do not they that censure flee into caves, that they may not be seen?
But ye see what followeth: “O Lord God of virtues, convert us, and show Thy face, and we
shall be whole” (ver. 7). “A vineyard out of Egypt Thou hast brought over, Thou hast cast
out the nations, and hast planted her” (ver. 8). It was done, we know. How many nations
were cast out? Amorites, Cethites, Jebusites, Gergesites, and Evites: after whose expulsion

and overthrow, there was led in the people delivered out of Egypt, into the land of promise.
Whence the vineyard was cast out, and where she was planted, we have heard. Let us see
what next was done, how she believed, how much she grew, what ground she covered.
6. “A way Thou hast made in the sight of her, and hast planted the roots of her, and she
hath filled the land” (ver. 9). Would she have filled the land, unless a way had been made
in the sight of her? What was the way which was made in the sight of her? “I am,” He saith,
“the Way, the Truth, and the Life.”3758 With reason she hath filled the land. That hath now
been said of this vineyard, which hath been accomplished at the last. But in the mean time
what? “She hath covered the mountains with her shadow, and with her branch the cedars
of God” (ver. 10). “Thou hast stretched out her boughs even unto the sea, and even unto
the river her shoots” (ver. 11). This requireth the office of an expositor, that of a reader and
praiser3759 doth not suffice: aid me with attention; for the mention of this vineyard in this
Psalm is wont to overcloud with darkness the inattentive.…But nevertheless the first Jewish
nation was this vine. But the Jewish nation reigned as far as the sea and as far as the river.
As far as the sea; it appeareth in Scripture3760 that the sea was in the vicinity thereof. And
as far as the river Jordan. For on the other side of Jordan some part of the Jews was estab-
lished, but within Jordan was the whole nation. Therefore, “even unto the sea and even unto
the river,” is the kingdom of the Jews, the kingdom of Israel: but not “from sea even unto
sea, and from the river even unto the ends of the round world;”3761 this is the future perfec-
tion of the vineyard, concerning which in this place he hath foretold. When, I say, he had
foretold to thee the perfection, he returneth to the beginning, out of which the perfection
was made. Of the beginning wilt thou hear? “Even unto the river.” Of the end wilt thou
hear? “He shall have dominion from sea even unto sea:”3762 that is, “she hath filled the
earth.” Let us look then to the testimony of Asaph, as to what was done to the first vineyard,
and what must be expected for the second vineyard, nay to the same vineyard.…What then,
the vineyard before the sight whereof a way was made, that she should fill the earth, at first
was where? “Her shadow covered the mountains.” Who are the mountains? The Prophets.
Why did her shadow cover them? Because darkly they spake the things which were foretold
as to come. Thou hearest from the Prophets, Keep the Sabbath-day, on the eighth day cir-
cumcise a child, offer sacrifice of ram, of calf, of he-goat. Be not troubled, her shadow doth
cover the mountains of God; there will come after the shadow a manifestation. “And her
shrubs the cedars of God,” that is, she hath covered the cedars of God; very lofty, but of

God. For the cedars are types of the proud, that must needs be overthrown. The “cedars of
Lebanon,” the heights of the world, this vineyard did cover in growing, and the mountains
of God, all the holy Prophets and Patriarchs.
7. Then what? “Wherefore hast Thou thrown down her enclosure?” (ver. 12). Now ye
see the overthrow of that nation of the Jews: already out of another Psalm ye have heard,
“with axe and hammer3763 they have thrown her down.”3764 When could this have been
done, except her enclosure had been thrown down. What is her enclosure? Her defence.
For she bore herself proudly against her planter. The servants that were sent to her and de-
manded a recompense, the husbandmen they scourged, beat, slew: there came also the Only
Son, they said, “This is the Heir; come, let us kill Him, and our own the inheritance will be:”
they killed Him, and out of the vineyard they cast Him forth. 3765 When cast forth, He did
more perfectly possess the place whence He was cast forth. For thus He threatens her through
Isaiah, “I will throw down her enclosure.” Wherefore? “For I looked that she should bring
forth grapes, but she brought forth thorns.”3766 I looked for fruit from thence, and I found
sin. Why then dost thou ask, O Asaph, “Why hast Thou thrown down her enclosure?” For
knowest thou not why? I looked that she should do judgment, and she did iniquity. Must
not her enclosure needs be thrown down? And there came the Gentiles when the enclosure
was thrown down, the vineyard was assailed, and the kingdom of the Jews effaced. This at
first he is lamenting, but not without hope. For of directing the heart he is now speaking,
that is, for the “Assyrians,” for “men directing,” the Psalm is. “Wherefore hast Thou thrown
down her enclosure: and there pluck off her grapes all men passing along the way.” What
is “men passing along the way?” Men having dominion for a time.
8. “There hath laid her waste the boar from the wood” (ver. 13). In the boar from the
wood what do we understand? To the Jews a swine is an abomination, and in a swine they
imagine as it were the uncleanness of the Gentiles. But by the Gentiles was overthrown the
nation of the Jews: but that king who overthrew, was not only an unclean swine, but was
also a boar. For what is a boar but a savage swine, a furious swine? “A boar from the wood
hath laid her waste.” “From the wood,” from the Gentiles. For she was a vineyard, but the
Gentiles were woods. But when the Gentiles believed, there was said what? “Then there shall
exult all the trees of the woods.”3767 “The boar from the wood hath laid her waste; and a
singular wild beast hath devoured her.” “A singular wild beast” is what? The very boar that

3767 Ps. xcvi. 12.
Psalm LXXX
laid her waste is the singular wild beast. Singular, because proud. For thus saith every proud
one, It is I, it is I, and no other.
9. But with what profit is this? “O God of virtues turn Thou nevertheless” (ver. 14). Al-
though these things have been done, “Turn Thou nevertheless.” “Look from heaven and
see, and visit this vineyard.” “And perfect Thou her whom Thy right hand hath planted”
(ver. 15). No other plant Thou, but this make Thou perfect. For she is the very seed of Ab-
raham, she is the very seed in whom all nations shall be blessed:3768 there is the root where
is borne the graffed wild olive. “Perfect Thou this vineyard which Thy right hand hath
planted.” But wherein doth He perfect? “And upon the Son of man, whom Thou hast
strengthened to Thyself.” What can be more evident? Why do ye still expect, that we should
still explain to you in discourse, and should we not rather cry out with you in admiration,
“Perfect Thou this vineyard which Thy right hand hath planted, and upon the Son of man”
perfect her? What Son of man? Him “whom Thou hast strengthened to Thyself.” A mighty
stronghold: build as much as thou art able. “For other foundation no one is able to lay, except
that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.”3769
10. “Things burned with fire, and dug up, by the rebuke of Thy countenance shall perish”
(ver. 16). What are the things burned with fire and dug up which shall perish from the rebuke
of His countenance? Let us see and perceive what are the things burned with fire and dug
up. Christ hath rebuked what? Sins: by the rebuke of His countenance sins have perished.
Why then are sins burned with fire and dug up? Of all sins, two things are the cause in man,
desire and fear.3770 Think, examine, question your hearts, sift your consciences, see
whether there can be sins, except they be either of desire, or of fear. There is set before thee
a reward to induce thee to sin, that is, a thing which delighteth thee; thou doest it, because
thou desirest it. But perchance thou wilt not be allured by bribes; thou art terrified with
menaces, thou doest it because thou fearest. A man would bribe thee, for example, to bear
false witness. Countless cases there are, but I am setting before you the plainer cases, whereby
ye may imagine the rest. Hast thou hearkened unto God, and hast thou said in thy heart,
“What doth it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, but of his own soul suffer loss?”3771
I am not allured by a bribe to lose my soul3772 to gain money. He turneth himself to stir up
fear within thee, he who was not able to corrupt thee with a bribe, beginneth to threaten
loss, banishment, massacres, perchance, and death. Therein now, if desire prevailed not,
perchance fear will prevail to make thee sin.…What had evil fear done? It had dug up, as it

3770 All sins are either of desire or of fear.

3772 Or, “life.”

were. For love doth inflame, fear doth humble: therefore, sins of evil love, with fire were
lighted: sins of evil fear were dug up. On the one hand, evil fear doth humble, and good love
doth light; but in different ways respectively. For even the husbandman interceding for the
tree, that it should not be cut down, saith, “I will dig about it, and will apply a basket of
dung.”3773 The dug trench doth signify the godly humility of one fearing, and the basket of
dung the profitable squalid state of one repenting. But concerning the fire of good love the
Lord saith, “Fire I have come to send into the world.”3774 With which fire may the fervent
in spirit burn, and they too that are inflamed with the love of God and their neighbour. And
thus, as all good works are wrought by good fear and good love, so by evil fear and evil love
all sins are committed. Therefore, “Things set alight with fire and dug up,” to wit, all sins,
“by the rebuke of Thy countenance shall perish.”
11. “Let Thy hand be upon the Man of Thy right hand, and upon the Son of Man whom
Thou hast strengthened Thyself” (ver. 17). “And we depart not from Thee.…Thou wilt
quicken us, and Thy Name we will invoke” (ver. 18). Thou shalt be sweet to us, “Thou wilt
quicken us.” For aforetime we did love earth, not Thee: but Thou hast mortified our members
which are upon the earth.3775 For the Old Testament, having earthly promises, seemeth to
exhort that God should not be loved for nought, but that He should be loved because He
giveth something on earth. What dost thou love, so as not to love God? Tell me. Love, if
thou canst, anything which He hath not made. Look round upon the whole creation, see
whether in any place thou art held with the birdlime of desire, and hindered from loving
the Creator, except it be by that very thing which He hath Himself created, whom thou
despisest. But why dost thou love those things, except because they are beautiful? Can they
be as beautiful as He by whom they were made? Thou admirest these things, because thou
seest not Him: but through those things which thou admirest, love Him whom thou seest
not. Examine the creation; if of itself it is, stay therein: but if it is of Him, for no other reason
is it prejudicial to a lover, than because it is preferred to the Creator. Why have I said this?
With reference to this verse, brethren. Dead, I say, were they that did worship God that it
might be well with them after the flesh: “For to be wise after the flesh is death:”3776 and dead
are they that do not worship God gratis, that is, because of Himself He is good, not because
He giveth such and such good things, which He giveth even to men not good. Money wilt
thou have of God? Even a robber hath it. Wife, abundance of children, soundness of body,
the world’s dignity, observe how many evil men have. Is this all for the sake of which thou
dost worship Him? Thy feet will totter,3777 thou wilt suppose thyself to worship without

cause, when thou seest those things to be with them who do not worship Him. All these
things, I say, He giveth even to evil men, Himself alone He reserveth for good men. “Thou
wilt quicken us;” for dead we were, when to earthly things we did cleave; dead we were,
when of the earthly man we did bear the image. “Thou wilt quicken us;” Thou wilt renew
us, the life of the inward man Thou wilt give us. “And Thy Name we will invoke;” that is,
Thee we will love. Thou to us wilt be the sweet forgiver of our sins, Thou wilt be the entire
reward of the justified. “O Lord God of virtues, convert us, and show Thy face, and we shall
be whole” (ver. 20).
Psalm LXXX
Psalm LXXXI.3778
1. For a Title this Psalm hath, “Unto the end for the presses, on the fifth of the Sabbath,
a Psalm to Asaph himself.” Into one title many mysteries are heaped together, still so that
the lintel of the Psalm indicates the things within. As we have to speak of the presses, let no
one expect that we shall speak of a vat, of a press, of olive baskets;3779 because neither the
Psalm hath this, and therefore it indicateth the greater mystery.…
No such thing did ye hear in this when it was reading. Therefore take the presses for
the mystery of the Church, which is now transacting. In the presses we observe three things,
pressure, and of the pressure two things, one to be laid up, the other to be thrown away.
There takes place then in the press a treading, a crushing, a weight: and with these the oil
strains out secretly into the vat,3780 the lees run openly down the streets.
Look intently on this great spectacle. For God ceaseth not to exhibit to us that which
we may look upon with great joy, nor is the madness of the Circus to be compared with this
spectacle. That belongeth to the lees, this to the oil. When therefore ye hear the blasphemers
babble impudently and say that distresses abound in Christian times; for ye know that they
love to say this: and it is an old proverb, yet one that began from Christian times, “God gives
no rain; count it to the Christians!”3781 Although it was those of old that said thus. But these
now say also, “That God sends rain, count it to the Christians! God sends no rain; we sow
not. God sends rain; we reap not!” And they wilfully make that an occasion of showing
pride, which ought to make them more earnest in supplication, choosing rather to blaspheme
than to pray.
When therefore they talk of such things, when they make such boasts, when they say
these things, and say them in defiance, not with fear, but with loftiness, let them not disturb
you. For suppose that pressures abound; be thou oil. Let the lees, black with the darkness
of ignorance, be insolent; and let it, as though cast away in the streets, go gibing publicly:

of the like complaints with respect to other calamities; to which may be added, St. Aug. De. Civ. Dei, i. c. 1, of

but do thou by thyself in thy heart, where He who seeth in secret will requite thee, strain off
into the vat.
…To name some one thing about which even they murmur who make them: How great
plunderings, they say, are there in our times, how great distresses of the innocent, how great
robberies of other men’s goods! Thus indeed thou takest notice of the lees, that other men’s
goods are seized; to the oil thou givest no heed, that to the poor are given even men’s own.
The old time had no such plunderers of other men’s goods: but the old time had no such
givers of their own goods.…
2. Wherefore also “on the fifth of the sabbath”?3782 What is this? Let us go back to the
first works of God, if perchance we may not there find somewhat in which we may also
understand a mystery. For the sabbath is the seventh day, on which “God rested from all
His works,”3783 intimating the great mystery of our future resting from all our works. First
of the sabbath then is called that first day, which we also call the Lord’s day; second of the
sabbath, the second day;…and the sabbath itself the seventh day. See ye therefore to whom
this Psalm speaketh. For it seems to me that it speaketh to the baptized. For on the fifth day
God from the waters created animals: on the fifth day, that is, on the “fifth of the sabbath,”
God said, “Let the waters bring forth creeping things of living souls.”3784 See ye, therefore,
ye in whom the waters have already brought forth creeping things of living souls. For ye
belong to the presses, and in you, whom the waters have brought forth, one thing is strained
out, another is thrown away. For there are many that live not worthily of the baptism which
they have received. For how many that are baptized have chosen rather to be filling the
Circus than this Basilica! How many that are baptized are either making booths in the streets,
or complaining that they are not made!
But this Psalm, “For the presses,” and “on the fifth of the sabbath,” is sung “unto Asaph.”
Asaph was a certain man called by this name, as Idithun, as Core, as other names that we
find in the titles of the Psalms: yet the interpretation of this name intimates the mystery of
a hidden truth. Asaph, in fact, in Latin is interpreted “congregation.” Therefore, “For the
presses, on the fifth of the sabbath,” it is sung “unto Asaph,” that is, for a distinguishing
pressure, to the baptized, born again of water, the Psalm is sung to the Lord’s congregation.
We have read the title on the lintel, and have understood what it means by these “presses.”
Now if you please let us see the very house of the composition, that is, the interior of the
press. Let us enter, look in, rejoice, fear, desire, avoid. For all these things ye are to find in
this inward house, that is, in the text of the Psalm itself, when we shall have begun to read,
and, with the Lord’s help, to speak what He grants us.

Psalm LXXXI
3. Behold yourselves, O Asaph, congregation of the Lord. “Exult ye unto God our
helper” (ver. 1). Ye who are gathered together to-day, ye are this day the congregation of
the Lord, if indeed unto you the Psalm is sung, “Exult ye unto God our helper.” Others exult
unto the Circus, ye unto God: others exult unto their deceiver, do ye exult unto your helper:
others exult unto their god their belly, do ye exult unto your God your helper. “Jubilate
unto the God of Jacob.” Because ye also belong to Jacob: yea, ye are Jacob, the younger
people to which the elder is servant.3785 “Jubilate unto the God of Jacob.” Whatsoever ye
cannot explain in words, ye do not therefore forbear exulting: what ye shall be able to explain,
cry out: what ye cannot, jubilate. For from the abundance of joys, he that cannot find words
sufficient, useth to break out into jubilating; “Jubilate unto the God of Jacob.”
4. “Take the Psalm and give the tabret” (ver. 2). Both “take,” and “give.” What is, “take”?
what, “give”? “Take the Psalm, and give the tabret.” The Apostle Paul saith in a certain
place,3786 reproving and grieving, that no one had communicated with him in the matter
of giving and receiving. What is, “in the matter of giving and receiving,” but that which he
hath openly set forth in another place.3787 “If we have sowed unto you spiritual things, is it
a great thing if we reap your carnal things.” And it is true that a tabret, which is made of
hide, belongs to the flesh. The Psalm, therefore, is spiritual, the tabret, carnal. Therefore,
people of God, congregation of God, “take ye the Psalm, and give the tabret:” take ye spir-
itual things, and give carnal. This also is what at that blessed Martyr’s table3788 we exhorted
you, that receiving spiritual things ye should give carnal. For these which are built for the
time, are needful for receiving the bodies either of the living or of the dead, but in time that
is passing by. Shall we after God’s judgment take up these buildings to Heaven? Yet without
these we shall not be able to do at this time the things which belong to the possessing of
Heaven. If therefore ye are eager in getting spiritual things, be ye devout in expending carnal
things. “Take the Psalm, and give the tabret:” take our voice, return your hands.
5. “The pleasant psaltery,3789 with the harp.” I remember that we once intimated to
your charity the difference of psaltery and harp.3790…For heavenly is the preaching of the
3785 Gen. xxv. 23.
3786 Phil. iv. 15.
3787 1 Cor. ix. 11.
3788 St. Cyprian’s, who is named in § 21, note 4; namely, at Carthage, on the spot of his martyrdom. “In that
same place,” says St. Augustin, Ser. 113, “a table was constructed to God, which is called Cyprian’s table, not
because Cyprian ever ate there, but because there he was offered up, and because by that very offering of his he
prepared that table, not to feed or be fed on, but whereon sacrifice might be offered to God, to whom himself
also was offered.”—Ben.
3789 Or, “The psaltery is pleasant.”
3790 [He repeats. See Ps. xliii. 4, p. 139, supra.—C.]
Psalm LXXXI
word of God. But if we wait for heavenly things, let us not be sluggish in working at earthly
things; because, “the psaltery is pleasant,” but, “with the harp.” The same is expressed in
another way as above, “Take the Psalm, and give the tabret:” here for “Psalm,” is put “psal-
tery,” for “tabret,” “harp.” Of this, however, we are admonished, that to the preaching of
God’s word we make answer by bodily works.
6. “Sound the trumpet” (ver. 3). This is, Loudly and boldly preach, be not affrighted! as
the Prophet says in a certain place, “Cry out, and lift up as with a trumpet thy voice.”3791
Sound the trumpet in the beginning of the month of the trumpet.” It was ordered, that in
the beginning of the month there should be a sounding of the trumpet: and this even now
the Jews do in bodily sort, after the spirit they understand it not. For the beginning of the
month, is the new moon: the new moon, is the new life. What is the new moon? “If any,
then, is in Christ, he is a new creature.”3792 What is, “sound the trumpet in the beginning
of the month of the trumpet”? With all confidence preach ye the new life, fear not the noise
of the old life.
7. “Because it is a commandment for Israel, and a judgment for the God of Jacob” (ver.
4). Where a commandment, there judgment. For, “They that have sinned in the Law, by the
Law shall be judged.”3793 And the very Giver of the commandment, the Lord Christ, the
Word made flesh, saith, “For judgment I am come into the world, that they that see not may
see, and they that see may be made blind.”3794 What is, “That they that see not may see,
they that see be made blind,” but that the lowly be exalted, the proud thrown down? For
not they that see are to be made blind, but those who to themselves seem to see are to be
convicted of blindness. This is brought about in the mystery of the press, that they who see
may not see, and they that see be made blind.
8. “A testimony in Joseph He made that” (ver. 5). Look you, brethren, what is it? Joseph
is interpreted augmentation. Ye remember, ye know of Joseph sold into Egypt: Joseph sold
into Egypt3795 is Christ passing over to the Gentiles. There Joseph after tribulations was
exalted, and here Christ, after the suffering of the Martyrs, was glorified. Thenceforth to
Joseph the Gentiles rather belong, and thenceforth augmentation; because, “Many are the
children of her that was desolate, rather than of her that hath the husband.”3796 “He made
it, till he should go out of the land of Egypt.” Observe that also here the “fifth of the sabbath”
is signified: when Joseph went out from the land of Egypt, that is, the people multiplied

through Joseph, he was caused to pass through the Red Sea. Therefore then also the waters
brought forth creeping things of living souls.3797 No other thing was it that there in figure
the passage of that people through the sea foreshowed, than the passing of the Faithful
through Baptism; the apostle is witness: for “I would not have you ignorant, brethren,” he
said, “that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all
baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.”3798 Nothing else then the passing through
the sea did signify, but the Sacrament of the baptized; nothing else the pursuing Egyptians,
but the multitude of past sins. Ye see most evident mysteries. The Egyptians press, they
urge; so then sins follow close, but no farther than to the water. Why then dost thou fear,
who hast not yet come, to come to the Baptism of Christ, to pass through the Red Sea? What
is “Red”? Consecrated with the Blood of the Lord. Why fearest thou to come? The conscious-
ness, perhaps, of some huge offences goads and tortures in thee thy mind, and says to thee
that it is so great a thing thou hast committed, that thou mayest despair to have it remitted
thee. Fear lest there remain anything of thy sins, if there lived any one of the Egyptians!3799
But when thou shalt have passed the Red Sea, when thou shalt have been led forth out
of thine offences “with a mighty hand and with a strong arm,”3800 thou wilt perceive mys-
teries that thou knowest not: since Joseph himself too, “when he came out of the land of
Egypt, heard a language which he knew not.” Thou shalt hear a language which thou
knowest not: which they that know now hear and recognise, bearing witness and knowing.
Thou shalt hear where thou oughtest to have thy heart:3801 which just now when I said
many understood and answered by acclamation, the rest stood mute, because they have not
heard the language which they knew not. Let them hasten, then, let them pass over, let them
learn.
9. “He turned away from burdens his back” (ver. 6). Who “turned away from burdens
his back,” but He that cried, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden”?3802
In another manner this same thing is signified. What the pursuit of the Egyptians did, the
same thing do the burdens of sins. As if thou shouldest say, From what burdens? “His hands
in the basket did serve.” By the basket are signified servile works; to cleanse, to manure, to
carry earth, is done with a basket,3803 such works are servile: because “every one that doeth
sin, is the slave of sin;” and “if the Son shall have made you free, then will ye be free in-

deed.”3804 Justly also are the rejected things of the world counted as baskets, but even baskets
did God fill with morsels; “Twelve baskets”3805 did He fill with morsels; because “He chose
the rejected things of this world to confound the things that were mighty.”3806 But also
when with the basket Joseph did serve, he then carried earth, because he did make bricks.
“His hands in the basket did serve.”
10. “In tribulation thou didst call on Me, and I delivered thee” (ver. 8). Let each Christian
conscience recognise itself, if it have devoutly passed the Red Sea,3807 if with faith in believing
and observing it hath heard a strange language which it knew not, let it recognise itself as
having been heard in its tribulation. For that was a great tribulation, to be weighed down
with loads of sins. How does the conscience, lifted from the earth, rejoice. Lo, thou art
baptized, thy conscience which was yesterday overladen, to-day rejoiceth thee. Thou hast
been heard in tribulation, remember thy tribulation. Before thou camest to the water, what
anxiety didst thou bear on thee! what fastings didst thou practise! what tribulations didst
thou carry in thy heart! what inward, pious, devout prayers! Slain are thine enemies; all thy
sins are blotted out. In tribulation thou didst call upon Me, and I delivered thee.
11. “I heard thee in the hidden part of the tempest.” Not in a tempest of the sea, but in
a tempest of the heart. “I proved thee in the water of contradiction.” Truly, brethren, truly,
he that was heard in the hidden part of the tempest ought to be proved in the water of con-
tradiction. For when he hath believed, when he hath been baptized, when he hath begun to
go in the way of God, when he hath striven to be strained into the vat, and hath drawn
himself out from the lees that run in the street, he will have many disturbers, many insulters,
many detractors, many discouragers, many that even threaten where they can, that deter,
that depress. This is all the “water of contradiction.” I suppose there are some here to-day,
for instance, I think it likely there are some here whom their friends wished to hurry away
to the circus, and to I know not what triflings of this day’s festivity: perchance they have
brought those persons with them to church. But whether they have brought those with them,
or whether they have by them not permitted themselves to be led away to the circus, in the
“water of contradiction” have they been tried. Do not then be ashamed to proclaim what
thou knowest, to defend even among blasphemers what thou hast believed.…However much
the bad that are aliens may rage, O that our own bad people would not help them!
Ye recollect what was said of Christ, that He was thus born for “the fall of many, and
the rising again of many, and for a sign to be spoken against.”3808 We know, we see: the

Psalm LXXXI
sign of the Cross has been set up, and it has been spoken against. There has been speaking
against the glory of the Cross: but there was a title over the Cross which was not to be cor-
rupted. For there is a title in the Psalm,3809 “For the inscription of the title, corrupt thou
not.” It was a sign to be spoken against: for the Jews said, “Make it not, King of the Jews,
but make it, that He said I am the King of the Jews.”3810 Conquered was the contradiction;
it was answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
12. All this, from the beginning of the Psalm up to this verse, we have heard of the oil
of the press. What remains is rather for grief and warning: for it belongs to the lees of the
press, even to the end; perchance also not without a meaning in the interposition of the
“Diapsalma.” But even this too is profitable to hear, that he who sees himself already of the
oil may rejoice; he that is in danger of running among the lees may beware. To both give
heed, choose the one, fear the other.
“Hear, O My people, and I will speak, and will bear witness unto thee”(ver. 8). For it is
not to a strange people, not to a people that belongs not to the press: “Judge ye,” He saith,
“between Me and My vineyard.”3811
13. “Israel, if thou shalt have heard Me, there shall not be in thee any new god” (ver. 9).
A “new god” is one made for the time: but our God is not new, but from eternity to eternity.
And our Christ is new, perchance, as Man,3812 but eternal God. For what before the begin-
ning? And truly, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.”3813 And our Christ Himself is the Word made flesh, that He might dwell
in us.3814 Far be it, then, that there should be in any one a new god. A new god is either a
stone or a phantom. He is not, saith one, a stone; I have a silver and a gold one. Justly did
he choose to name the very costly things, who said, “The idols of the nations are silver and
gold.” Great are they, because they are of gold and silver; costly they are, shining they are;
but yet, “Eyes they have, and see not!”3815 New are these gods. What newer than a god out
of a workshop? Yea, though those now old ones spiders’ webs have covered over, they that
are not eternal are new. So much for the Pagans.3816…
14. For if there be error in thee, Thou wilt not worship a strange god. If thou think not
of a false god, thou wilt not worship a manufactured god: for “there will not” be in thee any

strange god. “For I am.” Why wouldest thou adore what is not? “For I am the Lord thy God”
(ver. 10). Because “I am I that Am,” and indeed “I Am” He saith, I that Am, over every
creature: yet to thee what good have I afforded in time? “Who brought thee out of the land
of Egypt.” Not to that people alone is it said. For we all were brought out of the land of Egypt,
we have all passed through the Red Sea; our enemies pursuing us have perished in the water.
Let us not be ungrateful to our God; let us not forget God that abideth, and fabricate in
ourselves a new god. “I, who led thee out of the land of Egypt,” saith God. “Open wide thy
mouth, and I will fill it.” Thou sufferest straitness in thyself because of the new god set up
in thy heart; break the vain image, cast down from thy conscience the feigned idol: “open
wide thy mouth,” in confessing, in loving: “and I will fill it,” because with me is the fountain
of life.
15. “And My people obeyed not My voice” (ver. 11). For He would not speak these
things except to His own people. For, “we know that whatsoever things the Law saith, it
saith to them that are in the Law.”3817 “And Israel did not listen to Me.” Who? To whom?
Israel to Me. O ungrateful soul! Through Me the soul, by Me the soul called, by Me brought
back to hope, by Me washed from sins! “And Israel did not listen to Me!” For they are bap-
tized and pass through the Red Sea: but on the way they murmur, gainsay, complain, are
stirred with seditions, ungrateful to Him who delivered them from pursuing enemies, who
leads through the dry land, through the desert, yet with food and drink, with light by night
and shade by day.
16. “And I let them go according to the affections of their heart” (ver. 12). Behold the
press: the orifices are open, the lees run. “And I let them go,” not according to the healthful-
ness of My commands; but, according to the affections of their heart: I gave them up to
themselves. The Apostle also saith, “God gave them up to the desires of their own hearts.”3818
“I let them go according to the affection of their heart, they shall go in their own affections.”
There is what ye shudder at, if at least ye are straining out into the hidden vats of the Lord,
if at least ye have conceived a hearty love for His storehouses, there is what ye shudder at.
Some stand up for the circus, some for the amphitheatre, some for the booths in the streets
some for the theatres, some for this, some for that, some finally for their “new gods;” “they
shall go in their own affections.”
17. “If My people would have heard Me, if Israel would have walked in My ways” (ver.
13). For perchance that Israel saith, Behold I sin, it is manifest, I go after the affections of
my own heart: but what can I do?3819 The devil doth this. Demons do this. What is the
devil? Who are the demons? Certainly thine enemies. “Unto nothing all their enemies I

would have brought down; and on them that oppress them I would have sent forth My
hand” (ver. 14). But now what have they to do to complain of enemies? Themselves are be-
come the worse enemies. For how? What followeth? Of enemies ye complain, yourselves,
what are ye?
18. “The enemies of God have lied unto Him” (ver. 15). Dost thou renounce? I re-
nounce.3820 And he returns to what he renounced. In fact, what things dost thou renounce,
except bad deeds, diabolical deeds, deeds to be condemned of God, thefts, plunderings,
perjuries, manslayings, adulteries, sacrileges, abominable rites, curious arts.3821…
19. If therefore all those works “shall not possess the kingdom of God” (yea not the
works, but “they that do such things;”3822 for such works there shall be none in the fire: for
they shall not, while burning in that fire, be committing theft or adultery; but “they that do
such things shall not possess the kingdom of God”); they shall not therefore be on the right
hand, with those to whom it shall be said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, receive the
kingdom:” because, “they that do such things shall not possess the kingdom of God.” If
therefore on the right they shall not be, there remaineth not but that they must be on the
left. To those on the left what shall He say? “Go ye into eternal fire.” Because, “their time
shall be for ever.”
20. Explain to us, then, saith one, how those that build wood, hay, stubble, on the
foundation, do not perish, but “are saved, yet so as by fire”? An obscure question indeed
that, but as I am able I tell you briefly. Brethren, there are men altogether despisers of this
world, to whom nothing is pleasant that flows in the course of time, they cling not by love
to any earthly works, holy, chaste, continent, just, perchance even selling all their goods and
distributing to the poor, or “possessing as though they possessed not, and using this world
as though not using it.”3823 But there are others who cling to things allowed to infirmity
with a degree of affection. He robs not another of his estate, but so loves his own, that if he
loses it he will be disturbed. He does not covet another’s wife, but so clings to his own, so
cohabits with his own, as not therein to keep the measure prescribed in the laws, for the
sake of begetting children. He does not take away other men’s things, but reclaims his own,
and has a law-suit with his brother. For to such it is said, “Now indeed there is altogether a
fault among you, because ye have law-suits with each other.”3824 But these very suits he
orders to be tried in the Church, not to be dragged into court, yet he says they are faults.
For a Christian contends for earthly things more than becomes one to whom the kingdom
3820 He alludes to the form of interrogatory at Baptism.

of Heaven is promised. Not the whole of his heart doth he raise upward, but some part of
it he draggeth on the earth.…Therefore if thou lovest thy possession, yet dost not for its
sake commit violence, dost not for its sake bear false witness, dost not for its sake commit
manslaughter, dost not for its sake swear falsely, dost not for its sake deny Christ: in that
thou wilt not for its sake do these things, thou hast Christ for a foundation. But yet because
thou lovest it, and art saddened if thou losest it, upon the foundation thou hast placed, not
gold, or silver, or precious stones, but wood, hay, stubble. Saved therefore thou wilt be, when
that begins to burn which thou hast built, yet so as by fire. For let no one on this foundation
building adulteries, blasphemies, sacrileges, idolatries, perjuries, think he shall be “saved
through fire,” as though they were the “wood, hay, stubble:” but he that buildeth the love
of earthly things on the foundation of the kingdom of Heaven, that is upon Christ, his love
of temporal things shall be burned, and himself shall be saved through the right3825 found-
ation.
21. …“And He fed them of the fat of wheat, and from the rock with honey He satisfied
them” (ver. 16). In the wilderness from the rock He brought forth water,3826 not honey.
“Honey” is wisdom, holding the first place for sweetness among the viands of the heart.
How many enemies of the Lord, then, that lie unto the Lord, are fed not only of the fat of
wheat, but also from the rock with honey, from the wisdom of Christ? How many are de-
lighted with His word, and with the knowledge of His sacraments, with the unfolding of
His parables, how many are delighted, how many applaud with clamour! And this honey
is not from any chance person, but “from the rock.” But “the Rock was Christ.”3827 How
many, then, are satisfied with that honey, cry out, and say, It is sweet; say, Nothing better,
nothing sweeter could be thought or said! and yet the enemies of the Lord have lied unto
Him. I like not to dwell any more on matters of grief; although the Psalm endeth in terror
to this purpose, yet from the end of it, I pray you, let us return to the heading: “Exult unto
God our Helper.” Turned unto God.3828

A similar incidental addition occurs at the end of the exposition of Ps. lxii. [After this ceremony (after the word)
he adds: “Not lightly have your minds in the name of Christ been occupied with the Divine exhibitions, and
raised to earnestness, not only for desiring some things, but also for shunning some things. These are the exhib-
itions that are useful, healthful, building up, not destroying: yea both destroying and building up, destroying
‘new gods,’ building up faith in the true and eternal God. Also for to-morrow we invite your love. To-morrow,
they have, as we have heard, a sea in the theatre; let us have a harbour in Christ. But since the day after to-morrow,
that is, the fourth of the week, we cannot meet at the ‘Table of Cyprian,’ because it is the festival of the holy
Martyrs, to-morrow let us meet at that Table.” See p. 391, supra.—C.]
Psalm LXXXI
Psalm LXXXII.3829
1. This Psalm, like others similarly named, was so entitled either from the name of the
man who wrote it, or from the explanation of that same name, so as to refer in meaning to
the Synagogue, which Asaph signifies; especially as this is intimated in the first verse. For
it begins, “God stood in the synagogue of gods” (ver. 1). Far however be it from us to under-
stand by these Gods the gods of the Gentiles, or idols, or any creature in heaven or earth
except men; for a little after this verse the same Psalm relates and explains what Gods it
means in whose synagogue God stood, where it says, “I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are
all the children of the Most High: but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.”
In the synagogue of these children of the Most High, of whom the same Most High said by
the mouth of Isaiah, “I have begotten sons and brought them up, but they despised Me,”3830
stood God. By the synagogue we understand the people of Israel, because synagogue is the
word properly used of them, although they were also called the Church. Our congregation,
on the contrary, the Apostles never called synagogue, but always Ecclesia; whether for the
sake of the distinction, or because there is some difference between a congregation whence
the synagogue has its name, and a convocation whence the Church is called Ecclesia:3831
for the word congregation (or flocking together) is used of cattle, and particularly of that
kind properly called “flocks,”3832 whereas convocation (or calling together) is more of
reasonable creatures, such as men are.…I think then that it is clear in what synagogue of
gods God stood.
2. The next question is, whether we should understand the Father, or the Son, or the
Holy Spirit, or the Trinity, “to have stood among the congregation of gods, and in the midst
to distinguish the gods;” because Each One is God, and the Trinity itself is One God. It is
not indeed easy to make this clear, because it cannot be denied that not a bodily but a spir-
itual presence of God, agreeable to His nature, exists with created things in a wonderful
manner, and one which but a few do understand, and that imperfectly: as to God it is said,
“If I shall ascend into heaven, Thou art there; if I shall go down into hell, Thou art there
also.”3833 Hence it is rightly said, that God stands in the congregation of men invisibly, as
He fills heaven and earth, which He asserts of Himself by the Prophet’s mouth;3834 and He
is not only said, but is, in a way, known to stand in those things which He hath created, as
far as the human mind can conceive, if man also stands and hears Him, and rejoices greatly

Psalm LXXXII
on account of His voice within. But I think that the Psalm intimates something that took
place at a particular time, by God’s standing in the congregation of gods. For that standing
by which He fills heaven and earth, neither belongs peculiarly to the synagogue, nor varies
from time to time. “God,” therefore, “stood in the congregation of gods;” that is, He who
said of Himself, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”3835 The cause
too is mentioned; “but in the midst, to judge of the gods.”…
3. “How long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the persons of the ungodly” (ver.
2); as in another place, “How long are ye heavy in heart?”3836 Until He shall come who is
the light of the heart? I have given a law, ye have resisted stubbornly: I sent Prophets, ye
treated them unjustly, or slew them, or connived at those who did so. But if they are not
worthy to be even spoken to, who slew the servants of God that were sent to them, ye who
were silent when these things were doing, that is, ye who would imitate as if they were inno-
cent those who then were silent, “how long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the persons
of the ungodly?” If the Heir comes even now, is He to be slain? Was He not willing for your
sake to become as it were a child under guardians? Did not He for your sake hunger and
thirst like one in need? Did He not cry to you, “Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of
heart”?3837 Did He not “become poor, when He was rich, that by His poverty we might be
made rich”?3838 “Give sentence,” therefore, “for the fatherless3839 and the poor man, justify
the humble and needy” (ver. 3). Not them who for their own sake are rich and proud, but
Him who for your sake was humble and poor, believe ye to be righteous: proclaim Him
righteous. But they will envy Him, and will not at all spare Him, saying, “This is the Heir,
come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance shall be ours.” “Deliver,” then, “the poor man,
and save the needy from the hands of the ungodly” (ver. 4). This is said that it might be
known, that in that nation where Christ was born and put to death, those persons were not
guiltless of so great a crime, who being so numerous, that, as the Gospel says, the Jews feared
them, and therefore dared not lay hands on Christ, afterwards consented, and permitted
Him to be slain by the malicious and envious Jewish rulers: yet if they had so willed, they
would still have been feared, so that the hands of the wicked would never have prevailed
against Him. For of these it is said elsewhere, “Dumb dogs, they know not how to bark.” Of
them too is that said, “Lo, how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart.”3840
He perished3841 as far as lay in them who would have Him to perish; for how could He

perish by dying, who in that way rather was seeking again what had perished? If then they
are justly blamed and deservedly rebuked, who by their dissembling suffered such a wicked
deed to be committed; how must they be blamed, or rather not only blamed, but how severely
must they be condemned, who did this of design and malice?
4. To all of them, verily, what follows is most fitly suited: “They did not know nor un-
derstand, they walk on in darkness” (ver. 5). “For if even they had known, they would never
have crucified the Lord of glory:”3842 and those others, if they had known, would never have
consented to ask that Barabbas should be freed, and Christ should be crucified. But as the
above-mentioned blindness happened in part unto Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles
should come in, this blindness of that People having caused the crucifixion of Christ, “all
the foundations of the earth shall be moved.” So have they been moved, and shall they be
moved, until the predestined fulness of the Gentiles shall come in. For at the actual death
of the Lord the earth was moved, and the rocks rent.3843 And if we understand by the
foundations of the earth those who are rich in the abundance of earthly possessions, it was
truly foretold that they should be moved, either by wondering that lowliness, poverty, death,
should be so loved and honoured in Christ, when it is to their mind great misery; or even
in that themselves should love and follow it, and set at nought the vain happiness of this
world. So are all the foundations of the earth moved, while they partly admire, and partly
are even altered. For as without absurdity we call foundations of heaven those on whom the
kingdom of heaven is built up in the persons of saints and faithful; whose first foundation
is Christ Himself, born of the Virgin, of whom the Apostle says, “Other foundation can no
man lay than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus;”3844 next the Apostles and Prophets
themselves, by whose authority the heavenly place is chosen,3845 that by obeying them we
may be builded together with them; whence he says to the Ephesians, “Ye are built upon
the foundation of Apostles and Prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the chief corner
stone.”3846…But the kingdom of earthly happiness is pride, to oppose which came the
lowliness of Christ, rebuking those whom He wished by lowliness to make the children of
the Most High, and blaming them: “I said, Ye are gods, ye are all the children of the Most
High” (ver. 6). “But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes” (ver. 7). Whether

to those He said this, “I said, Ye are gods,” and to those particularly who are unpredestined
to eternal life; and to the other, “But ye shall die like men,” etc., “and shall fall like one of
the princes,” in this way also distinguishing the gods; or whether He blames all together, in
order to distinguish the obedient and those who received correction, “I said, Ye are gods,
and ye are all the children of the Most High:” that is, to all of you I promised celestial hap-
piness, “but ye,” through the infirmity of your flesh, “shall die like men,” and through
haughtiness of soul, “like one of the princes,” that is, the devil, shall not be exalted, but “shall
fall.” As if He said: Though the days of your life are so few, that ye speedily die like men,
this avails not to your correction: but like the devil, whose days are many in this world, be-
cause he dies not in the flesh, ye are lifted up so that ye fall. For by devilish pride it came to
pass that the perverse and blind rulers of the Jews envied the glory of Christ: by this will it
came to pass, and still does, that the lowliness of Christ crucified unto death is lightly es-
teemed in the eyes of them who love the excellence of this world.
5. And therefore that this vice may be cured, in the person of the Prophet himself it is
said, “Arise, O God, and judge the earth” (ver. 8); for the earth swelled high when it crucified
Thee: rise from the dead, and judge the earth. “For Thou shalt destroy among all nations.”
What, but the earth? that is, destroying those who savour of earthly things, or destroying
the feeling itself of earthly lust and pride in believers; or separating those who do not believe,
as earth to be trodden under foot and to perish. Thus by His members, whose conversation
is in heaven, He judges the earth, and destroys it among all nations. But I must not omit to
remark, that some copies have, “for Thou shalt inherit among all nations.” This too may be
understood agreeably to the sense, nor does anything prevent both meanings existing at
once. His inheritance takes place by love, which in that He cultivates by His commands and
gracious mercy, He destroys earthly desires.
Psalm LXXXII
Psalm LXXXIII.3847
1. Of this Psalm the title is, “A song of a Psalm of Asaph.” We have already often said
what is the interpretation of Asaph, that is, congregation. That man, therefore, who was
called Asaph, is named in representation of the congregation of God’s people in the titles
of many Psalms. But in Greek, congregation is called synagogue, which has come to be held
for a kind of proper name for the Jewish people, that it should be called The Synagogue;
even as the Christian people is more usually called The Church, in that it too is congregated.
2. The people of God, then, in this Psalm saith, “O God, who shall be like unto Thee?”
(ver. 1). Which I suppose to be more fitly taken of Christ, because, being made in the likeness
of men,3848 He was thought by those by whom He was despised to be comparable to other
men: for He was even “reckoned among the unrighteous,”3849 but for this purpose, that He
might be judged. But when He shall come to judge, then shall be done what is here said, “O
God, who is like unto Thee?” For if the Psalms did not use to speak to the Lord Christ, that
too would not be spoken which not one of the faithful can doubt was spoken unto Christ.
“Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy
kingdom.”3850 To him therefore also now it is said, “O God, who shall be like unto Thee?”
For unto many Thou didst vouchsafe to be likened in Thy humiliation, even so far as to the
robbers that were crucified with Thee: but when in glory Thou shalt come, “who shall be
like unto Thee?”…
3. “For lo Thine enemies have sounded, and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head”
(ver. 2). He seems to me to signify the last days, when these things that are now repressed
by fear are to break forth into free utterance, but quite irrational, so that it should rather be
called a “sound,” than speech or discourse. They will not, therefore, then begin to hate, but
“they that hate Thee” will then “lift up the head.” And not “heads,” but “head;” since they
are to come even to that point, that they shall have that head, which “is lifted up above all
that is called God, and that is worshipped;”3851 so that in him especially is to be fulfilled,
“He that exalteth himself shall be abased;”3852 and when He to whom it is said, “Keep not
silence, nor grow mild, O God,” shall “slay him with the breath of His mouth, and shall
destroy with the brightness of His coming.”3853 “Upon Thy people they have malignantly
taken counsel” (ver. 3). Or, as other copies have it, “They have cunningly devised counsel,

and have devised against Thy saints.” In scorn this is said. For how should they be able to
hurt the nation or people of God, or His saints, who know how to say, “If God be for us,
who shall be against us?”3854
4. “They have said, Come, and let us destroy them from a nation” (ver. 4). He has put
the singular number for the plural: as it is said, “Whose is this cattle,” even though the
question be of a flock, and the meaning “these cattle.” Lastly, other copies have “from na-
tions,” where the translators have rather followed the sense than the word. “Come, and let
us destroy them from a nation.” This is that sound whereby they “sounded” rather than
spake, since they did vainly make a noise with vain sayings. “And let it not be mentioned
of the name of Israel any more.” This others have expressed more plainly, “and let there not
be remembrance of the name of Israel any more.” Since, “let it be mentioned of the name”
(memoretur nominis), is an unusual phrase in the Latin language; for it is rather customary
to say, “let the name be mentioned” (memoretur nomen); but the sense is the same. For he
who said, “let it be mentioned of the name,” translated the Greek phrase. But Israel must
here be understood in fact of the seed of Abraham, to which the Apostle saith, “Therefore
ye are the seed of Abraham, according to the promise heirs.”3855 Not Israel according to
the flesh, of which he saith, “Behold Israel after the flesh.”
5. “Since they have imagined with one consent; together against Thee have they disposed
a testament” (ver. 5): as though they could be the stronger. In fact, “a testament” is a name
given in the Scriptures not only to that which is of no avail till the death of the testators, but
every covenant and decree they used to call a testament. For Laban and Jacob made a testa-
ment,3856 which was certainly to have force between the living; and such cases without
number are read in the words of God. Then he begins to make mention of the enemies of
Christ, under certain proper names of nations; the interpretation of which names sufficiently
indicates what he would have to be understood. For by such names are most suitably figured
the enemies of the truth. “Idumæans,” for instance, are interpreted either “men of blood,”
or “of earth.” “Ismaelites,” are “obedient to themselves,” and therefore not to God, but to
themselves. “Moab,” “from the father;” which in a bad sense has no better explanation, than
by considering it so connected with the actual history, that Lot, a father, by the illicit inter-
course procured by his daughter, begat him; since it was from that very circumstance he
was so named.3857 Good, however, was his father, but as “the Law is good if one use it law-
fully,”3858 not impurely and unlawfully. “Hagarens,” proselytes, that is strangers, by which

Psalm LXXXIII
name also are signified, among the enemies of God’s people, not those who become citizens,
but those who persevere in a foreign and alien mind, and when an opportunity of doing
harm occurs, show themselves. “Gebal,” “a vain valley,” that is, humble in pretence. “Amon,”
“an unquiet people,” or “a people of sadness.” “Amalech,” “a people licking;” whence else-
where it is said, “and his enemies shall lick the earth.”3859 The “alien race,” though by their
very name in Latin, they sufficiently show themselves to be aliens, and for this cause of
course enemies, yet in the Hebrew are called “Philistines,” which is explained, “falling from
drink,” as of persons made drunken by worldly luxury. “Tyre” in Hebrew is called Sor; which
whether it be interpreted straitness or tribulation, must be taken in the case of these enemies
of God’s people in that sense, of which the Apostle speaks, “Tribulation and straitness on
every soul of man that doeth evil.”3860 All these are thus enumerated in the Psalms: “The
tabernacles of the Edomites, Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarenes, Gebal, and Amon, and
Amalech, and the Philistines with those who inhabit Tyre.”
6. And as if to point out the cause why they are enemies of God’s people, he adds, “For
Assur came with them.” Now Assur is often used figuratively for the devil, “who works in
the children of disobedience,”3861 as in his own vessels, that they may assail the people of
God. “They have holpen the children of Lot,” he saith: for all enemies, by the working in
them of the devil, their prince, “have holpen the children of Lot,” who is explained to mean
“one declining.” But the apostate angels are well explained as the children of declension, for
by declining from truth they swerved to become followers of the devil. These are they of
whom the Apostle speaks: “Ye wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities
and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
places.”3862 Those invisible3863 enemies are holpen then by unbelieving men, in whom they
work in order to assail the people of God.
7. Now let us see what the prophetic spirit prays may fall upon them, rather foretelling
than cursing. “Do thou to them,” he saith, “as unto Madian and Sisera, as unto Jabin at the
brook of Kishon” (ver. 9). “They perished at Endor, they became as the dung of the earth”
(ver. 10). All these, the history relates, were subdued and conquered by Israel, which then
was the people of God: as was the case also with those whom he next mentions: “Make their
princes like Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana” (ver. 11). The meaning of these names
is as follows: Madian is explained a perverted judgment: Sisera, shutting out of joy: Jabin,
wise.3864 But in these enemies conquered by God’s people is to be understood that wise

3862 Eph. vi. 12.

3864 Judg. iv. 7, 8.
Psalm LXXXIII
man of whom the Apostle speaketh, “Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the
disputer of this world?”3865 Oreb is dryness, Zeb, wolf, Zebee, a victim, namely of the wolf;
for he too has his victims; Salmana, shadow of commotion. All these agree to the evils which
the people of God conquer by good. Moreover Kishon, the torrent in which they were
conquered, is explained, their hardness. Endor, where they perished, is explained, the
Fountain of generation, but of the carnal generation namely, to which they were given up,
and therefore perished, not heeding the regeneration which leadeth unto life, where they
shall neither marry nor be given in marriage,3866 for they shall die no more. Rightly then it
is said of these: “they became as the dung of the earth,” in that nothing was produced of
them but fruitfulness of the earth. As then all these were in figure conquered by the people
of God, as figures, so he prays that those other enemies may be conquered in truth.
8. “All their princes, who said, Let us take to ourselves the sanctuary of God in possession”
(ver. 12). This is that vain noise, with which, as said above, Thy enemies have made a mur-
muring. But what must be understood by “the sanctuary of God,” except the temple of God?
as saith the Apostle: “For the temple of God is holy,3867 which temple ye are.”3868 For what
else do the enemies aim at, but to take into possession, that is, to make subject to themselves
the temple of God, that it may give in to their ungodly wills?
9. But what follows? “My God, make them like unto a wheel” (ver. 13). This is fitly taken
as meaning that they should be constant in nothing that they think; but I think it may also
be rightly explained, make them like unto a wheel, because a wheel is lifted up on the part
of what is behind,3869 is thrown down on the part of what is in front; and so it happens to
all the enemies of the people of God. For this is not a wish, but a prophecy. He adds: “as the
stubble in the face of the wind.” By face he means presence; for what face hath the wind,
which has no bodily features, being only a motion, in that it is a kind of wave of air? But it
is put for temptation, by which light and vain hearts are hurried away.
10. This levity, by which consent is easily given to what is evil, is followed by severe
torment; therefore he proceeds:—
“Like as the fire that burneth up the wood, and as the flame that consumeth the moun-
tains” (ver. 14): “so shalt Thou persecute them with Thy tempest, and in Thy anger shalt
disturb them” (ver. 15). Wood, he saith, for its barrenness, mountains for their loftiness;
for such are the enemies of God’s people, barren of righteousness, full of pride. When he
says, “fire” and “flame,” he means to repeat under another term, the idea of God judging

3867 Sanctum.
3868 1 Cor. iii. 17.
3869 Ex his quæ retrò sunt extollitur, ex his quæ ante sunt dejicitur.
Psalm LXXXIII
and punishing. But in saying, “with Thy tempest,” he means, as he goes on to explain, “Thy
anger:” and the former expression, “Thou shalt persecute,” answers to, “Thou shalt disturb.”
We must take care, however, to understand, that the anger of God is free from any turbulent
emotion; for His anger is an expression for His just method of taking vengeance: as the law
might be said to be angry when its ministers are moved to punish by its sanction.
11. “Fill their faces with shame, and they shall seek Thy name, O Lord” (ver. 16). Good
and desirable is this which he prophesieth for them: and he would not prophesy thus, unless
there were even in that company of the enemies of God’s people, some men of such kind
that this would be granted to them before the last judgment: for now they are mixed together,
and this is the body of the enemies, in respect of the envy whereby they rival the people of
God. And now, where they can, they make a noise and lift up their head: but severally, not
universally as they will do at the end of the world, when the last judgment is about to fall.
But it is the same body, even in those who out of this number shall believe and pass into
another body (for the faces of these are filled with shame, that they may seek the name of
the Lord), as well as in those others who persevere unto the end in the same wickedness,
who are made as stubble before the wind, and are consumed like a wood and barren
mountains. To these he again returns, saying, “They shall blush and be vexed for ever and
ever” (ver. 17). For those are not vexed for ever and ever who seek the name of the Lord,
but having respect unto the shame of their sins, they are vexed for this purpose, that they
may seek the name of the Lord, through which they may be no more vexed.
12. Again, he returns to these last, who in the same company of enemies are to be made
ashamed for this purpose, that they may not be ashamed for ever: and for this purpose to
be destroyed in as far as they are wicked, that being made good they may be found alive for
ever. For having said of them, “Let them be ashamed and perish,” he instantly adds, “and
let them know that Thy name is the Lord, Thou art only the Most Highest in all the earth”
(ver. 18). Coming to this knowledge, let them be so confounded as to please God: let them
so perish, as that they may abide. “Let them know,” he says, “that Thy name is the Lord:”
as if whoever else are called lords are named so not truly but by falsehood, for they rule but
as servants, and compared with the true Lord are not lords; as it is said, I Am that I Am:3870
as if those things which are made are not, compared with Him by whom they are made. He
adds, “Thou only art the Most Highest in all the earth:” or, as other copies have it, “over all
the earth;” as it might be said, in all the heaven, or over all the heaven: but he used the latter
word in preference, to depress the pride of earth. For earth ceaseth to be proud, that is, man
ceaseth, to whom it was said, “Thou art dust;” 3871 and “why is earth and ashes proud?”3872

3873 Rom. viii. 28, 31.
Psalm LXXXIII
Psalm LXXXIV.3874
1. This Psalm is entitled, “For the winepresses.” And, as you observed with me, my be-
loved (for I saw that you attended most closely), nothing is said in its text either of any press,
or wine-basket, or vat, or of any of the instruments or the building of a winepress; nothing
of this kind did we hear read; so that it is no easy question what is the meaning of this title
inscribed upon it, “for the winepresses.” For certainly, if after the title it mentioned anything
about such things as I enumerated, carnal persons might have believed that it was a song
concerning those visible wine-presses; but as it has this title, yet says nothing afterwards of
those winepresses which we know so well, I cannot doubt that there are other wine-presses,
which the Spirit of God intended us to look for and to understand here. Therefore, let us
recall to mind what takes place in these visible winepresses, and see how this takes place
spiritually in the Church. The grape hangs on the vines, and the olive on its trees. For it is
for these two fruits that presses are usually made ready; and as long as they hang on their
boughs, they seem to enjoy free air; and neither is the grape wine, nor the olive oil, before
they are pressed. Thus it is with men whom God predestined before the world to be con-
formed to the image of His only-begotten Son,3875 who has been first and especially pressed
in His Passion, as the great Cluster. Men of this kind, therefore, before they draw near to
the service of God, enjoy in the world a kind of delicious liberty, like hanging grapes or
olives: but as it is said, “My son, when thou drawest near to the service of God, stand in
judgment and fear, and make thy soul ready for temptation:”3876 so each, as he draweth
near to the service of God, findeth that he is come to the winepress; he shall undergo tribu-
lation, shall be crushed, shall be pressed, not that he may perish in this world, but that he
may flow down into the storehouses of God. He hath the coverings of carnal desires stripped
off from him, like grape-skins: for this hath taken place in him in carnal desires, of which
the Apostle speaks, “Put ye off the old man, and put on the new man.” 3877 All this is not
done but by pressure: therefore the Churches of God of this time are called winepresses.
2. But who are we who are placed in the wine-presses? “Sons of Core.” For this follows:
“For the winepresses, to the sons of Core.” The sons of Core has been explained, sons of the
bald: as far as those could explain it to us, who know that language, according to their service
due to God.3878…
3. But being placed under pressure, we are crushed for this purpose, that for our love
by which we were borne towards those worldly, secular, temporal, unstable, and perishable

Psalm LXXXIV
things, having suffered in them, in this life, torments, and tribulations of pressures, and
abundance of temptations, we may begin to seek that rest which is not of this life, nor of
this earth; and the Lord becomes, as is written, “a refuge for the poor man.” 3879 What is,
“for the poor man”? For him who is, as it were, destitute, without aid, without help, without
anything on which he may rest, in earth. For to such poor men, God is present. For though
men abound in money on earth,…they are filled more with fear than with enjoyment. For
what is so uncertain as a rolling thing? It is not unfitly that money itself is stamped round,
because it remains not still. Such men, therefore, though they have something, are yet poor.
But those who have none of this wealth, but only desire it, are counted also among rich men
who will be rejected; for God takes account not of power, but of will. The poor then are
destitute of all this world’s substance, for even though it abounds around them, they know
how fleeting it is; and crying unto God, having nothing in this world with which they may
delight themselves, and be held down, placed in abundant pressures and temptations, as if
in winepresses, they flow down, having become oil or wine. What are these latter but good
desires? For God remains their only object of desire; now they love not earth. For they love
Him who made heaven and earth; they love Him, and are not yet with Him. Their desire is
delayed, in order that it may increase; it increases, in order that it may receive. For it is not
any little thing that God will give to him who desires, nor does he need to be little exercised
to be made fit to receive so great a good: not anything which He hath made will God give,
but Himself who made all things. Exercise thyself to receive God: that which thou shalt have
for ever, desire thou for a long time.…
4. Wherefore, most beloved, as each can, make vows, and perform to the Lord God3880
what each can: let no one look back, no one delight himself with his former interests, no
one turn away from that which is before to that which is behind: let him run until he arrive:
for we run not with the feet but with the desire. But let no one in this life say that he hath
arrived. For who can be so perfect as Paul?3881 Yet he saith, “Brethren, I count not myself
to have attained.”
5. If therefore thou feelest the passions of this world, even when thou art happy, thou
understandest now that thou art in the winepress.…If therefore the world smile upon thee
with happiness, imagine thyself in the winepress, and say, “I found trouble and heaviness,
and I did call upon the name of the Lord.”3882 He said not, I found trouble, without meaning,
of such a kind as was hidden: for some troubles are hidden from some in this world, who
think they are happy while they are absent from God. “For as long as we are in the body,”

he saith, “we are absent from the Lord.”3883 If thou wert absent from thy father, thou
wouldest be unhappy: art thou absent from the Lord, and happy? There are then some who
think it is well with them. But those who understand, that in whatever abundance of wealth
and pleasures, though all things obey their beck, though nothing troublesome creep in,
nothing adverse terrify, yet that they are in a bad case as long as they are absent from the
Lord; with a most keen eye these have found trouble, and grief, and have called on the name
of the Lord. Such is he who sings in this Psalm. Who is he? The Body of Christ. Who is that?
You, if you will: all we, if we will: for Christ’s Body is one.…
“How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts” (ver. 1). He was in some tabernacles,
that is, in winepresses: but he longed for other tabernacles, where is no pressure: in this he
sighed for them, from these, he, as it were, flowed down into them by the channel of longing
desire.
6. And what follows? “My soul longeth and faileth for the courts of the Lord” (ver. 2).
It is not enough that it “longeth and faileth:” for what doth it fail? “For the courts of the
Lord.” The grape when pressed hath failed: but for what? So as to be changed into wine, and
to flow into the vat, and into the rest of the storeroom, to be kept there in great quiet. Here
it is longed for, there it is received: here are sighs, there joy: here prayers, there praises: here
groans, there rejoicing. Those things which I mentioned, let no one while here turn from
ashamed: let no one be unwilling to suffer. There is danger, lest the grape, while it fears the
winepress, should be devoured by birds or by wild beasts.…
7. Thou hast heard a groan in the winepress, “My soul longeth and faileth for the courts
of the Lord:” hear how it holdeth out, rejoicing in hope: “My heart and my flesh have rejoiced
in the living God.” Here they have rejoiced for that cause. Whence cometh rejoicing, but of
hope? Wherefore have they rejoiced? “In the living God.” What has rejoiced in thee? “My
heart and my flesh.” Why have they rejoiced? “For,” saith he, “the sparrow hath found her
a house, and the turtle-dove a nest, where she may lay her young” (ver. 3). What is this? He
had named two things, and he adds two figures of birds which answer to them: he had said
that his heart rejoiced and his flesh, and to these two he made the sparrow and turtle-dove
to correspond: the heart as the sparrow, the flesh as the dove. The sparrow hath found herself
a home: my heart hath found itself a home. She tries her wings in the virtues of this life, in
faith, and hope, and charity, by which she may fly unto her home: and when she shall have
come thither, she shall remain; and now the complaining voice of the sparrow, which is
here, shall no longer be there. For it is the very complaining sparrow of whom in another
Psalm he saith, “Like a sparrow alone on the housetop.”3884 From the housetop he flies
home. Now let him be on the housetop, treading on his carnal house: he shall have a heavenly
3883 2 Cor. v. 6.
3884 Ps. cii. 7.
Psalm LXXXIV
house, a perpetual home: that sparrow shall make an end of his complaints. But to the dove
he hath given young, that is, to the flesh: “the dove hath found a nest, where she may lay
her young.” The sparrow a home, the dove a nest, and a nest too where she may lay her
young. A home is chosen as for ever, a nest is framed for a time: with the heart we think
upon God, as if the sparrow flew to her home: with the flesh we do good works. For ye see
how many good works are done by the flesh of the saints; for by this we work the things we
are commanded to work, by which we are helped in this life. “Break thy bread to the hungry,
and bring the poor and roofless into thy house; and if thou see one naked, clothe him:”3885
and other such things which are commanded us we work only through the flesh.…We speak,
brethren, what ye know: how many seem to do good works without the Church?3886 how
many even Pagans feed the hungry, clothe the naked, receive the stranger, visit the sick,
comfort the prisoner? how many do this? The dove seems, as it were, to bring forth young:
but finds not herself a nest. How many works may heretics do not in the Church; they place
not their young in a nest. They shall be trampled on and crushed: they shall not be kept,
shall not be guarded.…In that faith lay thy young: in that nest work thy works. For what
the nests are, what that nest is, follows at once. Having said, And the dove hath found herself
a nest, where she may lay her young; as if thou hadst asked, What nest? “Thy altars, O Lord
of Hosts, my King and my God.” What is, “My King and my God?” Thou who rulest me,
who hast created me.
8. …“Blessed are those who dwell in Thy house” (ver. 4).…If thou hast thy own house,
thou art poor; if God’s, thou art rich. In thy own house thou wilt fear robbers; of the house
of God, He is Himself the wall. Therefore “blessed are those who dwell in Thy house.” They
possess the heavenly Jerusalem, without constraint, without pressure, without difference
and division of boundaries; all have it, and each have all. Great are those riches. Brother
crowdeth not brother: there is no want there. Next, what will they do there? For among men
it is necessity which is the mother of all employments. I have already said, in brief, brethren,
run in your mind through any occupations, and see if it is not necessity alone which produces
them. Those very eminent arts which seem so powerful in giving help to others, the art of
speaking in their defence or of medicine in healing, for these are the most excellent employ-
ments in this life; take away litigants, who is there for the advocate to help? take away wounds
and diseases? what is there for the physician to cure? And all those employments of ours
which are required and done for our daily life, arise from necessity. To plough, to sow, to
clear fallow ground, to sail; what is it which produces all these works, but necessity and
want? Take away hunger, thirst, nakedness; who has need of all these things?…For instance,
3885 Isa. lviii. 7.
3886 Ed. Ben. refers to P. Lombard, II. Sent. Dist. 41, where this passage is quoted on the question, “Are all
the works of those who are without faith evil?” [See A.N.F. vol. ii. p. 517, note 4.—C.]
Psalm LXXXIV
the injunction, “Break thy bread to the hungry.” For whom could you break bread, if there
were nobody hungry? “Take in the roofless poor into thy house.”3887 What stranger is there
to take in, where all live in their own country? What sick person to visit, where they enjoy
perpetual health? What litigants to reconcile, where there is everlasting peace? What dead
to bury, where there is eternal life? None of those honourable actions which are common
to all men will then be your employment, nor any of these good works; the young swallows
will then fly out of their nest. What then? You have said already what we shall have; “Those
who dwell in Thy house are blessed.” Say now what they shall do, for I see not then any need
to induce me to action. Even what I am now saying and arguing springs from some need.
Will there be any such argument there to teach the ignorant, or remind the forgetful? Or
will the Gospel be read in that country where the Word of God Itself shall be contem-
plated?…“They shall be always praising Thee.” This shall be our whole duty, an unceasing
Hallelujah. Think not, my brethren, that there will be any weariness there: if ye are not able
to endure long here in saying this, it is because3888 some want draws you away from that
enjoyment. If what is not seen gives not so much joy here, if with so much eagerness under
the pressure and weakness of the flesh we praise that which we believe, how shall we praise
that which we see? “When death shall be swallowed up in victory, when this mortal shall
have put on immortality,”3889 no one will say, “I have been standing a long time;” no one
will say, “I have fasted a long time,” “I have watched a long time.” For there shall be great
endurance, and our immortal bodies shall be sustained in contemplation of God. And if the
word which we now dispense to you keeps your weak flesh standing so long, what will be
the effect of that joy? how will it change us? “For we shall be like Him, since we shall see
Him as He is.” 3890 Being made like Him, when shall we ever faint? what shall draw us off?
Brethren, we shall never be satiated with the praise of God, with the love of God. If love
could fail, praise could fail. But if love be eternal, as there will there be beauty inexhaustible,
fear not lest thou be not able to praise for ever Him whom thou shalt be able to love for ever.
For this life let us sigh.
9. But how shall we come thither? “Happy is the man whose strength is in Thee” (ver.
5). He knew where he was, and that by reason of the frailty of his flesh he could not fly to
that state of blessedness: he thought upon his own burden, as it is said elsewhere; “For the
corruptible body weighs down the soul, and the earthly house depresses the understanding
which has many thoughts.” 3891 The Spirit calls upward, the weight of the flesh calls back

Psalm LXXXIV
again downward: between the double effort to raise and to weigh down, a kind of struggle
ensues: this struggle goes toward the pressure of the winepress. Hear how the Apostle de-
scribes this same struggle of the winepress, for he was himself afflicted there, there he was
pressed.…“Miserable man that I am: who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The
grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”3892…“For I delight in the Law of God according
to the inner man.” But what shall I do? how shall I fly? how shall I arrive thither? “I see an-
other law in my members,” etc.…And as in the words of the Apostle, that difficulty and that
almost inextricable struggle is alleviated by the addition, “The grace of God through Jesus
Christ our Lord;” so here, when he sighed in the ardent longing for the house of God, and
those praises of God, and when a kind of despair arose at the feeling of the burden of the
body and the weight of the flesh, again he awoke to hope, and said (ver. 5), “Blessed is the
man whose taking up3893 is in Thee.”
10. What then does God supply by His grace to him whom He taketh hold of to lead
him on? He goes on to say: “He hath placed steps3894 in his heart.”…Where does it place
steps? “In his heart, in the valley of weeping” (ver. 6). So here thou hast for a winepress the
valley of weeping, the very pious tears in tribulation are the new wine of those that
love.…They went forth “weeping,” he says, “casting their seed.”3895 Therefore, by the grace
of God may upward steps be placed in thy heart. Rise by loving. Hence the Psalm “of degrees”
is called.…“He hath placed steps of ascent to the place which He hath appointed” (ver. 7).
Now we lament; whence proceed our lamentations, but from that place where the steps of
our ascent are placed? Whence comes our lamentation, but from that cause wherefore the
Apostle exclaimed that he was a wretched man, because he saw another law in his members,
warring against the law in his mind?3896 And whence does this proceed? From the penalty
of sin. And we thought that we could easily be righteous as it were by our own strength,
before we received the command; “but when the command came, sin revived; but I died,”3897
saith the Apostle. For a law was given to men, not such as could save them at once, but it
was to show them in what severe sickness they were lying.…But when sin was made manifest
by the law given, sin was but increased, for it is both sin, and against the Law; “Sin,” saith
he, “taking occasion by the command, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.”3898
What does he mean by “taking occasion by the law”? Having received the command, men

tried as by their own strength to obey it; conquered by lust, they became guilty of transgres-
sion of this very command also. But what saith the Apostle? “Where sin abounded, grace
hath much more abounded;”3899 that is, the disease increased, the medicine became of more
avail. Accordingly, my brethren, did those five porches of Solomon, in the middle of which
the pool lay, heal the sick at all? The sick, says the Evangelist, lay in the five porches.3900 In
the Gospel we have and read it. Those five porches are the law in the five books of Moses.
For this cause the sick were brought forth from their houses that they might lie in the porches.
So the law brought the sick men forth, but did not heal them: but by the blessing of God the
water was disturbed, as by an Angel descending into it. At the sight of the water troubled,
the one person who was able, descended and was healed. That water surrounded by the five
porches, was the people of the Jews shut up in their law. The Lord came and disturbed this
people, so that He Himself was slain. For if the Lord had not troubled the Jews by coming
down to them, would He have been crucified? So that the troubled water signified the Passion
of the Lord, which arose from His troubling the Jewish people. The sick man who believeth
in this Passion, like him who descended into the troubled water, is healed thereby. He whom
the Law could not heal, that is, while he lay in the porches, is healed by grace, by faith in the
Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ.…
11. “He shall give blessing,” saith he, “who gave the law.”…Grace shall come after the
law, grace itself is the blessing. And what has that grace and blessing given unto us? “They
shall go from virtue to virtue.” For here by grace many virtues are given. “For to one is given
by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge according to the same
Spirit, to another faith, to another the gift of healing, to another different kinds of tongues,
to another the interpretation of tongues, to another prophecy.”3901 Many virtues, but neces-
sary for this life; and from these virtues we go on to “a virtue.” To what “virtue”? To “Christ
the Virtue of God and the Wisdom of God.”3902 He giveth different virtues in this place,
who for all the virtues which are necessary and useful in this valley of weeping shall give
one virtue, Himself. For in Scripture and in many writers four virtues are described useful
for life: prudence, by which we discern between good and evil; justice, by which we give
each person his due, “owing no man anything,”3903 but loving all men: temperance, by
which we restrain lusts; fortitude, by which we bear all troubles. These virtues are now by
the grace of God given unto us in the valley of weeping: from these virtues we mount unto
that other virtue. And what will that be, but the virtue of the contemplation of God alone?…It

Psalm LXXXIV
follows in that place: “They shall go from virtue to virtue.” What virtue? That of contempla-
tion. What is contemplation? “The God of Gods shall appear in Sion.” The God of Gods,
Christ of the Christians.…When all is finished, that mortality makes necessary, He shall
appear to the pure in heart, as He is, “God with God,” The Word with the Father, “by which
all things were made.”
12. And again, from the thought of those joys he returns to his own sighs. He sees what
has come before in hope, and where he is in reality.…Therefore returning to the groans
proper to this place, he saith, “O Lord God of virtues, hear my prayer: hearken, O God of
Jacob” (ver. 8): for Jacob himself also Thou hast made Israel out of Jacob. For God appeared
unto him, and he was called Israel, 3904 seeing God. Hear me therefore, O God of Jacob,
and make me Israel. When shall I become Israel? When the God of Gods shall appear in
Sion.
13. “Behold, O God our defender. And look on the face of Thy Christ” (ver. 9). For when
doth God not look upon the face of His Christ? What is this, “Look on the face of Thy
Christ”? By the face we are known. What is it then, Look on the face of Thy Christ? Cause
Thy Christ to become known to all. Look on the face of Thy Christ: let Christ become known
to all, that we may be able to go from strength to strength, that grace may abound, since sin
hath abounded.
14. “For one day in Thy courts is better than a thousand” (ver. 10). Those courts they
were for which he sighed, for which he fainted. “My soul longeth and faileth for the courts
of the Lord:”3905 one day there is better than a thousand days. Men long for thousands of
days, and wish to live here long: let them despise these thousands of days, let them long for
one day, which has neither rising nor setting: one day, an everlasting day, to which no yes-
terday yields, which no to-morrow presses. Let this one day be longed for by us. What have
we to do with a thousand days? We go from the thousand days to one day; let us hasten to
that one day, 3906 as we go from strength to strength.
15. “I have chosen to be cast away in the house of the Lord, rather than to dwell in the
tents of sinners” (ver. 11). For he found the valley of weeping, he found humility by which
he might rise: he knoweth that if he would raise himself he shall fall, if he humble himself
he shall be exalted: he hath chosen to be cast away, that he may be raised up. How many
beside this tabernacle of the Lord’s winepress, that is beside the Catholic Church, wishing
to be lifted up, and loving their honours, refuse to see the truth. If this verse had been in
their heart, would they not cast away honours, and run to the valley of weeping, and hence
find in their heart the way of ascent, and hence go from virtues to virtue, placing their hope
3904 Gen. xxxii. 28.
3905 Ps. lxxxiv. 2.
3906 Oxf. mss. add, “let us hasten,” etc.
Psalm LXXXIV
in Christ, not in some man or another? A good word is this, a word to rejoice in, a word to
be chosen. He himself chose to be cast away in the house of the Lord; but He who invited
him to the feast, when he chose a lower place calleth him to a higher one, and saith unto
him, “Go up higher.”3907 Yet he chose not but to be in the house of the Lord, in any part of
it, so that he were not outside the threshold.
16. Wherefore did he choose?…“Because God loveth mercy and truth” (ver. 12). The
Lord loveth mercy, by which He first came to my help: He loveth truth, so as to give to him
that believeth what He has promised.3908 Hear in the case of the Apostle Paul, His mercy
and truth, Paul who was first Saul the persecutor. He needed mercy, and he has said that it
was shown towards him: “I who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
but I obtained mercy, that in me Christ Jesus might show forth all longsuffering towards
those who shall believe in Him unto life eternal.”3909 So that, when Paul received pardon
of such great crimes, no one should despair of any sins whatever being forgiven him. Lo!
Thou hast Mercy.…Lo, we see that Paul holdeth Him a debtor, having received mercy, de-
manding truth. The Lord, he says, shall give back in that day. What shall He give thee back,
but that which He oweth thee? How oweth He unto thee? What hast thou given Him? “Who
hath first given unto Him, and it shall be restored to him again.” 3910 The Lord Himself
hath made Himself a debtor, not by receiving, but by promising: it is not said unto Him,
Restore what Thou hast received: but, Restore what Thou hast promised. He hath shown
mercy unto me, he saith, that He might make me innocent: for before I was a blasphemer
and injurious: but by His grace I have been made innocent. But He who first showed mercy,
can He deny His debt? “He loveth mercy and truth. He will give grace and glory.” What
grace, but that of which the same one said: “By the grace of God I am what I am”?3911 What
glory, but that of which he said, “There is laid up for me a crown of glory”?3912
17. Therefore “the Lord will not withhold good from those who walk in innocence”
(ver. 12). Why then, O men, are ye unwilling to keep innocence, except in order that ye may
have good things?…Thou seest wealth in the hands of robbers, of the impious, the wicked,
the base; in the hands of scandalous and criminal men thou seest wealth: God giveth them
these things on account of their fellowship in the human race, for the abundant overflowing
of His goodness: who also “maketh His sun to rise upon the good and the evil, and causeth
it to rain upon the righteous and upon the sinners.”3913 Giveth He so much to the wicked,

and keepeth nothing for thee? He keepeth something: be at ease, He who had mercy on thee
when thou wast impious, doth He desert thee when thou hast become pious? He who gave
to the sinner the free gift of His Son’s death, what keepeth He for the saved through that
death? Therefore be at ease. Hold Him a debtor, for thou hast believed in Him promising.
What then remains for us here, in the winepress, in affliction, in hardship, in our present
dangerous life? What remains for us, that we may arrive thither? “O Lord God of virtues,
blessed is the man that putteth his hope in Thee.”
Psalm LXXXIV
Psalm LXXXV.3914
1. …Its title is, “A Psalm for the end, to the sons of Core.”3915 Let us understand no
other end than that of which the Apostle speaks: for, “Christ is the end of the law.”3916
Therefore when at the head of the title of the Psalm he placed the words, “for the end,” he
directed our heart to Christ. If we fix our gaze on Him, we shall not stray: for He is Himself
the Truth unto which we are eager to arrive, and He Himself the Way3917 by which we
run.…
2. The Prophet singeth to Him of the future, and useth words as it were of past time: he
speaks of things future as if already done, because with God that which is future has already
taken place.…“Lord, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land” (ver. 1); as if He had already
done so. “Thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.” His ancient people of Jacob, the
people of Israel, born of Abraham’s seed, in the promise to become one day the heir of God.
That was indeed a real people, to whom the Old Testament was given; but in the Old Testa-
ment the New was figured: that was the figure, this the truth expressed. In that figure, by a
kind of foretelling of the future, there was given to that people a certain land of promise, in
a region where the people of the Jews abode; where also is the city of Jerusalem, whose name
we have all heard of. When this people had received possession of this land, they suffered
many troubles from their neighbouring enemies who surrounded them: and when they
sinned against their God, they were given into captivity, not for destruction, but for discipline;
their Father not condemning, but scourging them. And after being seized on, they were set
free, and many times were both made captives, and set free; and they are now in captivity,
and that for a great sin, even because they crucified their Lord. What then are we to under-
stand them to mean by the words, “Thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob”?…This
Psalm hath prophesied in song. “Thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.” To whom
did it speak? To Christ; for it said, “for the end, for the sons of Core:” for He hath turned
away the captivity of Jacob. Hear Paul himself confessing: “O wretched man that I am, who
shall deliver me from the body of this death?” He asked who it should be, and straightway
it occurred to him, “The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”3918 Of this grace of
God the Prophet speaketh to our Lord Jesus Christ, “Thou hast turned away the captivity
of Jacob.” Attend to the captivity of Jacob, attend, and see that it is this: Thou hast turned
away our captivity, not by setting us free from the barbarians, with whom we had not met,
but by setting us free from bad works, from our sins, by which Satan held sway over us. For

Psalm LXXXV
if any one has been set free from his sins, the prince of sinners hath not whence he may hold
sway over him.
3. For how did He turn away the captivity of Jacob? See, how that that setting free is
spiritual, see how that it is done inwardly. “Thou hast forgiven,” he saith, “the iniquity of
Thy people: Thou hast covered all their sins” (ver. 2). Behold how He hath turned away
their captivity, in that He hath remitted iniquity: iniquity held them captive; thy iniquity
forgiven, thou art freed. Confess therefore that thou art in captivity, that thou mayest be
worthy to be freed: for he that knoweth not of his enemy, how can he invoke the liberator?
“Thou hast covered all their sins.” What is, “Thou hast covered”? So as not to see them.
How didst Thou not see them? So as not to take vengeance on them. Thou wast unwilling
to see our sins: and therefore sawest Thou them not, because Thou wouldest not see them:
“Thou hast covered all their sins.” “Thou hast appeased all Thy anger: Thou hast turned
Thyself from Thy wrathful indignation” (ver. 3).
4. And as these things are said of the future, though the sound of the words is past, it
follows: “Turn us, O God of our salvation” (ver. 4). That which he had just related as if it
were done, how prayeth he that it may be done, except because he wished to show that he
had spoken as if of the past in prophecy? But that it was not yet done which he had said was
done he showeth by this, that he prayeth that it may be done: “Turn us, O God of our salva-
tion, and turn away Thine anger from us.” Didst thou not say before: “Thou hast appeased
all Thy anger, Thou has turned Thyself from Thy wrathful indignation”? How then now
sayest thou, “And turn away Thine anger from us”? The Prophet answereth: These things
I speak of as done, because I see them about to be done: but because they are not yet done,
I pray that they may come, which I have already seen.
5. “Be not angry with us for ever” (ver. 5). For by the anger of God we are subject to
death, and by the anger of God we eat bread on this earth in want, and in the sweat of our
face.3919 This was Adam’s sentence when he sinned: and that Adam was every one of us,
for “in Adam all die;”3920 the sentence passed on him hath taken effect after him on us. For
we were not yet ourselves, but we were in Adam: therefore whatever happened to Adam
himself took effect on us also, so that we should die: for we all were in him.…So far as this
the sin of thy father hurts thee not, if thou hast changed thyself, even as it would not hurt
thy father if he had changed himself. But that which our stock hath received unto its subjec-
tion to death, it hath derived from Adam. What hath it so derived? That frailty of the flesh,
this torture of pains, this house of poverty, this chain of death, and snares of temptations;
all these things we carry about in this flesh; and this is the anger of God, because it is the
vengeance of God. But because it was so to be, that we should be regenerated, and by believing
3919 Gen. iii. 19.
3920 1 Cor. xv. 22.
Psalm LXXXV
should be made new, and all that mortality was to be removed in our resurrection, and the
whole man was to be restored in newness; “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all
be made alive;”3921 seeing this the Prophet saith, “Be not angry with us for ever, nor stretch
out Thy wrath from one generation to another.” The first generation was mortal by Thy
wrath: the second generation shall be immortal by Thy mercy.…
6. “O God, Thou shalt turn us again, and make us alive” (ver. 6). Not as if we ourselves
of our own accord, without Thy mercy, turn unto Thee, and then Thou shalt make us alive:
but so that not only our being made alive is from Thee, but our very conversion, that we
may be made alive. “And Thy people shall rejoice in Thee.” To their own evil they shall rejoice
in themselves: to their own good they shall rejoice in Thee. For when they wished to have
joy of themselves, they found in themselves woe: but now because God is all our joy, he that
will rejoice securely, let him rejoice in Him who cannot perish. For why, my brethren, will
ye rejoice in silver? Either thy silver perisheth, or thou: and no one knows which first: yet
this is certain, that both shall perish; which first, is uncertain. For neither can man remain
here always, nor can silver remain here always: so too gold, so garments, so houses, so money,
so broad lands, so, lastly, this light itself. Be not thou willing then to rejoice in these: but
rejoice in that light which hath no setting: rejoice in that dawn which no yesterday precedes,
which no to-morrow follows. What light is that? “I,” saith He, “am the Light of the world.”3922
He who saith unto thee, “I am the Light of the world,” calls thee to Himself. When He calls
thee, He converts thee: when He converts thee, He healeth thee: when He hath healed thee,
thou shalt see thy Converter, unto whom it is said, “Show us Thy mercy, O Lord, and grant
us Thy salvation” (ver. 7): Thy salvation, that is, Thy Christ.3923 Happy is he unto whom
God showeth His mercy. He it is who cannot indulge in pride, unto whom God showeth
His mercy. For by showing him His salvation He persuadeth him that whatever good man
has, he hath not but from Him who is all our good. And when a man has seen that whatever
good he has he hath not from himself, but from his God; he sees that everything which is
praised in him is of the mercy of God, not of his own deserving; and seeing this, he is not
proud; not being proud, he is not lifted up; not lifting himself up, he falleth not; not falling,
he standeth; standing, he clingeth fast; clinging fast, he abideth; abiding, he enjoyeth, and
rejoiceth in the Lord his God. He who made him shall be unto him a delight: and his delight
no one spoileth, no one interrupteth, no one taketh away.…Therefore, what saith John in
his Epistle? “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall
be.”3924 Who would not rejoice, if suddenly while he was wandering abroad, ignorant of

his descent, suffering want, and in a state of misery and toil, it were announced, Thou art
the son of a senator: thy father enjoys an ample patrimony on your family estate; I bid thee
return to thy father: how would he rejoice, if this were said to him by some one whose
promise he could trust? One whom we can trust, an Apostle of Christ, hath come and said
to us, Ye have a father, ye have a country, ye have an inheritance. Who is that father? “Be-
loved, we are the sons of God.”3925…Therefore He3926 promised us to show Himself unto
us. Think, my brethren, what His beauty is. All those beautiful things which ye see, which
ye love, He made. If these are beautiful, what is He Himself? If these are great, how great is
He? Therefore from these things which we love here, let us the more long for Him: and
despising these things, let us love Him: that by that very love we may by faith purify our
hearts, and His vision, when it cometh, may find our heart purified. The light which shall
be shown unto us ought to find us whole: this is the work of faith now. This is what we have
spoken here: “And grant us Thy salvation:” grant us Thy Christ, that we may know Thy
Christ, see Thy Christ; not as the Jews saw Him and crucified Him, but as the Angels see
Him, and rejoice.
7. “I will hearken” (ver. 8). The Prophet spoke: God spoke within in him, and the world
made a noise without. Therefore, retiring for a little from the noise of the world, and turning
himself back upon himself, and from himself upon Him whose voice he heard within; sealing
up his ears, as it were, against the tumultuous disquietude of this life, and against the soul
weighed down by the corruptible body, and against the imagination, that through the earthly
tabernacle pressing down,3927 thinketh on many things,3928 he saith, “I will hearken what
the Lord God speaketh in me;” and he heard, what? “For He shall speak peace unto His
people.” The voice of Christ, then, the voice of God, is peace: it calleth unto peace. Ho! it
saith, whosoever are not yet in peace, love ye peace: for what can ye find better from Me
than peace? What is peace? Where there is no war. What is this, where there is no war?
Where there is no contradiction, where there is no resistance, nothing to oppose. Consider
if we are yet there: consider if there is not now a conflict with the devil, if all the saints and
faithful ones wrestle not with the prince of demons. And how do they wrestle with him
whom they see not? They wrestle with their own desires, by which he suggests unto them
sins: and by not consenting to what he suggests, though they are not conquered, yet they
fight. Therefore there is not yet peace where there is fighting.…Whatever we provide for
our refreshment, there again we find weariness. Art thou hungry? one asks thee: thou an-
swerest, I am. He places food before thee for thy refreshment; continue thou to use it, for

Psalm LXXXV
thou hadst need of it; yet in continuing that which thou needest for refreshment, therein
findest thou weariness. By long sitting thou wast tired; thou risest and refreshest thyself by
walking; continue that relief, and by much walking thou art wearied; again thou wouldest
sit down. Find me anything by which thou art refreshed, wherein if thou continue thou dost
not again become weary. What peace then is that which men have here, opposed by so many
troubles, desires, wants, wearinesses? This is no true, no perfect peace. What will be perfect
peace? “This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortal-
ity.”3929…Persevere in eating much; this itself will kill thee: persevere in fasting much, by
this thou wilt die: sit continually, being resolved not to rise up, by this thou wilt die: be always
walking so as never to take rest, by this thou wilt die; watch continually, taking no sleep, by
this thou wilt die; sleep continually, never watching, thus too thou wilt die. When therefore
death shall be swallowed up in victory, these things shall no longer be: there will be full and
eternal peace. We shall be in a City, of which, brethren, when I speak I find it hard to leave
off, especially when offences wax common. Who would not long for that City whence no
friend goeth out, whither no enemy entereth,3930 where is no tempter, no seditious person,
no one dividing God’s people, no one wearying the Church in the service of the devil; since
the prince himself of all such is cast into eternal fire, and with him those who consent unto
him, and who have no will to retire from him? There shall be peace made pure in the sons
of God, all loving one another, seeing one another full of God, since God shall be all in
all.3931 We shall have God as our common object of vision, God as our common possession,
God as our common peace. For whatever there is which He now giveth unto us, He Himself
shall be unto us instead of His gifts; this will be full and perfect peace. This He speaketh
unto His people: this it was which he would hearken unto who said, “I will hearken what
the Lord God will say unto me: for He shall speak peace unto His people, and to His saints,
and unto those who turn their hearts unto Him.” Lo, my brethren, do ye wish that unto you
should belong that peace which God uttereth? Turn your heart unto Him: not unto me, or
unto that one, or unto any man. For whatever man would turn unto himself the hearts of
men, he falleth with them. Which is better, that thou fall with him unto whom thou turnest
thyself, or that thou stand with Him with whom thou turnest thyself? Our joy, our peace,
our rest, the end of all troubles, is none but God: blessed are “they that turn their hearts
unto Him.”
8. “Nevertheless, His salvation is nigh them that fear Him” (ver. 9). There were some
even then who feared Him in the Jewish people. Everywhere throughout the earth idols

Psalm LXXXV
were worshipped: devils were feared, not God: in that nation God was feared. But why was
He feared? In the Old Testament He was feared, lest He should give them up to captivity,
lest He should take away their land from them, lest He should destroy their vines with hail,
lest He should make their wives barren, lest He should take away their children from them.
For these carnal promises of God captivated their minds, which as yet were of small growth,
and for these things God was feared: but He was near unto them who even for these things
feared Him. The Pagan prayed for land to the devil: the Jew prayed for land to God: it was
the same thing which they prayed for, but not the same to whom they prayed. The latter,
though seeking what the Pagan sought, yet was distinguished from the Pagan; for he sought
it of Him who had made all things. And God, who was far3932 from the Gentiles, was near3933
unto them: yet He had regard even to those who were afar off, and to those who were near,
as the Apostle said: “And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to
them that were near.”3934 Whom did He mean by those near? The Jews, because they3935
worshipped one God. Whom by those who were afar off? The Gentiles, because they had
left Him by whom they were made and worshipped things which themselves had made. For
it is not in space that any one is far from God, but in affections. Thou lovest God, thou art
near unto Him. Thou hatest God, thou art far off. Thou art standing in the same place, both
while thou art near and far off. This it was, my brethren, which the Prophet had regard to:
although he saw the mercy of God extending over all, yet he saw something especial and
peculiar shown toward the Jews, and he saith, “Nevertheless, I will hearken what the Lord
God shall say unto me: for He shall speak peace unto His people;” and His people shall be,
not Judæa only, but it shall be gathered together out of all nations: “For He shall speak peace
unto His Saints, and to those who turn their hearts unto Him,” and to all who shall turn
their hearts unto Him from the whole world. “Nevertheless, His salvation shall be nigh them
that fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land:” that is, in that land in which the Prophet
was born, greater glory shall dwell, because Christ began to be preached from thence. Thence
were the Apostles, and thither first they were sent; from thence were the Prophets, there
first was the Temple, there sacrifice was made to God, there were the Patriarchs, there He
Himself came of the seed of Abraham, there Christ was manifested, there Christ appeared;
for from thence was the Virgin Mary who bore Christ. There He walked with His feet, there
He worked miracles. Thirdly, He ascribed so great honour to that nation, that when a certain
Canaanitish woman interrupted Him, praying for the healing of her daughter, He said unto
3932 Oxf. mss. “near,” “nearer.”

her, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”3936 Seeing this, the
Prophet saith, “that glory may dwell in our land.”
9. “Mercy and truth have met together” (ver. 10). “Truth in our land,” in a Jewish person,
“mercy” in the land of the Gentiles. For where was truth? Where the utterances of God were.
Where was mercy? On those who had left their God, and turned themselves unto devils.
Did He look down3937 also upon them? Yea, as if He said, Call those who are fugitives afar
off, who have departed far from Me: call them, let them find Me who seek them, since they
themselves would not seek Me. Therefore, “Mercy and truth have met together: righteousness
and peace have kissed each other.” Do righteousness, and thou shalt have peace; that right-
eousness and peace may kiss each other. For if thou love not righteousness, thou shalt not
have peace; for those two, righteousness and peace, love one another, and kiss one another:
that he who hath done righteousness may find peace kissing righteousness. They two are
friends: thou perhaps willest the one, and not the other: for there is no one who wills not
peace: but all will not work righteousness. Ask all men, Willest thou peace? With one mouth
the whole race of man answers thee, I wish, I desire, I will, I love it. Love also righteousness:
for these two, righteousness and peace, are friends; they kiss one another: if thou love not
the friend of peace, peace itself will not love thee, nor come unto thee. For what great thing
is it to desire peace? Every bad man longeth for peace. For peace is a good thing. But do
righteousness, for righteousness and peace kiss one another, they quarrel not together.…
10. “Truth hath sprung out of the earth, and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven” (ver. 11). “Truth hath sprung out of the earth:” Christ is born of a woman. The Son
of God hath come forth of the flesh. What is truth? The Son of God. What is the earth?
Flesh. Ask whence Christ was born, and thou seest that “Truth is sprung out of the earth.”
But the Truth which sprang out of the earth was before the earth, and by It the heaven and
the earth were made: but in order that righteousness might look down from heaven, that
is, in order that men might be justified by Divine grace, Truth was born of the Virgin Mary;
that He might be able to offer a sacrifice to justify them, the sacrifice of suffering, the sacrifice
of the Cross. And how could He offer a sacrifice for our sins, except He died? How could
He die, except He received from us that wherein He might die; that is, unless He received
from us mortal flesh, Christ could not have died: because the Word of God dieth not,
Godhead dieth not, the Virtue and Wisdom of God doth not die. How should He offer a
sacrifice, a healing victim, if He died not? How should He die, unless He clothed Himself
with flesh? How should He put on flesh, except truth sprang out of the earth?
11. On the same passage we may mention another meaning. “Truth is sprung out of the
earth:” confession from man. For thou, O man, wast a sinner. O earth, who when thou hadst
3936 Matt. xv. 24.
3937 Despexit; one ms. dispexit.
Psalm LXXXV
sinned didst hear the sentence, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,”3938 from
thee let truth spring, that righteousness may look down from heaven. How doth truth spring
from thee, whilst thou art a sinner, whilst thou art unrighteous? Confess thy sins, and truth
shall spring out of thee. For if whilst thou art unrighteous, thou callest thyself just, how can
truth spring out of thee? But if being unrighteous thou dost confess thyself to be so, “truth
hath sprung out of the earth.”…What “righteousness hath looked down from heaven”? It
is that of God, as though He said: Let us spare this man, for he spareth not himself: let us
pardon him, for he himself confesseth. He is changed so as to punish his sin: I too will
change, so as to set him free.
12. “For the Lord shall give sweetness, and our land shall give her increase” (ver. 12).…He
will give unto thee the sweetness of working righteousness, so that righteousness shall begin
to delight thee, whom before unrighteousness delighted: so that thou who at first didst delight
in drunkenness, shall rejoice in sobriety: and thou who didst at first rejoice in theft, so as to
take from another man what thou hadst not, shalt seek to give to him that hath not that
which thou hast: and thou who didst take delight in robbing, shalt delight now in giving:
thou whom shows delighted, shalt delight in prayer; thou who didst delight in trifling and
lascivious songs, shalt now delight in singing hymns to God; in running to church, thou
who at first didst run to the theatre. Whence is that sweetness born to thee, except from
this, that “God giveth sweetness”? For, behold, ye see what I mean: behold, I have spoken
unto you the word of God, I have sown seed in your devout hearts, finding your souls fur-
rowed, as it were, with the plough of confession: with devout attention ye have received the
seed; think now upon the word which ye have heard, like those who break up the clouds,
lest the fowls should carry away the seed, that what is sown may be able to spring up there:
and unless God rain upon it, what profits it that it is sown? This is what is meant by “our
land shall give her increase.” May He with His visitations, in leisure, in business, in your
house, in your bed, at meal-time, in conversation, in walks, visit your hearts, when we are
not by. May the rain of God come and make to sprout what is sown there: and when we are
not by, and are resting quietly, or otherwise employed, may God give increase to the seeds
which we have sown, that remarking afterwards your improved characters, we too may rejoice
for your fruit.
13. “For righteousness shall go before him, and he shall direct his steps in the way” (ver.
14): that righteousness, namely, which consists in confession of sins: for this is truth itself.
For thou oughtest to be righteous towards thyself, and to punish thyself: for this is the be-
ginning of man’s righteousness, that thou shouldest punish thyself, who art evil, and God
should make thee good. Therefore since this is the beginning of man’s righteousness, this
becomes a way for God, that God may come unto thee: there make for Him a way, in con-
3938 Gen. iii. 19.
Psalm LXXXV
fession of sins. Therefore John too, when he was baptizing in the water of repentance, and
would have men come to him repenting of their former deeds, spoke thus: “Prepare the way
of the Lord, make His paths straight.”3939 Thou didst please thyself in thy sins, O man: let
that which thou wast displease thee, that thou mayest be able to become what thou wast
not. Prepare the way of the Lord: let that righteousness go before, of confession of sins: He
will come and visit thee, for now He hath where to place His steps, He hath whereby He
may come to thee. Before thou didst confess thy sins, thou hadst shut up the way of God:
there was no way by which He might come unto thee. Confess thy past life, and thou
openest a way; and Christ shall come unto thee, and “shall place His steps in the way,” that
He may guide thee with His own footsteps.
3939 Matt. iii. 3
Psalm LXXXV
Psalm LXXXVI.3940
1. No greater gift could God have given to men than in making His Word, by which He
created all things, their Head, and joining them to Him as His members: that the Son of
God might become also the Son of man, one God with the Father, one Man with men; so
that when we speak to God in prayer for mercy, we do not separate the Son from Him; and
when the Body of the Son prays, it separates not its Head from itself: and it is one Saviour
of His Body, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who both prays for us, and prays in us,
and is prayed to by us. He prays for us, as our Priest; He prays in us, as our Head; He is
prayed to by us, as our God. Let us therefore recognise in Him our words, and His words
in us. Nor when anything is said of our Lord Jesus Christ, especially in prophecy, implying
a degree of humility below the dignity of God, let us hesitate to ascribe it to Him who did
not hesitate to join Himself unto us.…He is prayed to in the form of God, in the form of a
servant He prayeth; there the Creator, here created; assuming unchanged the creature, that
it might be changed, and making us with Himself one Man, Head and Body. Therefore we
pray to Him, through Him, in Him; and we speak with Him, and He speaks with us; we
speak in Him, He speaks in us the prayer of this Psalm, which is entitled, “A Prayer of
David.” For our Lord was, according to the flesh, the son of David; but according to His
divine nature, the Lord of David, and his Maker.…Let no one then, when he hears these
words, say, Christ speaketh not; nor again say, I speak not; nay rather, if he own himself to
be in the Body of Christ, let him say both, Christ speaks, and I speak. Be thou unwilling to
say anything without Him, and He saith nothing without thee.…
2. “Bow down Thine ear, O Lord, and hear me” (ver. 1). He speaks in the form of a ser-
vant: speak thou, O servant, in the form of thy Lord: “Bow down Thine ear, O Lord.” He
bows down His ear, if thou dost not lift up thy neck: for unto the humble He draweth near:
from him that is exalted He removes afar off, except whom He Himself hath exalted from
being humble. God then bows down His ear unto us. For He is above, we below: He in a
high place, we in a lowly one, yet not deserted. “For while we were yet sinners, Christ died
for us. For scarcely for a just man will one die: yet for a good man peradventure one would
even dare to die:”3941 but our Lord died for the wicked. For no merits of ours had gone before,
for which the Son of God should die: but the more, because there were no merits, was His
mercy great. How sure then, how firm is the promise, by which for the righteous He keepeth
His life, who for the wicked gave His own death! “For I am poor and in misery.” To the rich
then He boweth not down His ear: unto the poor and him that is in misery He boweth down
His ear, that is, unto the humble, and him that confesseth, unto him that is in need of mercy:

not unto him that is full, who lifteth up himself and boasteth, as if he wanted nothing, and
saith, “I thank Thee that I am not as this Publican.” For the rich Pharisee boasted of his
merits: the poor Publican confessed his sins.3942
3. Yet do not take what I have said, my brethren, in such a way, as if God does not hear
those who have gold and silver, and a household, and farms, if they happen to be born to
this estate, or hold such a rank in the world: only let them remember the Apostle’s words:
“Charge those who are rich in this world, that they be not highminded.”3943 For those that
are not highminded are poor in God, and to the poor and needy and those in want He inclines
His ear. For they know that their hope is not in gold and silver, nor in those things in which
for a time they seem to abound. It is enough that riches ruin them not; it is enough that they
do them no harm: for good they can do them none. What certainly profiteth is a work of
mercy, done by a rich or by a poor man: by a rich man, with will and deed; by a poor man,
with will alone. When therefore he is such an one as despiseth in himself everything which
is wont to swell men with pride, he is one of God’s poor: He inclines unto him His ear, for
He knows that his heart is contrite.…Was it really for the merit of his poverty that the poor
man was carried away by Angels,3944 or was it for the sin of his riches that the rich man was
sent away to be tormented? In that poor man is signified the honour which is paid to humility,
in that rich man the condemnation which awaits pride. I will prove shortly that it was not
riches but pride which was tormented in that rich man. It is certain that the poor man was
carried into the bosom of Abraham: of Abraham himself Scripture saith that he had here
very much gold and silver, and was rich on the earth. 3945 If every one that is rich is hurried
away to be tormented, how could Abraham have gone before that poor man, so as to be
ready to receive him when carried to his bosom? But Abraham in his riches was poor,
humble, reverencing all commands, and obeying them. So true was it that he counted all
those riches for nothing, that on God’s command he was ready to sacrifice his son,3946 for
whom he was keeping his riches. Learn therefore ye to be poor and needy, whether ye have
anything in this world, or whether ye have not.…
4. “Preserve Thou My Soul, for I am holy” (ver. 2). I know not whether any one could
say this, “I am holy,” but He who was in the world without sin: He by whom all sins were

Psalm LXXXVI
not committed but remitted.3947 We own it to be His voice saying, “Preserve Thou My Soul,
for I am holy;” of course in that form of a servant which He had assumed. For in that was
flesh, in that, was also a Soul. For He was not, as some3948 have said, only Flesh and the
Word: but Flesh and Soul also, and the Word, and all this, One Son of God, One Christ,
One Saviour; in the form of God equal to the Father, in the form of a servant the Head of
the Church. When therefore I hear, “for I am holy,” I recognise His voice: yet do I exclude
my own? Surely He speaks inseparably from His body when He speaks thus. Shall I then
dare to say, “For I am holy”? If holy as making holy, and as needing none to sanctify, I should
be proud and false: but if holy as made holy, as it is written, “Be ye holy, for I am holy,”3949
then the body of Christ may venture, and that one Man “crying from the end of the earth,”3950
may venture with his Head, and under his Head, to say, “For I am holy.” For he hath received
the grace of holiness, the grace of Baptism, and of remission of sins.3951…Say unto thy God,
I am holy, for Thou hast sanctified me: because I received, not because I had: because Thou
gavest, not because I deserved. For on another side thou art beginning to do an injury to
our Lord Jesus Christ Himself. For if all Christians who are faithful and have been baptized
in Him have put Him on, as the Apostle saith, “As many as are baptized in Christ have put
on Christ:”3952 if they have been made members of His body, and say that they are not holy,
they do injury to their Head, of whom they are members, and yet not holy. Look thou where
thou art and from thy Head assume dignity. For thou wert in darkness, “but now light in
the Lord.”3953 “Ye were sometime darkness,” he saith: but did ye remain darkness? Was it
for this the Enlightener came, that ye might still remain darkness, or that in Him ye might
become light? Therefore, every Christian by himself, therefore also the whole body of Christ,
may say, it may cry everywhere, while it suffers tribulations, various temptations and offences,
it may say, “Preserve Thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save Thy servant, that putteth
his trust in Thee.” See thou, that holy man is not proud, since he putteth his trust in God.
5. “Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I have cried unto Thee all day” (ver. 3). Not “one
day:” understand “all day” to mean continually: from the time that the body of Christ groans
being in afflictions, until the end of the world, when afflictions pass away, that man groaneth
and calleth upon God: and each one of us after his measure hath his part in that cry in the
whole body. Thou hast cried in thy days, and thy days have passed away: another hath come

after thee, and cried in his days: and thou here, he there, another elsewhere: the body of
Christ crieth all the day, its members departing and succeeding one another. One Man it is
that reaches to the end of the world: the same members of Christ cry, and some members
already rest in Him, some still cry, some when we shall be at rest will cry, and after them
others will cry. It is the whole body of Christ whose voice He hears, saying, “Unto Thee have
I cried all the day.” Our Head on the right hand of the Father intercedes for us: some
members He recovereth, others He scourgeth, others He cleanseth, others He comforteth,
others He is creating, others calling, others recalling, others correcting, others restoring.
6. “Make glad the soul of Thy servant: for unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul”
(ver. 4). Make it glad, for unto Thee have I lifted it up. For it was on earth, and from the
earth it felt bitterness: lest it should wither away in bitterness, lest it should lose all the
sweetness of Thy grace, I lifted it up unto Thee: make Thou it glad with Thyself. For Thou
alone art gladness: the whole world is full of bitterness. Surely with reason He admonishes
His members to lift up their hearts. May they hear and do it: may they lift up unto Him what
on earth is ill. There the heart decayeth not, if it be lifted up to God. If thou hadst corn in
thy rooms below, thou wouldest take it up higher, lest it should grow rotten. Wouldest thou
remove thy corn, and dost thou suffer thy heart to rot on the earth? Thou wouldest take thy
corn up higher: lift up thy heart to heaven. And how can I, dost thou say? What ropes are
needed? what machines? what ladders? Thy affections are the steps: thy will the way. By
loving thou mountest, by neglect thou descendest. Standing on the earth thou art in heaven,
if thou lovest God. For the heart is not so raised as the body is raised: the body to be lifted
up changes its place: the heart to be lifted up changes its will.
7. “For Thou, Lord, art good and gracious” (ver. 5).…Even prayers are often hindered
by vain thoughts, so that the heart scarcely remains fixed on God: and it would hold itself
so as to be fixed, and somehow flees from itself, and finds no frames in which it can enclose
itself, no bars by which it may keep in its flights and wandering movements, and stand still
to be made glad by its God. Scarcely does one such prayer occur amongst many. Each one
might say that this happened to him, but that it happened not to others, if we did not find
in the holy Scripture David praying in a certain place, and saying, “Since I have found my
heart, O Lord, so that I might pray unto Thee.”3954 He said that he had found his heart, as
if it were wont to flee from him, and he to follow it like a fugitive, and not be able to catch
it, and to cry to God, “For my heart hath deserted me.”3955 Therefore, my brethren, thinking
over what he saith here, I think I see what he meaneth by “gracious.” I seem to feel that for
this reason he calls God gracious, because He bears with those failings of ours, and yet expects
prayer from us, in order to make us perfect: and when we have given it to Him, He receives
3954 2 Sam. vii. 27.
3955 Ps. xxxviii. 10.
Psalm LXXXVI
it gratefully, and listens to it, and remembers not those many prayers which we pour out
unthinkingly, and accepts the one which we can scarcely find. For what man is there, my
brethren, who, on being addressed by his friend, when he wishes to answer his address, sees
his friend turn away from him and speak to another, who is there who would bear this? Or
if you appeal to a judge, and set him up to hear you, and all at once, while you are speaking
to him, pass from him, and begin to converse with your friend, who would endure this? Yet
God endures the hearts of so many persons who pray and think of different things.…What
then? Must we despair of mankind, and say that every man is already condemned into whose
prayers any wandering thoughts have crept and interrupted them? If we say this, my brethren,
I know not what hope remains. Therefore because there is some hope before God, because
His mercy is great, let us say unto Him, “For unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.”
And how have I lifted it up? As I could, as Thou gavest me strength, as I could catch it when
it fled away.…From infirmity I sink: heal Thou me, and I shall stand: strengthen Thou me,
and I shall be strong. But until Thou do this, Thou bearest with me: “For Thou, Lord, art
good and gracious, and of great mercy.” That is, not only “of mercy,” but “of great mercy:”
for as our iniquity abounds, so also aboundeth Thy mercy. “Unto all that call upon Thee.”
What is it then which Scripture saith in many places: “They shall call, and I will not hear
them”?3956 Yet surely Thou art merciful to all that call upon Thee; but that some call, yet
call not upon Him, of whom it is said, “They have not called upon God.”3957 They call, but
not on God. Thou callest upon whatever thou lovest: thou callest upon whatever thou callest
unto thyself, whatever thou wishest to come unto thee. Therefore if thou callest upon God
for this reason, in order that money may come unto thee, that an inheritance may come
unto thee, that worldly rank may come unto thee, thou callest upon those things which thou
desirest may come unto thee: but thou makest God the helper of thy desires, not the listener
to thy needs. God is good, if He gives what thou wishest. What if thou wishest ill, will He
not then be more merciful by not giving? Then, if He gives not, then is God nothing to thee;
and thou sayest, How much I have prayed, how often I have prayed, and have not been
heard! Why, what didst thou ask? Perhaps that thy enemy might die. What if he at the same
time were praying for thy death? He who created thee, created him also: thou art a man, he
too is a man; but God is the Judge: He hears both, and He grants their prayer to neither.
Thou art sad, because thou wast not heard when praying against him; be glad, because his
prayer was not heard against thee. But thou sayest, I did not ask for this; I asked not for the
death of my enemy, but for the life of my child; what ill did I ask? Thou askedst no ill, as
thou didst think. What if “he was taken away, lest wickedness should alter his understand-
ing.”3958 But he was a sinner, thou sayest, and therefore I wished him to live, that he might
3956 Prov. i. 28.
3957 Ps. liii. 4.
3958 Wisd. iv. 11.
Psalm LXXXVI
be corrected. Thou wishedst him to live, that he might become better; what if God knew,
that if he lived he would become worse?…If, therefore, thou callest on God as God, be
confident thou shalt be heard: thou hast part in that verse: “And of great mercy unto all that
call upon Thee.”…
8. Think, brethren, and reflect what good things God giveth unto sinners: and learn
hence what He keepeth for His own servants. To sinners who blaspheme Him every day He
giveth the sky and the earth, He giveth springs, fruits, health, children, wealth, abundance:
all these good things none giveth but God. He who giveth such things to sinners, what
thinkest thou He keeps for His faithful ones? Is this to be believed of Him, that He who
giveth such things to the bad, keepeth nothing for the good? Nay verily He doth keep, not
earth, but heaven for them. Too common a thing perhaps I say when I say heaven; Himself
rather, who made the heaven. Fair is heaven, but fairer is the Maker of heaven. But I see the
heavens, Him I see not. Because thou hast eyes to see the heavens: a heart thou hast not yet
to see the Maker of heaven: therefore came He from heaven to earth, to cleanse the heart,
that He may be seen who made heaven and earth. But wait thou with full patience for salva-
tion. By what treatment to cure thee, He knoweth: by what cutting, what burning, He
knoweth. Thou hast brought sickness on thyself by sinning: He comes not only to nurse,
but also to cut and to burn. Seest thou not how much men suffer under the hands of physi-
cians, when a man promises them an uncertain hope? Thou wilt be cured, says the physician:
thou wilt be cured, if I cut. It is a man who speaks, and to a man that he speaks: neither is
he sure who speaks, nor he who hears, for he who is speaking to the man hath not made
man, and knows not perfectly what is passing in man: yet at the words of a man who knows
not what is passing in man, man sooner believeth, submits his limbs, suffers himself to be
bound, often without being bound is cut or burned; and receives perhaps health for a few
days, even when just healed not knowing when he may die: perhaps, while being healed,
dies; perhaps cannot be healed. But to whom hath God promised anything, and deceived
him?
9. “Fix my prayer in Thy ears, O Lord” (ver. 6). Great earnestness of him who prays!
That is, let not my prayer go out of Thine ears, fix it then in Thine ears. How did he travail
that he might fix his prayer in the ears of God? Let God answer and say to us; Wouldest
thou that I fix thy prayer in My ears? Fix My law in thy heart; “and attend to the voice of
my prayer.”
10. “In the day of my trouble I have cried unto Thee, for Thou hast heard me” (ver. 7).
A little before he had said, All the day have I cried, all the day have I been troubled. Let no
Christian then say that there is any day in which he is not troubled. By “all the day” we have
understood the whole of time. What then, is there trouble even when it is well with us? Even
so, trouble. How is there trouble? Because “as long as we are in the body we are absent from
Psalm LXXXVI
the Lord.”3959 Let what will abound here, we are not yet in that country whither we are
hastening to return. He to whom foreign travel is sweet, loveth not his country: if his
country is sweet, travel is bitter; if travel is bitter, all the day there is trouble. When is there
not trouble? When there is joy in one’s country. “At Thy right hand are delights for ever-
more.”3960 “Thou shalt fill me with joy,” he saith, “with Thy countenance: that I may see
the delight of the Lord.”3961 There toil and groaning shall pass away: there shall be not
prayer but praise; there Alleluia, there Amen, the voice in concord with Angels; there vision
without failing and love without weariness. So long therefore as we are not there, ye see that
we are not in that which is good. But do all things abound? If all things abound, see if thou
art assured that all things perish not. But I have what I had not: more money is come to me
which I had not before. Perhaps more fear too is come, which thou hadst not before: perhaps
thou wast so much the more secure as thou wast the poorer. In fine, be it that thou hast
wealth, that thou hast redundance of this world’s affluence, that thou hast assurance given
thee that all this shall not perish; besides this, that God say unto thee, Thou shalt remain
for ever in these things, they shall be for ever with thee, but My face thou shalt not see. Let
none ask counsel of the flesh: ask ye counsel of the Spirit: let your heart answer you; let hope,
faith, charity, which has begun to be in you, answer. If then we were to receive assurance
that we should always be in affluence of worldly goods, and if God were to say to us, My
face ye shall not see, would ye rejoice in these goods? Some one might perhaps choose to
rejoice, and say, These things abound unto me, it is well with me, I ask no more. He hath
not yet begun to be a lover of God: he hath not yet begun to sigh like one far from home.
Far be it, far be it from us: let them retire, all those seductions: let them retire, those false
blandishments: let them be gone, those words which they say daily unto us, “Where is thy
God?” Let us pour out our soul3962 over us,3963 let us confess in tears, let us groan in con-
fession, let us sigh in misery. Whatever is present with us besides our God, is not sweet: we
would not have all things that He hath given, if He gives not Himself who gave all things.
11. “Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, O Lord” (ver. 8). What did he say?
“Among the gods,” etc. Let the Pagans make for themselves what gods they will; let them
bring workmen in silver and in gold, furbishers, sculptors; let them make gods. What kind
of gods? Having eyes, and seeing not;3964 and the other things which the Psalm mentions
in what follows. But we do not worship these, he says; we do not worship them, these are

symbols. What then do ye worship? Something else that is worse: for the gods of the gentiles
are devils. What then? Neither, say they, do we worship devils. Ye have certainly nothing
else in your temples, nothing else inspires your prophets than a devil.3965 But what do ye
say? We worship Angels, we have Angels as gods. Ye know not altogether what Angels are.
Angels worship the one God, and favour not men who wish to worship Angels and not God.
For we find Angels of high rank3966 forbidding men to adore them, and commanding them
to adore the true God.3967 But when they say Angels, suppose they mean men, since it is
said, “I have said, Ye are Gods, and all the children of the Most Highest.”3968 Whatever3969
man thinks to the contrary, that which was made is not like Him who made it. Except God,
whatever else there is in the universe was made by God. What a difference there is between
Him who made, and that which was made, who can worthily imagine? Therefore this man
said, “there is none like unto Thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do as thou doest.” But
how much God is unlike them he said not, because it cannot be said. Let your Charity attend:
God is ineffable: we more easily say what He is not than what He is. Thou thinkest of the
earth; this is not God: thou thinkest of the sea; this is not God: of all things which are in the
earth, men and animals; this is not God: of all things which are in the sea, which fly through
the air; this is not God: whatever shines in the sky, the stars, sun and moon; this is not God:
the heaven itself; this is not God: think of the Angels, Virtues, Powers, Archangels, Thrones,
Seats, Principalities; this is not God. What is He then? I could only tell thee, what He is not.
Askest thou what He is? What “the eye hath not seen, nor the ear heard, nor hath risen up
into the heart of man.”3970…
12. “All nations that Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, O Lord”
(ver. 9). He has announced the Church: “All nations.” If there is any nation which God hath
not made, it will not worship Him: but there is no nation which God hath not made; because
God made Adam and Eve, the source of all nations, thence all nations sprang. All nations
therefore hath God made. When was this said? When before Him there worshipped none
but a few holy men in one people of the Hebrews, then this was said: and see now what it
is which was said: “All nations that Thou hast made,” etc. When these things were spoken,
they were not seen, and they were believed: now that they are seen, why are they denied?
“All nations that Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, O Lord, and shall
glorify Thy Name.”

13. “For Thou art great, and doing wondrous things: Thou alone art the great God”
(ver. 10). Let no man call himself great. Some were to be who would call themselves great:
against these it is said, “Thou alone art the great God.” For what great thing is ascribed to
God, when it is said that He alone is the great God? Who knows not that He is the great
God? But because there were to be some who would call themselves great and make God
little, against these it is said, “Thou alone art the great God.” For what Thou sayest is fulfilled,
not what those say who call themselves great. What hath God said by His Spirit? “All nations.”
What saith he, whoever he is, who calleth himself great? “Far from it: God is not worshipped
in all nations: all nations have perished, Africa alone remains.” This thou sayest, who callest
thyself great:3971 another thing He saith who alone is the great God. What saith He, who
alone is the great God? “All nations.” I see what the only great God hath said: let man be
silent, who is falsely great; great only in appearance, because he disdains to be small. Who
disdains to be small? He who saith this. Whoever will be great among you, said the Lord,
shall be your servant.3972 If that man had wished to be the servant of his brethren, he would
not have separated them from their mother: but when he wishes to be great, and wishes not
to be small, as would be for his welfare, God, who resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to
the humble,3973 because He alone is great, fulfilleth all things which He predicted, and
contradicteth those who blaspheme. For such persons blaspheme against Christ, who say
that the Church has perished from the whole world, and is left only in Africa. If thou wert
to say to him, Thou wilt lose thy villa, he would perhaps scarcely keep from laying his hand
upon thee: and yet he says, that Christ has lost His inheritance, redeemed by His own Blood!
See now what a wrong he does, my brethren. The Scripture says, “In a wide nation is the
king’s honour; but in the domination of the people is the affliction3974 of a prince.”3975 This
wrong then thou dost unto Christ, to say that His people is diminished to that small number.
Was it for this thou wast born, for this thou callest thyself a Christian, that thou mayest
grudge Christ His glory, whose sign thou sayest that thou bearest on thy forehead, and hast
lost out of thy heart? In a wide nation is the king’s honour: acknowledge thy King: give Him
glory, give Him a wide nation. What wide nation shall I give Him, dost thou say? Choose
not to give Him from thy own heart, and thou wilt give aright. Whence am I to give? thou
wilt say. Lo, give from hence: “All nations that Thou hast made shall come and worship
before Thee, O Lord.” Say this, confess this, and thou hast given a wide nation: for all nations
in One are one: this is very oneness. For as there is a Church and Churches, and those are

Churches which also are a Church, so that is a nation which was nations: formerly nations,
many nations, now one nation. Why one nation? Because one faith, one hope, one charity,
one expectation. Lastly, why not one nation, if one country? Our country is heavenly, our
country is Jerusalem: whoever is not a citizen of it, belongs not to that nation: but whoever
is a citizen of it is in that one nation of God. And this nation, from the east to the west, from
the north and the sea, is extended through the four quarters of the whole world. This God
saith: From the east and west, from the north and the sea, give glory to God. This He foretold,
this He fulfilled, who alone is great. Let him therefore who would not be little cease from
saying this against Him who alone is great: for there cannot be two great, God and
Donatus.3976
14. “Lead me, O Lord, in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth” (ver. 11). Thy way, Thy
truth, Thy life, is Christ. Therefore belongeth the Body to Him, and the Body is of Him. I
am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.3977 “Lead me, O Lord, in Thy way.” In what way?
“And I will walk in Thy truth.” It is one thing to lead to the way, another to guide in the
way. Behold man everywhere poor, everywhere in need of help. Those who are beside the
way are not Christians, or not yet Catholics: let them be guided to the way: but when they
have been brought to the way and made Catholics in Christ, they must be guided by Him
in the way itself, lest they fall. 3978 Now assuredly they walk in the way. “Lead me, O Lord,
in Thy way:” surely I am now in Thy way, lead me there. “And I will walk in Thy truth:”
while Thou leadest I shall not err: if Thou let me go, I shall err. Pray then that He let thee
not go, but lead thee even to the end. How doth He lead thee? By always admonishing, always
giving thee His hand. And the arm of the Lord, to whom is it revealed?3979 For in giving
His Christ He giveth His hand: in giving His hand, He giveth His Christ. He leadeth to the
way, in leading to His Christ: He leadeth in the way, by leading in His Christ, and Christ is
truth. “Lead me,” therefore, “O Lord, in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth:” in Him
verily who said, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.”3980 For Thou who leadest in
the way and the truth, whither leadest Thou, but unto life? In Him then, unto Him Thou
leadest.
15. “Let my heart be made glad, so that it may fear Thy name.” There is then fear in
gladness. How can there be gladness, if fear? Is not fear wont to be painful? There will
hereafter be gladness without fear, now gladness with fear; for not yet is there perfect security,

nor perfect gladness. If there is no gladness, we faint: if full security, we rejoice wrongly.
Therefore may He both sprinkle on us gladness, and strike fear into us, that by the sweetness
of gladness He may lead us to the abode of security; by giving us fear, may cause us not to
rejoice wrongly, and to withdraw from the way. Therefore saith the Psalm: “Serve the Lord
in fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling:”3981 so also saith the Apostle Paul; “Work
out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you.”3982
Whatever prosperity comes then, my brethren, is rather to be feared: those things which ye
think to be prosperous, are rather temptations. An inheritance cometh, there cometh wealth,
there is an abundant overflow of some happiness: these are temptations: take care that they
corrupt you not. Whatever prosperity also there is according to Christ, and the true love of
Christ: if perhaps thou hast gained thy wife, who was of the party of Donatus: if thy sons
have been made believers who were Pagans: if perhaps thou hast gained thy friend who
wished to draw thee away to the theatres, and thou hast drawn him to the church: if some
hostile opponent of thine who was furiously mad against thee, laying aside his fury, has be-
come gentle, and owned God, and now barks at thee no more, but cries with thee against
wickedness: these things are pleasant. For what do we rejoice for, if we do not rejoice for
these things? Or what other are our joys, but these? But because tribulations also abound,
and temptations, and dissensions, and schisms, and other evils,3983 without which this world
cannot be, until iniquity pass away: let not that rejoicing make us secure, but let our heart
be so made glad, as to fear the name of the Lord, lest it be made glad on one side, be stricken
on another. Expect not security in journeying: if ever we wish for it here, it will be the birdlime
of the body,3984 not the safety of the man. “Let my heart be made glad, so that it may fear
Thy name.”
16. “I will confess unto Thee, O Lord my God, in my whole heart, and I will glorify Thy
name for ever” (ver. 12): “for great is Thy mercy toward me, and Thou hast delivered my
soul from the nethermost hell” (ver. 13). Do not be angry, brethren, if I do not explain what
I have said as though I were certain. For I am a man, and as much as is granted to me con-
cerning the sacred Scriptures, so much I venture to speak: nothing of myself. Hades3985 I
have not yet seen, nor have you: and there will be perhaps another way for us, and not
through Hades. These things are uncertain. But because Scripture, which cannot be gainsaid,
says, “Thou hast delivered my soul from the nether-most hell,” we understand that there

no dogma on this point, but speaks of his views as uncertain.—C.]
Psalm LXXXVI
are as it were two hells, an upper one and a lower one: for how can there be a lower hell,
unless because there is also an upper? The one would not be called lower, except by compar-
ison with that upper part. It appears then, my brethren, that there is some heavenly abode
of Angels: there is there a life of ineffable joys, there immortality and incorruption, there
all things abiding according to the gift and grace of God. That part of the creation is above.
If then that is above, but this earthly part, where is flesh and blood, where is corruptibleness,
where is nativity and mortality, departure and succession, changeableness and inconstancy,
where are fears, desires, horrors, uncertain joys, frail hope, perishable existence; I suppose
that all this part cannot be compared with that heaven of which I was just now speaking; if
then this part cannot be compared with that, the one is above, the other below. And whither
do we go after death, unless there is a depth deeper than this depth3986 in which we are in
the flesh and in this mortal state? For “the body is dead,” saith the Apostle, “because of
sin.”3987 Therefore even here are the dead; that thou mayest not wonder because it is called
infernum, if it abounds with the dead. For he saith not, the body is about to die: but, “the
body is dead.” Even now surely our body hath life: and yet compared with that body which
is to be like the bodies of Angels, the body of man is found to be dead, although still having
life. But again, from this infernum, that is from this part of Hades, there is another lower,
whither the dead go: from whence God would rescue our souls, even sending thither His
own Son. For it was on account of these two hells, my brethren, that the Son of God was
sent, on all sides setting free. To this hell he was sent by being born, to that by dying.
Therefore it is His voice in that Psalm, not according to any man’s conjecture, but an Apostle
explaining, when he saith, “For Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.”3988 Therefore it is here
also either His voice, “Thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hell:” or our voice
by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself: for on this account He came even unto hell, that we might
not remain in hell.
17. I will mention another opinion also. For perhaps even in hell itself there is some
lower part where are thrust the ungodly who have sinned most.3989 For whether in hell
there were not some places where Abraham was, we cannot define sufficiently. For not yet
had the Lord come to hell that He might rescue from thence the souls of all the saints who
had gone before,3990 and yet Abraham was there in repose.3991 And a certain rich man
when he was in torments in hell, when he saw Abraham, lifted up his eyes. He could not

have seen him by lifting up his eyes, unless the one was above, the other below. And what
did Abraham answer unto him, when he said, “send Lazarus.” “My son,” he said, “remember
that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but
now he is at rest, but thou art tormented. And besides this,” he said, “between us and you
there is a great gulf fixed, so that neither can we go to you, nor can any one come from
thence to us.”3992 Therefore between these two hells, perhaps, in one of which the souls of
the just have gotten rest, in the other the souls of the ungodly are tormented, one waiting
and praying here, placed here in the body of Christ, and praying in the voice of Christ, said
that God had delivered his soul from the nethermost hell, because He delivered him from
such sins as might have been the means of drawing him down to the torments of the neth-
ermost hell.…Some one having a troublesome cause was to be sent to prison: another comes
and defends him; what does he say when he thanks him? Thou hast delivered my soul out
of prison. A debtor was to be hanged up:3993 his debt is paid; he is said to be delivered from
being hanged up. They were not in all these evils: but because they were in such due course
towards them,3994 that unless aid had been brought, they would have been in them, they
rightly say that they are delivered from thence, whither they were not suffered by their de-
liverers to be taken. Therefore, brethren, whether it be this or that, consider me to be herein
an inquirer into the word of God, not a rash assertor.3995
18. “O God, the transgressors of the law have arisen up against me” (ver. 14). Whom
calleth he transgressors of the law? Not the Pagans, who have not received the law: for no
one transgresseth that which he hath not received; the Apostle saith clearly, “For where
there is no law, there is no prevarication.”3996 Transgressors of the law he calls “prevaricat-
ors.” Whom then do we understand, brethren? If we take this word from our Lord Himself,
the transgressors of the law were the Jews.…They did not keep the law, and accused Christ
as if He transgressed the law. And we know what the Lord suffered. Thinkest thou His Body
suffers no such thing now? How can this be? “If they called the Master of the house Beelzebub,
how much more those of his household? The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant
above his lord.”3997 The body also suffereth transgressors of the law, and they rise up against
the Body of Christ. Who are the transgressors of the law? Do the Jews perchance dare to

rise up against Christ? No: for it is not they that cause us much trouble. For they have not
yet believed: they have not yet owned their salvation. Against the Body of Christ bad
Christians rise up, from whom the Body of Christ daily suffereth trouble. All schisms, all
heresies, all within who live wickedly and engraft their own character on those who live
well, and draw them over to their own side, and with evil communications corrupt good
manners; these persons “transgressing the law rose up against Me.”3998 Let every pious soul
speak, let every Christian soul speak. That one which suffers not this, let it not speak. But
if it is a Christian soul, it knows that it suffers evils: if it owns in itself its own sufferings, let
it own herein its own voice; but if it is without suffering, let it3999 also be without the voice;
but that it may not be without suffering, let it walk along the narrow way,4000 and begin to
live godly in Christ: it must of necessity suffer this persecution. For “all,” saith the Apostle,
“who will live godly in Christ, suffer persecution.”4001
“And the synagogue of the powerful have sought after My soul.” The synagogue of the
powerful is the congregation of the proud. The synagogue of the powerful rose up against
the Head, that is, our Lord Jesus Christ, crying and saying with one mouth, Crucify Him,
crucify Him:4002 of whom it is said, “The sons of men, their teeth are spears and arrows,
and their tongue a sharp sword.”4003 They did not strike, but cried: by crying they struck,
by crying they crucified Him. The will of those who cried was fulfilled, when the Lord was
crucified: “And they did not place Thee before their eyes.” How did they not place Him before
them? They did not know Him God. They should have spared him as Man: what they saw,
according to this they should have walked. Suppose that He was not God, He was man: was
He therefore to be slain? Spare Him a man, and own Him God.
19. “And Thou, Lord God, art One who hast compassion and merciful, longsuffering,
and very pitiful, and true” (ver. 15). Wherefore longsuffering and very pitiful, and One who
hast compassion? Because hanging on the Cross He said: “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do.”4004 Whom prayeth He to? for whom doth He pray? Who prayeth?
Where prayeth He? The Son prays to the Father, crucified for the ungodly, in the midst of
very insults, not of words but of death inflicted, hanging on the Cross; as if for this He had
His hands stretched out, that thus He might pray for them, that His “prayer might be directed

20. If therefore Thou art “true,” “Look upon me, and have mercy upon me: give power
unto Thy servant.” Because Thou art “true,” “give power unto Thy servant” (ver. 16). Let
the time of patience pass away, the time of judgment come. How, “give power”? The Father
judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.4006 He rising again will
come even to earth Himself to judge: He will appear terrible who appeared despicable. He
will show His power, who showed His patience; on the Cross was patience; in the judgment
will be power. For He will appear as Man judging, but in glory: because “as ye saw Him go,”
said the Angels, “so He will come.”4007 His very form shall come to judgment; therefore the
ungodly also shall see Him: for they shall not see the form of God. For blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God.4008…In the vision of the Father there is also the vision of
the Son: and in the vision of the Son there is also the vision of the Father. Therefore He adds
a consequence, and says: “Know ye not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?”4009
that is, both in Me seen the Father is seen, and in the Father seen the Son too is seen. The
vision of the Father and the Son cannot be separated: where nature and substance is not
separated, there vision cannot be separated. For that ye may know that the heart ought to
be made ready for that place, to see the Divinity of the Father and Son and Holy Spirit, in
which though not seen we believe, and by believing cleanse the heart that there may be able
to be sight: the Lord Himself saith in another place, “He that hath My commands and kee-
peth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved by My Father: and
I will love him, and will manifest Myself unto him.”4010 Did they not see Him, with whom
He was talking? They both saw Him, and did not see Him? they saw something, they believed
something: they saw Man, they believed in God. But in the Judgment they shall see the same
Lord Jesus Christ as Man, together with the wicked: after the Judgment, they shall see God,
apart from the wicked.
21. “And save the Son of Thine handmaid.” The Lord is the Son of the handmaid. Of
what handmaid? Her who when He was announced as about to be born of her, answered
and said, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to Thy word.”4011 He
saved the Son of His handmaid, and His own Son: His own Son, in the Form of God;4012

the Son of His handmaid in the form of a servant. Of the handmaid of God, therefore, the
Lord was born in the form of a servant; and He said, “Save the Son of Thine handmaid.”
And He was saved from death, as ye know, His flesh, which was dead, being raised
again.…And each several Christian placed in the Body of Christ may say, “Save the Son of
Thine handmaid.” Perhaps he cannot say, “Give power unto Thy servant:” because it was
He, the Son, who received power. Yet wherefore saith He not this also? Was it not said to
servants, “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel”?4013 and the
servants say, “Know ye not that we shall judge Angels?”4014 Each one therefore of the saints
receiveth also power, and each several saint is the son of His handmaid. What if he is born
of a pagan mother, and has become a Christian? How can the son of a pagan be the son of
His handmaid: He is indeed the son of a pagan mother after the flesh, but the son of the
Church after the Spirit.
22. “Show me a sign for good” (ver. 17). What sign, but that of the Resurrection? The
Lord says: “This wicked and provoking generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no
sign be given it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonah.”4015 Therefore in our Head a sign has
been shown already for good; each one of us also may say, “Show me a sign for good:” because
at the last trumpet, at the coming of the Lord, both “the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed.”4016 This will be a sign for good. “That they who hate me may see
it, and be ashamed.” In the judgment they shall be ashamed unto their destruction, who will
not now be ashamed unto their healing. Now therefore let them be ashamed: let them accuse
their own ways, let them keep the good way: because none of us liveth without being ashamed,
unless he first be ashamed and live anew. Now God grants them the approach of a healthy
shame, if they despise not the medicine of confession: but if they will not now be ashamed,
then they shall be ashamed, when “their iniquities shall convince them to their face.”4017
How shall they be ashamed? When they shall say, “These are they whom we had sometimes
in derision, and a parable of reproach. We fools counted their life madness: how are they
numbered among the children of God! What hath pride profited us?”4018 Then shall they
say this: let them say it now, and they say it to their health. For let each one turn humbly to
God, and now say, What hath my pride profited me? and hear from the Apostle, “For what
glory had ye in those things of which ye are now ashamed?”4019 Ye see that there is even

23. “For Thou, Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me.” “Hast holpen me,” in struggle;
“and comforted me,” in sorrow. For no one seeketh comfort, but he who is in misery. Would
ye not be consoled? Say that ye are happy, and ye hear, “My people” (now ye answer, and I
hear a murmur, as of persons who remember the Scriptures.4020 May God, who hath written
this in your hearts, confirm it in your deeds. Ye see, brethren, that those who say unto you,
Ye are happy, seduce you), “O My people, they that call you happy cause you to err, and
disturb the way of your feet.”4021 So also from the Epistle of the Apostle James: “Be afflicted,
and mourn: let your laughter be turned to mourning.”4022 Ye see what ye have heard read:
when would such things be said unto us in the land of security? This surely is the land of
offences, and temptations, and of all evils, that we may groan here, and deserve to rejoice
there; here to be troubled, and there to be comforted, and to say, “For Thou hast delivered
mine eyes from tears, my feet from falling: I will please the Lord in the land of the living.”4023
This is the land of the dead. The land of the dead passeth, the land of the living cometh. In
the land of the dead is labour, grief, fear, tribulation, temptation, groaning, sighing: here
are false happy ones, true unhappy, because happiness is false, misery is true. But he that
owneth himself to be in true misery, will also be in true happiness: and yet now because
thou art miserable, hear the Lord saying, “Blessed are they that mourn.” 4024 O blessed they
that mourn! Nothing is so akin to misery as mourning: nothing so remote and contrary to
misery as blessedness: Thou speakest of those who mourn, and Thou callest them blessed!
Understand, He saith, what I say: I call those who mourn blessed. Wherefore blessed? In
hope. Wherefore mourning? In act. For they mourn in this death, in these tribulations, in
their wandering: and because they own themselves to be in this misery, and mourn, they
are blessed. Wherefore do they mourn? The blessed Cyprian was put to sorrow in his passion:
now he is comforted with his crown; now though comforted, he was sad. For our Lord Jesus
Christ still intercedeth for us: all the Martyrs who are with Him intercede for us. Their in-
tercessions pass not away, except when our mourning is passed away: but when our
mourning shall have passed away, we all with one voice, in one people, in one country, shall
receive comfort, thousands of thousands joined with Angels playing upon harps, with choirs
of heavenly powers living in one city. Who mourneth there? Who there sigheth? Who there
toileth? Who there needeth? Who dieth there? Who there showeth mercy? Who breaketh

bread to the hungry there, where all are satisfied with the bread of righteousness? No one
saith unto thee, Receive a stranger; there no one will be a stranger to thee: all live in their
own country. No one saith unto thee, Set at one thy friends disputing; in everlasting peace
they enjoy the Face of God. No one saith unto thee, Visit the sick; health and immortality
abide for ever. No one saith unto thee, Bury the dead; all shall be in everlasting life. Works
of mercy stop, because misery is found not. And what shall we do there? Shall we perhaps
sleep? If now we fight against ourselves, although we carry about a house of sleep, this flesh
of ours, and keep watch with these lights, and this solemn feast gives us a mind to watch;
what wakefulness shall that day give unto us! Therefore we shall be awake, we shall not sleep.
What shall we do?4025 There will be no works of mercy, because there will be no misery.
Perhaps there will be these necessary works which there are here now, of sowing, ploughing,
cooking, grinding, weaving? None of these, for there will be no want. Thus there will be no
works of mercy, because misery is past away: where there is no want nor misery, there will
be neither works of necessity nor of mercy. What will be there? What business shall we
have? What action? Will there be no action, because there is rest? Shall we sit there, and be
torpid, and do nothing? If our love grow cold, our action will grow cold. How then will that
love resting in the face of God, for whom we now long, for whom we sigh, how will it inflame
us, when we shall have come to Him? He for whom while as yet we see Him not, we so sigh,
how will He enlighten us, when we shall have come to Him? How will He change us? What
will He make of us? What then shall we do, brethren? Let the Psalm tell us: “Blessed are they
who dwell in Thy house.” Why? “They shall praise Thee for ever and ever.”4026 This will be
our employment, praise of God. Thou lovest and praisest. Thou wilt cease to praise, if thou
cease to love. But thou wilt not cease to love, because He whom thou seest is such an One
as offends thee not by any weariness: He both satisfies thee, and satisfies thee not. What I
say is wonderful. If I say that He satisfies thee, I am afraid lest as though satisfied thou
shouldest wish to depart, as from a dinner or from a supper. What then do I say? doth He
not satisfy thee? I am afraid again, that if I say, He doth not satisfy thee, thou shouldest seem
to be in want: and shouldest be as it were empty, and there should be in thee some void
which ought to be filled. What then shall I say, except what can be said, but can hardly be
thought? He both satisfies thee, and satisfies thee not: for I find both in Scripture. For while
He said, “Blessed are the hungry, for they shall be filled;”4027 it is again said of Wisdom,
“Those who eat Thee shall hunger again, and those who drink shall thirst again.”4028 Nay,
but He did not say “again,” but he said, “still:” for “shall thirst again” is as if once having

been filled he departed and digested, and returned to drink. So it is, “Those who eat Thee
shall still hunger:” thus when they eat they hunger: and those who drink Thee, even thus
when drinking, thirst. What is it, to thirst in drinking? Never to grow weary. If then there
shall be that ineffable and eternal sweetness, what doth He now seek of us, brethren, but
faith unfeigned, firm hope, pure charity? and man may walk in the way which the Lord hath
given, may bear troubles, and receive consolations.
Psalm LXXXVI
Psalm LXXXVII.4029
1. The Psalm which has just been sung is short, if we look to the number of its words,
but of deep interest in its thoughts.4030…The subject of song and praise in that Psalm is a
city, whose citizens are we, as far as we are Christians: whence we are absent, as long as we
are mortal: whither we are tending: through whose approaches, undiscoverable among the
brakes and thorns that entangle them, the Sovereign of the city made Himself a path4031
for us to reach it. Walking thus in Christ, and pilgrims till we arrive, and sighing as we long
for a certain ineffable repose that dwells within that city, a repose of which it is promised,
that “the eye of man hath never seen” such, “nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into his heart
to conceive;” let us chant the song of a longing heart: for he who truly longs, thus sings
within his soul, though his tongue be silent: he who does not, however he may resound in
human ears, is voiceless to God. See what ardent lovers of that city were they by whom these
words were composed, by whom they have been handed down to us; with how deep a feeling
were they sung by those! A feeling that the love of that city created in them: that love the
Spirit of God inspired; “the love of God,” he saith, “shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost, which is given unto us.” Fervent with this Spirit then, let us listen to what is said of
that city.
2. “Her foundations are upon the holy hills” (ver. 1). The Psalm had as yet said nothing
of the city: it begins thus, and says, “Her foundations are upon the holy hills.” Whose? There
can be no doubt that foundations, especially among the hills, belong to some city. Thus
filled with the Holy Spirit, and with many thoughts of love and longing for that city, as if
after long internal meditation, that citizen bursts out, “Her foundations are upon the holy
hills;” as if he had already said something concerning it. And how could he have said nothing
on a subject, respecting which in his heart he had never been silent? For how could “her
foundations” have been written, of which nothing had been said before? But, as I said, after
long and silent travailing in contemplation of that city in his mind, crying to God, he bursts
out into the ears of men thus: “Her foundations are upon the holy hills.” And, supposing
persons who heard to enquire of what city he spoke he adds, “the Lord loveth the gates of
Sion.” Behold, then, a city whose foundations are upon the holy hills, a city called Sion,
whose gates the Lord loveth, as he adds, “above all the dwellings of Jacob.” But what doth
this mean, “her foundations on the holy hills”? What are the holy hills upon which this city
is built? Another citizen tells us this more explicitly, the Apostle Paul: of this was the
Prophet a citizen, of this the Apostle citizen: and they spoke to exhort the other citizens.

4031 Se fecit viam.
Psalm LXXXVII
Psalm LXXXVII
But how are these, I mean the Prophets and Apostles, citizens? Perhaps in this sense; that
they are themselves the hills, upon which are the foundations of this city, whose gates the
Lord loveth. Let then another citizen state this clearly, that I may not seem to guess. Speaking
to the Gentiles, and telling them how they were returning, and being, as it were, framed to-
gether into the holy structure, “built,” he says, “upon the foundations of the Apostles and
Prophets:” and because neither the Apostles nor Prophets, upon whom the foundations of
that city rest, could stand by their own power, he adds, “Jesus Christ Himself being the head
comer stone.”4032 That the Gentiles, therefore, might not think they had no relation to Sion:
for Sion was a certain city of this world, which bore a typical resemblance as a shadow to
that Sion of which he presently speaketh, that Heavenly Jerusalem, of which the Apostle
saith, “which is the mother of us all;”4033 they might not be said to bear no relation to Sion,
on the ground that they did not belong to the Jewish people, he addresses them thus: “Now
therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and
of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets.”4034
Thou seest the structure of so great a city: yet whereon does all that edifice repose, where
does it rest, that it may never fall? “Jesus Christ Himself,” he saith, “being the head corner
stone.”
3. …But that ye may know that Christ is at once the earliest and the highest foundation,
the Apostle saith, “Other foundation can no man lay than is laid, which is Christ Jesus.”4035
How, then, are the Prophets and Apostles foundations, and yet Christ so, than whom
nothing can be higher? How, think you, save that as He is openly styled, Saint of saints, so
figuratively Foundation of foundations? Thus if thou art thinking of mysteries, Christ is the
Saint of saints: if of a subject flock, the Shepherd of shepherds: if of a structure, the Pillar of
pillars. In material edifices, the same stone cannot be above and below: if at the bottom, it
cannot be at the top: and vice versa: for almost all bodies are liable to limitations in space:
nor can they be everywhere or for ever; but as the Godhead is in every place, from every
place symbols may be taken for It; and not being any of these things in external properties,
It can be everything in figure. Is Christ a door, in the same sense as the doors we see made
by carpenters? Surely not; and yet He said, “I am the door.” Or a shepherd, in the same ca-
pacity as those who guard sheep? though He said, “I am the Shepherd.” Both these names
occur in the same passage: in the Gospel, He said, that the shepherd enters by the door: the
words are, “I am the good Shepherd;” and in the same passage, “I am the door:”4036 and
4032 Eph. ii. 20.

4034 Eph. ii. 19, 20.
4035 1 Cor. iii. 11.
4036 John x. 11, 9.
Psalm LXXXVII
who is the shepherd who enters by the door? “I am the good Shepherd:” and what is the
door by which Thou, Good Shepherd, enterest? How then art Thou all things? In the sense
in which everything is through Me. To explain: when Paul enters by the door, does not
Christ? Wherefore? Not because Paul is Christ: but since Christ is in Paul: and Paul acts
through Christ. The Apostle says, “Do ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?” 4037 When
His saints and faithful disciples enter by the door, does not Christ enter by the door? How
are we to prove this? Since Saul, not yet called Paul, was persecuting those very saints, when
He called to him from Heaven, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?”4038 Himself then is
the foundation, and corner stone: rising from the bottom: if indeed from the bottom: for
the base of this foundation is the highest exaltation of the building: and as the support of
bodily fabrics rests upon the ground, that of spiritual structures reposes on high. Were we
building up ourselves upon the earth, we should lay our foundation on the lowest level: but
since our edifice is a heavenly one, to Heaven our Foundation has gone before us: so that
our Saviour, the corner stone, the Apostles, and mighty Prophets, the hills that bear the
fabric of the city, constitute a sort of living structure. This building now cries from your
hearts; that you may be built up into its fabric, the hand of God, as of an artificer, worketh
even through my tongue. Nor was it without a meaning that Noah’s ark was made of “square
beams,”4039 which were typical of the form of the Church. For what is it to be made square?
Listen to the resemblance of the squared stone: like qualities should the Christian have: for
in all his trials he never falls: though pushed, and, as it were, turned over, he falls not: and
thus too, whichever way a square stone is turned, it stands erect.…In earthly cities, one thing
is the structure of buildings: another thing are the citizens that dwell therein: that city is
builded of its own inmates, who are themselves the blocks that form the city, for the very
stones are living: “Ye also,” says the Apostle, “as living stones, are built up a spiritual
house,”4040 words that are addressed to ourselves. Let us then pursue the contemplation of
that city.
4. “The Lord loveth the gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob” (ver. 2). I
have made the foregoing remarks, that ye may not imagine the gates are one thing, the
foundations another. Why are the Apostles and Prophets foundations? Because their authority
is the support of our weakness. Why are they gates? because through them we enter the
kingdom of God: for they proclaim it to us: and while we enter by their means, we enter
also through Christ, Himself being the Gate. And twelve gates of Jerusalem are spoken
of,4041 and the one gate is Christ, and the twelve gates are Christ for Christ dwells in the

Psalm LXXXVII
twelve gates, hence was twelve the number of the Apostles. There is a deep mystery in this
number of twelve: “Ye shall sit,” says our Saviour, “on twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.”4042 If there are twelve thrones there, there will be no room for the judgment-
seat of Paul, the thirteenth Apostle, though he says that he shall judge not men only, but
even Angels; which, but the fallen Angels? “Know ye not, that we shall judge Angels,”4043
he writes. The world would answer, Why dost thou boast that thou shalt be a judge? Where
will be thy throne? Our Lord spoke of twelve thrones for the twelve Apostles: one, Judas,
fell, and his place being supplied by Matthias, the number of twelve thrones was made
up:4044 first, then, discover room for thy judgment-seat; then threaten that thou wilt judge.
Let us, therefore, reflect upon the meaning of the twelve thrones. The expression is typical
of a sort of universality, as the Church was destined to prevail throughout the whole world:
whence this edifice is styled a building together into Christ: and because judges come from
all quarters, the twelve thrones are spoken of, just as the twelve gates, from the entering in
from all sides into that city. Not only therefore have those twelve, and the Apostle Paul, a
claim to the twelve thrones, but, from the universal signification, all who are to sit in judg-
ment: in the same manner as all who enter the city, enter by one or the other of the twelve
gates. There are four quarters of the globe: East, West, North, and South: and they are con-
stantly alluded to in the Scriptures. From all those four winds; our Lord declares in the
Gospel that He will call his sheep “from the four winds;”4045 therefore from all those four
winds is the Church called. And how called? On every side it is called in the Trinity: no
otherwise is it called than by Baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost:
four then being thrice taken, twelve are found. Knock, therefore, with all your hearts at these
gates: and let Christ cry within you: “Open me the gates of righteousness.”4046 For He went
before us the Head: He follows Himself in His Body.…
5. “Very excellent things are said of thee, thou city of God” (ver. 3). He was, as it were,
contemplating that city of Jerusalem on earth: for consider what city he alludes to, of which
certain very excellent things are spoken. Now the earthly city has been destroyed: after suf-
fering the enemy’s rage, it fell to the earth; it is no longer what it was: it exhibited the emblem,
and the shadow hath passed away. Whence then are “very excellent things spoken of thee,
thou city of God”? Listen whence: “I will think upon Rahab and Babylon, with them that
know Me” (ver. 4). In that city, the Prophet, in the person of God, says, “I will think upon
Rahab and Babylon.” Rahab belongs not to the Jewish people;4047 Babylon belongs not to

the Jewish people; as is clear from the next verse: “For the Philistines4048 also, and Tyre,
with the Ethiopians, were there.” Deservedly then, “very excellent things are spoken of thee,
thou city of God:” for not only is the Jewish nation, born of the flesh of Abraham, included
therein, but all nations also, some of which are named that all may be understood. “I will
think,” he says, “upon Rahab:” who is that harlot? That harlot in Jericho, who received the
spies and conducted them out of the city by a different road: who trusted beforehand in the
promise, who feared God, who was told to hang out of the window a line of scarlet thread,
that is, to bear upon her forehead the sign of the blood of Christ. She was saved there, and
thus represented the Church of the Gentiles: whence our Lord said to the haughty Pharisees,
“Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before
you.”4049 They go before, because they do violence: they push their way by faith, and to
faith a way is made, nor can any resist, since they who are violent take it by force. For it is
written, “The kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”4050
Such was the conduct of the robber, more courageous on the cross than in the place of am-
bush.4051 “I will think upon Rahab and Babylon.” By Babylon is meant the city of this world:
as there is one holy city, Jerusalem; one unholy, Babylon: all the unholy belong to Babylon,
even as all the holy to Jerusalem. But he slideth4052 from Babylon to Jerusalem. How, but
by Him who justifieth the ungodly: Jerusalem is the city of the saints; Babylon of the wicked:
but He cometh who justifieth the ungodly: since it is said, “I will think” not only “upon Ra-
hab,” but “upon Babylon,” but with whom? “with them that know Me.”…
6. Listen now to a deep mystery. Rahab is there through Him, through whom also is
Babylon, now no longer Babylon, but beginning to be Jerusalem. The daughter is divided
against her mother, and will be among the members of that queen to whom is said, “Forget
thine own people, and thy father’s house, so shall the king have pleasure in thy beauty.”4053
For how could Babylon aspire to Jerusalem? How could Rahab reach those foundations?
How could the Philistines, or Tyre, or the people of the Ethiopians? Listen to this verse,
“Sion, my mother, a man shall say.”4054 There is then a man who saith this: through whom
all those I have mentioned make their approach. Who is this man? It tells if we hear, if we
understand. It follows, as if a question had been raised, through whose aid Rahab, Babylon,
the Philistines, Tyre, and the Morians, gained an entrance. Behold, through whom they

come; “Sion, my mother, a man shall say; and a man was born in her, and Himself the Most
High hath founded her” (ver. 5). What, my brethren, can be clearer? Truly, because “very
excellent things are spoken of thee, thou city of God.” Lo, “Sion, O mother, a man shall say.”
What man? “He who was born in her.”4055 It is then the man who was born in her, and He
Himself hath founded her. Yet how can He be born in the city which He Himself founded?
It had already been founded, that therein He might be born. Understand it thus, if thou
canst: “Mother Sion, he shall say;” but it is “a man” that “shall say, Mother Sion; yea, a man
was born in her:” and yet “he hath founded her” (not a man, but), “the Most High.” As He
created a mother of whom He would be born, so He founded a city in which He would be
born. What hope is ours, brethren! On our behalf the Most High, who founded the city,
addresses that city as a mother: and “He was born in her, and the Most High hath founded
her.”
7. As though it were said, How do ye know this? All of us have sung these Psalms: and
Christ, Man for our sake, God before us, sings within us all. But is this much to say, “before
us,” of Him who was before heaven and earth and time? He then, born for our sakes a man,
in that city, also founded her when He was the Most High. Yet how are we assured of this?
“The Lord shall rehearse it when He writeth up the people” (ver. 6), as the following verse
has it. “The Lord shall declare, when He writeth up the people, and their princes.” What
princes?4056 “Those who were born in her;” those princes who, born within her walls, became
therein princes: for before they could become princes in her, God chose the despised things
of the world to confound the strong. Was the fisherman, the publican, a prince? They were
indeed princes: but because they became such in her. Princes of what kind were they? Princes
come from Babylon, believing monarchs of this world, came to the city of Rome, as to the
head of Babylon: they went not to the temple of the Emperor, but to the tomb of the Fisher-
man. Whence indeed did they rank as princes? “God chose the weak things of the world to
confound the strong, and the foolish things He hath chosen, and things which are not as
though they were, that things which are may be brought to nought.”4057 This He doth who
“from the ground raises the helpless, and from the dunghill exalts the poor.”4058 For what
purpose? “That He may set him with the princes, even with the princes of His people.”4059
This is a mighty deed, a deep source of pleasure and exultation. Orators came later into that
4055 Or, “He who was made man in her,” Qui homo factus est in ea.
4056 Et Principes is added in the text, but it has no equivalent in our version.

city, but they could never have done so, had not fishermen preceded them. These things are
glorious indeed, but where could they take place, but in that city of God, of whom very ex-
cellent things are spoken?
8. So thus, after drawing together and mingling every source of joyous exultation, how
doth he conclude? “The dwelling as of all that shall be made joyous is in Thee” (ver. 7). As
if all made joyous, all rejoicing, shall dwell in that city. Amid our journeyings here we suffer
bruises: our last home shall be the home of joy alone. Toil and groans shall perish: prayers
pass away, hymns of praise succeed. There shall be the dwelling of the happy; no longer
shall there be the groans of those that long, but the gladness of those who enjoy. For He will
be present for whom we sigh: we shall be like Him, as we shall see Him as He is:4060 there
it will be our whole task to praise and enjoy the presence of God: and what beyond shall we
ask for, when He alone satisfies us, by whom all things were made? We shall dwell and be
dwelt in; and shall be subject to Him, that God may be all in all.4061 “Blessed,” then, “are
they that dwell in Thy house.” How blessed? Blessed in their gold, and silver, their numerous
slaves, and multiplied offspring? “Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house: for ever and ever
they will be praising Thee.”4062 Blessed in that sole labour4063 which is rest! Let this then
be the one and only object of our desire, my brethren, when we shall have reached this pass.
Let, us prepare ourselves to rejoice in God: to praise Him. The good works which conduct
us thither, will not be needed there. I described, as far as I could, only yesterday,4064 our
condition there: works of charity there will be none, where there will be no misery: thou
shalt not find one in want, one naked, no one will meet you tormented with thirst, there
will be no stranger, no sick to visit, no dead to bury, no disputants to set at peace. What
then wilt thou find to do? Shall we plant new vines, plough, traffic, make voyages, to support
the necessities of the body? Deep quiet shall be there; all toilsome work, that necessity de-
mands, will cease: the necessity being dead, its works will perish too. What then will be our
state? As far as possible, the tongue of a man thus told us. “As it were, the dwelling of all
who shall be made perfect is in Thee.”4065 Why does he say, “as it were”? Because there shall
be such joy there as we know not here. Many pleasures do I behold here, and many rejoice
in this world, some in one thing, others in another; but there is nothing to compare with
that delight, but it shall be “as it were” being made joyful. For if I say joyfulness, men at once
think of such joyfulness as men use to have in wine, in feasting, in avarice, and in the world’s

distinctions. For men are elated by these things, and mad with a kind of joy: but “there is
no joy, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.”4066 There is a sort of joyfulness which the ear of
man hath not heard, nor his eye seen, nor hath it entered into his heart to conceive.4067 “As
it were, the dwelling of all who shall be made joyful is in Thee.” Let us prepare for other
delights: for a kind of shadow is what we find here, not the reality: that we may not expect
to enjoy such things there as here we delight in: otherwise our self-denial will be avarice.
Some persons, when invited to a rich banquet, where there are many and costly dishes yet
to come on, abstain from breaking their fast: if you ask the reason, they tell you that they
are fasting: which is indeed a great work, a Christian work. Yet be not hasty in praising
them: examine their motives: it is their belly, not religion, that they are consulting. That
their appetite may not be palled by ordinary dishes, they abstain till more delicate food is
set before them. This fast then is for the gullet’s sake. Fasting is undoubtedly important: it
fights against the belly and the palate; but sometimes it fights for them. Thus, my brethren,
if ye imagine that we shall find any such pleasures in that country to which the heavenly
trumpet urges us on, and on that account abstain from present enjoyments, that ye may
receive the like more plentifully there, ye imitate those I have described, who fast only for
greater feasting, and abstain only for greater indulgence. Do not ye like this: prepare
yourselves for a certain ineffable delight: cleanse your hearts from all earthly and secular
affections. We shall see something, the sight of which will make us blessed: and that alone
will suffice for us. What then? Shall we not eat? Yes: we shall eat: but that shall be our food,
which will ever refresh, and never fail. “In Thee is the dwelling of all who shall be, as it were,
made joyful.” He has already told us how we shall be made joyful. “Blessed are they that
dwell in thy house: for ever and ever they will be praising Thee.”4068 Let us praise the Lord
as far as we are able, but with mingled lamentations: for while we praise we long for Him,
and as yet have Him not. When we have, all our sorrows will be taken from us, and nothing
will remain but praise, unmixed and everlasting. Now let us pray.4069

Psalm LXXXVII
Psalm LXXXVIII.4070
1. The Title of this eighty-seventh Psalm contains a fresh subject for enquiry: the words
occurring here, “for Melech to respond,” being nowhere else found. We have already given
our opinion on the meaning of the titles Psalmus Cantici and Canticum Psalmi:4071 and
the words, “sons of Core,” are constantly repeated, and have often been explained: so also
“to the end;” but what comes next in this title is peculiar. For “Melech” we may translate
into Latin “for the chorus,” for chorus is the sense of the Hebrew word Melech.4072…The
Passion of our Lord is here prophesied. Now the Apostle Peter saith, “Christ also suffered
for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps;”4073 this is the meaning of
“to respond.” The Apostle John also saith, “As Christ laid down His life for us, so ought we
also to lay down our lives for the brethren;”4074 this also is to respond. But the choir signifies
concord, which consists in charity: whoever therefore in imitation of our Lord’s Passion
gives up his body to be burnt, if he have not charity, does not answer in the choir, and
therefore it profiteth him nothing.4075 Further, as in Latin the terms Precentor and Succentor
are used to denote in music the performer who sings the first part, and him who takes it up;
just so in this song of the Passion, Christ going before is followed by the choir of martyrs
unto the end of gaining crowns in Heaven. This is sung by “the sons of Core,” that is, the
imitators of Christ’s Passion: as Christ was crucified in Calvary, which is the interpretation
of the Hebrew word Core. 4076 This also is “the understanding of Æman the Israelite:”4077

4072 [The author here adds: “What other meaning then can we attach to the words, ‘for the chorus to respond,’
but this, that the choir is to make responses with the singer? And thus we must suppose that not this only, but
other Psalms were chanted, though they have received different titles, probably for the sake of variety to relieve
weariness: for this Psalm was not the only one held worthy of choral responses, since it is not the only one which
relates to our Lord’s Passion. If indeed there is any other reason for so great a variety in the titles, by which it
can be shown that all the Psalms which are distinguished in their titles are so marked, as that the title of no one
of them can be fitted to another, I must confess that I could not discover it, though I tried long; and whatever I
have read on the subject in the works of my predecessors has not satisfied my hopes, or, perhaps, my slowness
of apprehension. I will therefore explain in allusion to what mystery the words, ‘for the choir to respond,’ that
is, that the singer should be answered by a choir, seem to me to be used.”—C.]

words occurring at the end of this title. Æman is said to mean, “his brother:” for Christ
deigns to make those His brethren, who understand the mystery of His Cross, and not only
are not ashamed of it, but faithfully glory in it, not praising themselves for their own merits,
but grateful for His grace: so that it may be said to each of them, “Behold an Israelite indeed,
in whom there is no guile,”4078 just as holy Scripture says of Israel himself, that he was
without guile.4079
2. “O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before Thee” (ver. 1). Let us
therefore now hear the voice of Christ singing before us in prophecy, to whom His own
choir should respond either in imitation, or in thanksgiving.
“O let my prayer enter into Thy presence, incline Thine ear unto my calling” (ver. 2).
For even our Lord prayed, not in the form of God, but in the form of a servant; for in this
He also suffered. He prayed both in prosperous times, that is, by “day,” and in calamity,
which I imagine is meant by “night.” The entrance of prayer into God’s presence is its ac-
ceptance: the inclination of His ear is His compassionate listening to it: for God has not
such bodily members as we have. The passage is however, as usual, a repetition.4080
3. “For my soul is filled with evils, and my life draweth nigh unto hell” (ver. 3). Dare we
speak of the Soul of Christ as “filled with evils,” when the passion had strength as far as it
had any, only over the body?…The soul therefore may feel pain without the body: but
without the soul the body cannot. Why therefore should we not say that the Soul of Christ
was full of the evils of humanity, though not of human sins? Another Prophet says of Him,
that He grieved for us:4081 and the Evangelist says, “And He took with Him Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy:” and our Lord Himself
saith unto them of Himself, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.”4082 The
Prophet who composed this Psalm, foreseeing that this would happen, introduces Him
saying, “My soul is full of evils, and My life draweth nigh unto hell.” For the very same sense
is here expressed in other words, as when He said, “My soul is sorrowful, even unto death.”
The words, “My soul is sorrowful,” are like these, “My soul is full of evils:” and what follows,
“even unto death,” like, “my life draweth nigh unto hell.” These feelings of human infirmity
our Lord took upon Him, as He did the flesh of human infirmity, and the death of human
flesh, not by the necessity of His condition, but by the free will of His mercy, that He might
transfigure into Himself His own body, which is the Church (the head of which He deigned

to be), that is, His members in His holy and faithful disciples: that if amid human temptations
any one among them happened to be in sorrow and pain, he might not therefore think that
he was separated from His favour: that the body, like the chorus following its leader, might
learn from its Head, that these sorrows were not sin, but proofs of human weakness. We
read of the Apostle Paul, a chief member in this body, and we hear him confessing that his
soul was full of such evils, when he says, that he feels “great heaviness and continual sorrow
in heart for his brethren according to the flesh, who are Israelites.”4083 And if we say that
our Lord was sorrowful for them also at the approach of His Passion, in which they would
incur the most atrocious guilt, I think we shall not speak amiss. Lastly, the very thing said
by our Saviour on the Cross, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,”4084
is expressed in this Psalm below, “I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit”
(ver. 4): by them who knew not what they were doing, when they imagined that He died
like other men, subjected to necessity, and overcome by it. The word “pit” is used for the
depth of woe or of Hell. “I have been as a man that hath no help.”
4. “Free among the dead” (ver. 5). In these words our Lord’s Person is most clearly
shown: for who else is free among the dead but He who though in the likeness of sinful flesh
is alone among sinners without sin?4085…He therefore, “free among the dead,” who had it
in His power to lay down His life, and again to take it; from whom no one could take it, but
He laid it down of His own free will; who could revive His own flesh, as a temple destroyed
by them, at His will; who, when all had forsaken Him on the eve of His Passion, remained
not alone, because, as He testifies, His Father forsook Him not;4086 was nevertheless by His
enemies, for whom He prayed, who knew not what they did, …counted “as one who hath
no help; like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave.” But he adds, “Whom thou
dost not yet remember:” and in these words there is to be remarked a distinction between
Christ and the rest of the dead. For though He was wounded, and when dead laid in the
tomb,4087 yet they who knew not what they were doing, or who He was, regarded Him as
like others who had perished from their wounds, and who slept in the tomb, who are as yet
out of remembrance of God, that is, whose hour of resurrection has not yet arrived. For
thus the Scripture speaks of the dead as sleeping, because it wishes them to be regarded as
destined to awake, that is, to rise again. But He, wounded and asleep in the tomb, awoke on
the third day, and became “like a sparrow that sitteth alone on the housetop,”4088 that is,

Psalm LXXXVIII
on the right hand of His Father in Heaven: and now “dieth no more, death shall no more
have dominion over Him.”4089 Hence He differs widely from those whom God hath not
yet remembered to cause their resurrection after this manner: for what was to go before in
the Head, was kept for the Body in the end. God is then said to remember, when He does
an act: then to forget, when He does it not: for neither can God forget, as He never changes,
nor remember, as He can never forget. “I am counted” then, by those who know not what
they do, “as a man that hath no help:” while I am “free among the dead,” I am held by these
men “like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave.” Yet those very men, who account
thus of Me, are further said to be “cut away from Thy hand,” that is, when I was made so
by them, “they were cut away from Thy hand;” they who believed Me destitute of help, are
deprived of the help of Thy hand: for they, as he saith in another Psalm,4090 have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves. I prefer this interpretation to
that which refers the words, “they are cut away from Thy hand,” to those who sleep in the
tomb, whom God hath not yet remembered: since the righteous are among the latter, of
whom, even though God hath not yet called them to the resurrection, it is said, that their
“souls are in the hands of God,”4091 that is, that “they dwell under the defence of the Most
High; and shall abide under the shadow of the God of Heaven.”4092 But it is those who are
cut away from the hand of God, who believed that Christ was cut off from His hand, and
thus accounting Him among the wicked, dared to slay Him.
5. “They laid Me in the lowest pit” (ver. 6), that is, the deepest pit. For so it is in the
Greek. But what is the lowest pit, but the deepest woe, than which there is none more deep?
Whence in another Psalm it is said, “Thou broughtest me out also of the pit of misery.”4093
“In a place of darkness, and in the shadow of death,” whiles they knew not what they did,
they laid Him there, thus deeming of Him; they knew not Him “whom none of the princes
of this world knew.”4094 By the “shadow of death,” I know not whether the death of the
body is to be understood, or that of which it is written, “That they walked in darkness and
in the land of the shadow of death, a light is risen on them,”4095 because by belief they were
brought from out of the darkness and death of sin into light and life. Such an one those who
knew not what they did thought our Lord, and in their ignorance accounted Him among
those whom He came to help, that they might not be such themselves.

Psalm LXXXVIII
6. “Thy indignation lieth hard upon Me” (ver. 7), or, as other copies have it, “Thy anger;”
or, as others, “Thy fury:” the Greek word θυμὸς having undergone different interpretations.
For where the Greek copies have ὀργὴ, no translator hesitated to express it by the Latin ira;
but where the word is θυμὸς, most object to rendering it by ira, although many of the authors
of the best Latin style, in their translations from Greek philosophy, have thus rendered the
word in Latin. But I shall not discuss this matter further: only if I also were to suggest another
term, I should think “indignation” more tolerable than “fury,” this word in Latin not being
applied to persons in their senses. What then does this mean, “Thy indignation lieth hard
upon Me,” except the belief of those, who knew not the Lord of Glory?4096 who imagined
that the anger of God was not merely roused, but lay hard upon Him, whom they dared to
bring to death, and not only death, but that kind, which they regarded as the most execrable
of all, namely, the death of the Cross: whence saith the Apostle, “Christ hath redeemed us
from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one
that hangeth upon a tree.”4097 On this account, wishing to praise His obedience which He
carried to the extreme of humility, he says, “He humbled Himself, and became obedient
unto death;” and as this seemed little, he added, “even the death of the Cross;”4098 and with
the same view as far as I can see, he says in this Psalm, “And all thy suspensions,” or, as some
translate “waves,” others “tossings,” “Thou hast brought over Me.” We also find in another
Psalm, “All thy suspensions and waves are come in upon Me,”4099 or, as some have translated
better, “have passed over Me:” for it is διῆλθον in Greek, not εἰσῆλθον: and where both
expressions are employed, “waves” and “suspensions,” one cannot be used as equivalent to
the other. In that passage we explained “suspensions” as threatenings, “waves” as the actual
sufferings: both inflicted by God’s judgment: but in that place it is said, “All have passed
over Me,” here, “Thou hast brought all upon Me.” In the other case, that is, although some
evils took place, yet, he said, all those which are here mentioned passed over; but in this
case, “Thou hast brought them upon Me.” Evils pass over when they do not touch a man,
as things which hang over him, or when they do touch him, as waves. But when he uses the
word “suspensions,” he does not say they passed over, but, “Thou hast brought them upon
Me,” meaning that all which impended had come to pass. All things which were predicted
of His Passion impended, as long as they remained in the prophecies for future fulfilment.
7. “Thou hast put Mine acquaintance far from Me” (ver. 8). If we understand by acquaint-
ance those whom He knew, it will be all men; for whom knew He not? But He calls those
acquaintance, to whom He was Himself known, as far as they could know Him at that season:

4097 Gal. iii. 13.
4098 Phil. ii. 8.
4099 Ps. xlii. 7.
Psalm LXXXVIII
at least so far forth as they knew Him to be innocent, although they considered Him only
as a man, not as likewise God. Although He might call the righteous whom He approved,
acquaintance, as He calls the wicked unknown, to whom He was to say at the end, “I know
you not.”4100 In what follows, “and they have set Me for an abhorrence to themselves;” those
whom He called before “acquaintance,” may be meant, as even they felt horror at the mode
of that death: but it is better referred to those of whom He was speaking above as His perse-
cutors. “I was delivered up, and did not get forth.” Is this because His disciples were without,
while He was being tried within?4101 Or are we to give a deeper meaning to the words, “I
cannot get forth” as signifying, “I remained hidden in My secret counsels, I showed not who
I was, I did not reveal Myself, was not made manifest”? And so it follows,—
“My eyes became weak from want” (ver. 9). For what eyes are we to understand? If the
eyes of the flesh in which He suffered, we do not read that His eyes became weak from want,
that is, from hunger, in His Passion, as is often the case; as He was betrayed after His Supper,
and crucified on the same day: if the inner eyes, how were they weakened from want, in
which there was a light that could never fail? But He meant by His eyes those members in
the body, of which He was Himself the head, which, as brighter and more eminent and chief
above the rest, He loved. It was of this body that the Apostle was speaking, when he wrote,
taking his metaphor from our own body, “If the whole body were an eye, where were the
hearing?” etc.4102 What he wished understood by these words, he has expressed more clearly,
by adding, “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”4103 Wherefore as
those eyes, that is, the holy Apostles, to whom not flesh and blood, but the Father which is
in Heaven had revealed Him, so that Peter said, “Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living
God,”4104 when they saw Him betrayed, and suffering such evils, saw Him not such as they
wished, as He did not come forth, did not manifest Himself in His virtue and power, but
still hidden in His secrecy,4105 endured everything as a man overcome and enfeebled, they
became weak for want, as if their food, their Light, had been withdrawn from them.
8. He continues, “And I have called upon Thee.” This indeed He did most clearly, when
upon the Cross. But what follows? “All the day I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee,”
must be examined how it must be taken. For if in this expression we understand the tree of
the Cross, how can we reconcile it with the “whole day”? Can He be said to have hung upon
the Cross during the whole day, as the night is considered a part of the day? But if day, as

opposed to night, was meant by this expression, even of this day, the first and no small
portion had passed by at the time of His crucifixion. But if we take “day” in the same sense
of time (especially as the word is used in the feminine, a gender which is restricted to that
sense in Latin, although not so in Greek, as it is always used in the feminine, which I suppose
to be the reason for its translation in the same gender in our own version), the knot of the
question will be drawn tighter: for how can it mean for the whole space of time, if He did
not even for one day stretch forth His hands on the Cross? Further, should we take the whole
for a part, as Scripture sometimes uses this expression, I do not remember an instance in
which the whole is taken for a part, when the word “whole” is expressly added. For in the
passage of the Gospel where the Lord saith, “The Son of Man shall be three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth,” 4106 it is no extraordinary licence to take the whole for the
part, the expression not being for three “whole” days and three whole nights: since the one
intermediate day was a whole one, the other two were parts, the last being part of the first
day, the first part of the last. But if the Cross is not meant here, but the prayer, which we
find in the Gospel that He poured forth in the form of a servant to God the Father, where
He is said to have prayed long before His Passion, and on the eve of His Passion, and also
when on the Cross, we do not read anywhere that He did so throughout the whole day.
Therefore by the stretched-out hands throughout the whole day, we may understand the
continuation of good works in which He never ceased from exertion.
9. But as His good works profited only the predestined to eternal salvation, and not all
men, nor even all those among whom they were done, he adds, “Dost thou show wonders
among the dead?” (ver. 10). If we suppose this relates to those whose flesh life has left, great
wonders have been wrought among the dead, inasmuch as some of them have revived:4107
and in our Lord’s descent into Hell, and His ascent as the conqueror of death, a great wonder
was wrought among the dead. He refers then in these words, “Dost Thou show wonders
among the dead?” to men so dead in heart, that such great works of Christ could not rouse
them to the life of faith: for he does not say that wonders are not shown to them because
they see them not, but because they do not profit them. For, as he says in this passage, “the
whole day have I stretched forth My hands to Thee:” because He ever refers all His works
to the will of His Father, constantly declaring that He came to fulfil His Father’s will:4108 so
also, as an unbelieving people saw the same works, another Prophet saith, “I have spread
out my hands all day unto a rebellious people, that believes not, but contradicts.”4109 Those
then are dead, to whom wonders have not been shown, not because they saw them not, but

4107 Matt. xxvii. 52.

Psalm LXXXVIII
since they lived not again through them. The following verse, “Shall physicians revive them,
and shall they praise Thee?” means, that the dead shall not be revived by such means, that
they may praise Thee. In the Hebrew there is said to be a different expression: giants being
used where physicians are here: but the Septuagint translators, whose authority is such that
they may deservedly be said to have interpreted by the inspiration of the Spirit of God owing
to their wonderful agreement, conclude, not by mistake, but taking occasion from the re-
semblance in sound between the Hebrew words expressing these two senses, that the use of
the word is an indication of the sense in which the word giants is meant to be taken. For if
you suppose the proud meant by giants, of whom the Apostle saith, “Where is the wise?
where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world?” 4110 there is no incongruity in
calling them physicians, as if by their own unaided skill they promised the salvation of souls:
against whom it is said, “Of the Lord is safety.”4111 But if we take the word giant in a good
sense, as it is said of our Lord, “He rejoiceth as a giant to run his course;”4112 that is Giant
of giants, chief among the greatest and strongest, who in His Church excel in spiritual
strength. Just as He is the Mountain of mountains; as it is written, “And it shall come to
pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be manifested in the top
of the mountains:”4113 and the Saint of saints: there is no absurdity in styling these same
great and mighty men physicians. Whence saith the Apostle, “if by any means I may provoke
to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.”4114 But even such
physicians, even though they cure not by their own power (as not even of their own do those
of the body), yet so far forth as by faithful ministry they assist towards salvation, can cure
the living, but not raise the dead: of whom it is said, “Dost Thou show wonders among the
dead?” For the grace of God, by which men’s minds in a certain manner are brought to live
a fresh life, so as to be able to hear the lessons of salvation from any of its ministers whatever,
is most hidden and mysterious. This grace is thus spoken of in the Gospel. “No man can
come to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw him;”4115…in order to show, that
the very faith by which the soul believes, and springs into fresh life from the death of its
former affections, is given us by God. Whatever exertions, then, the best preachers of the
word,4116 and persuaders of the truth through miracles, may make with men, just like great
physicians: yet if they are dead, and through Thy grace have not a second life, “Dost Thou

show wonders among the dead, or shall physicians raise them? and shall they” whom they
raise “praise Thee”? For this confession declares that they live: not, as it is written elsewhere,
“Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not.”4117
10. “Shall one show Thy loving-kindness in the grave, or Thy faithfulness in destruction?”
(ver. 11). The word “show” is of course understood as if repeated, Shall any show Thy
faithfulness in destruction? Scripture loves to connect loving-kindness and faithfulness, es-
pecially in the Psalms. “Destruction” also is a repetition of “the grave,” and signifies them
who are in the grave, styled above “the dead,” in the verse, “Dost thou show wonders among
the dead?” for the body is the grave of the dead soul; whence our Lord’s words in the Gospel,
“Ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but within are
full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye outwardly appear righteous
unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.”4118
11. “Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark, and thy righteousness in the land
where all things are forgotten?” (ver. 12), the dark answers to the land of forgetfulness: for
the unbelieving are meant by the dark, as the Apostle saith, “For ye were sometimes dark-
ness;”4119 and the land where all things are forgotten, is the man who has forgotten God;
for the unbelieving soul can arrive at darkness so intense, “that the fool saith in his heart,
There is no God.”4120 Thus the meaning of the whole passage may thus be drawn out in its
connection: “Lord, I have called upon Thee,” amid My sufferings; “all day I have stretched
forth my hands unto Thee” (ver. 13). I have never ceased to stretch forth My works to
glorify Thee. Why then do the wicked rage against Me, unless because “Thou showest not
wonders among the dead”? because those wonders move them not to faith, nor can physicians
restore them to life that they may praise Thee, because Thy hidden grace works not in them
to draw them unto believing: because no man cometh unto Me, but whom Thou hast drawn.
Shall then “Thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave”? that is, the grave of the dead soul,
which lies dead beneath the body’s weight: “or Thy faithfulness in destruction”? that is, in
such a death as cannot believe or feel any of these things. “For how then in the darkness”
of this death, that is, in the man who in forgetting Thee has lost the light of his life, “shall
Thy wondrous works and Thy righteousness be known.”…
12. But that those prayers, the blessings of which surpass all words, may be more fervent
and more constant, the gift that shall last unto eternity is deferred, while transitory evils are
allowed to thicken. And so it follows: “Lord, why hast Thou cast off my prayer?” (ver. 14),
which may be compared with another Psalm:4121 “My God, My God, look upon me; why
4117 Ecclus. xvii. 26.
4118 Matt. xxiii. 27, 28.
4119 Eph. v. 8.
4120 Ps. xiv. 1.
4121 Ps. xxii. 1.
Psalm LXXXVIII
hast Thou forsaken me?” The reason is made matter of question, not as if the wisdom of
God were blamed as doing so without a cause; and so here. “Lord, why hast Thou cast off
my prayer?” But if this cause be attended to carefully, it will be found indicated above; for
it is with the view that the prayers of the Saints are, as it were, repelled by the delay of so
great a blessing, and by the adversity they encounter in the troubles of life, that the flame,
thus fanned, may burst into a brighter blaze.
13. For this purpose he briefly sketches in what follows the troubles of Christ’s body.
For it is not in the Head alone that they took place, since it is said to Saul too, “Why perse-
cutest thou Me?”4122 and Paul himself, as if placed as an elect member in the same body,
saith, “That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.”4123
“Why then, Lord, hast Thou cast off my soul? why hidest Thou Thy face from me?”
“I am poor, and in toils from my youth up: and when lifted up, I was thrown down, and
troubled” (ver. 15).
“Thy wraths went over me: Thy terrors disturbed me” (ver. 16).
“They came round about me all day like water: they compassed me about together” (ver.
17).
“A friend Thou hast put far from me: and mine acquaintance from my misery” (ver.
18). All these evils have taken place, and are happening in the limbs of Christ’s body, and
God turns away His face from their prayers, by not hearing as to what they wish for, since
they know not that the fulfilment of their wishes would not be good for them. The Church
is “poor,” as she hungers and thirsts in her wanderings for that food with which she shall
be filled in her own country: she is “in toils from her youth up,” as the very Body of Christ
saith in another Psalm, “Many a time have they overcome me from my youth.”4124 And for
this reason some of her members are lifted up even in this world, that in them may be the
greater lowliness. Over that Body, which constitutes the unity of the Saints and the faithful,
whose Head is Christ, go the wraths of God: yet abide not: since it is of the unbelieving only
that it is written, that “the wrath of God abideth upon him.”4125 The terrors of God disturb
the weakness of the faithful, because all that can happen, even though it actually happen
not, it is prudent to fear; and sometimes these terrors so agitate the reflecting soul with the
evils impending around, that they seem to flow around us on every side like water, and to
encircle us in our fears. And as the Church while on pilgrimage is never free from these
evils, happening as they do at one moment in one of her limbs, at another in another, he
adds, “all day,” signifying the continuation in time, to the end of this world. Often too,
4122 Acts ix. 4.
4123 Col. i. 24.
4124 Ps. cxxix. 1.
4125 John iii. 36.
Psalm LXXXVIII
friends and acquaintances, their worldly interests at stake, in their terror forsake the Saints;
of which saith the Apostle, “all men forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.”4126 But
to what purpose is all this, but that early in the morning, that is, after the night of unbelief,
the prayers of this holy Body may in the light of faith prevent God, until the coming of that
salvation, which we are at present saved by hoping for, not by having, while we await it with
patience and faithfulness. Then the Lord will not repel our prayers, as there will no longer
be anything to be sought for, but everything that has been rightly asked, will be obtained:
nor will He turn His face away from us, since we shall see Him as He is:4127 nor shall we be
poor, because God will be our abundance, all in all:4128 nor shall we suffer, as there will be
no more weakness: nor after exaltation shall we meet with humiliation and confusion, as
there will be no adversity there: nor bear even the transient wrath of God, as we shall abide
in His abiding love: nor will His terrors agitate us, because His promises realized will bless
us: nor will our friend and acquaintance, being terrified, be far from us, where there will be
no foe to dread.

Psalm LXXXVIII
Psalm LXXXIX.4129
1. Understand, beloved, this Psalm, which I am about to explain, by the grace of God,
of our hope in the Lord Jesus Christ, and be of good cheer, because He who promised, will
fulfil all, as He has fulfilled much: for it is not our own merit, but His mercy, that gives us
confidence in Him. He Himself is meant, in my belief, by “the understanding of Æthan the
Israelite:”4130 which has given this Psalm its title. You see then, who is meant by Æthan:
but the meaning of the word is “strong.” No man in this world is strong, except in the hope
of God’s promises: for as to our own deservings, we are weak, in His mercy we are strong.
Weak then in himself, strong in God’s mercy, the Psalmist thus begins: “I will sing of Thy
mercies, O Lord, for ever: with my mouth will I make known Thy truth unto all generations”
(ver. 1).
2. Let my limbs, he saith, serve the Lord: I speak, but it is of Thine I speak. “With my
mouth will I make known Thy truth:” if I obey not Thee, I am not Thy servant: if I speak
on my own part, I am a liar. To speak then from Thee,4131 and in my own person, are two
things: one mine, one Thine: Truth Thine, language mine. Let us hear then what faithfulness
he maketh known, what mercies he singeth.
3. “For Thou hast said, Mercy shall be built up for ever” (ver. 2). It is this that I sing:
this is Thy truth, for the making known of which my mouth serveth. In such wise Thou
sayest, I build, as not to destroy: for some Thou destroyest and buildest not; and some whom
Thou destroyest Thou dost rebuild. For unless there were some who were destroyed to be
rebuilt, Jeremiah would not have written, “See, I have this day set thee to throw down and
to build.”4132 And indeed all who formerly worshipped images and stones could not be built
up in Christ, without being destroyed as to their old error. While, unless some were destroyed
not to be built up, it would not be written, “He shall destroy them, and not build them
up.”4133… In what follows, he joins these two words, mercy and faithfulness; “For Thou
hast said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: Thy truth shall be established in the Heavens:”
in which mercy and truth are repeated, “for all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth,”4134
for truth in the fulfilment of promises could not be shown, unless mercy in the remission

of sins preceded. Next, as many things were promised in prophecy even to the people of
Israel that came according to the flesh from the seed of Abraham, and that people was in-
creased that the promises of God might be fulfilled in it; while yet God did not close the
fountain of His goodness even to the Gentiles, whom He had placed under the rule of the
Angels, while He reserved the people of Israel as His own portion: the Apostle expressly
mentions the Lord’s mercy and truth as referring to these two parties. For he calls Christ “a
minister of the Circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
fathers.”4135 See how God deceived not; see how He cast not off His people, whom He
foreknew. For while the Apostle is treating of the fall of the Jews, to prevent any from believ-
ing them so far disowned4136 of God, that no wheat from that floor’s fanning could reach
the granary, he saith, “God hath not cast away His people, whom He foreknew; for I also
am an Israelite.”4137 If all that nation are thorns, how am I who speak unto you wheat? So
that the truth of God was fulfilled in those Israelites who believed, and one wall from the
circumcision is thus brought to meet the corner stone. But this stone would not form a
corner, unless it received another wall from the Gentiles: so that the former wall relates in
a special manner to the truth, the latter to the mercy of God. “Now I say,” says the Apostle,
“that Jesus Christ was a minister of the Circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the
promise made unto the fathers: and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy.”4138
Justly then is it added, “Thy truth shalt Thou stablish in the Heavens:” for all those Israelites
who were called to be Apostles became as Heavens which declare the glory of God: as it is
written by them, “The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His
handywork.”4139…Since, although they were taken up from hence before the Church filled
the whole world, yet as “their words reached to the ends of the world,” we are right in sup-
posing this which we have just read, “Thy truth shalt Thou stablish in the Heavens,” fulfilled
in them.
4. “Thou hast said, I have made a covenant with My chosen” (ver. 3). What covenant,
but the new, by which we are renewed to a fresh inheritance, in our longing desire and love
of which we sing a new song. “I have made a covenant with My chosen,” saith the Psalmist:
“I have sworn unto David My servant.” How confidently does he speak, who understands,
whose mouth serves truth! I speak without fear; since “Thou hast said.” If Thou makest me
fearless, because Thou hast said, how much more so dost Thou make me, when Thou hast
sworn! For the oath of God is the assurance of a promise. Man is justly forbidden to swear:4140

4140 Matt. v. 34.
Psalm LXXXIX
lest by the habit of swearing, since a man may be deceived, he fall into perjury. God alone
swears securely, because He alone is infallible.
5. Let us see then what God hath sworn. “I have sworn,” He saith, “to David My servant;
thy seed will I establish for ever” (ver. 4). But what is the seed of David, but that of Abraham.
And what is the seed of Abraham? “And to thy seed,” He saith, “which is Christ.”4141 But
perhaps that Christ, the Head of the Church, the Saviour of the body,4142 is the seed of
Abraham, and therefore of David; but we are not Abraham’s seed? We are assuredly; as the
Apostle saith, “And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the
promise.”4143 In this sense, then, let us take the words, brethren, “Thy seed will I stablish
for ever,” not only of that Flesh of Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, but also of all of us who
believe in Christ, for we are limbs of that Head. This body cannot be deprived of its Head:
if the Head is in glory for ever, so are the limbs, so that Christ remains entire for ever. “Thy
seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne to generation and generation.” We suppose
he saith, “for ever,” because it is “to generation and generation:” since he has said above,
with “my mouth will I ever be showing Thy truth to generation and generation.” What is
“to generation and generation”? To every generation: for the word needed not as many re-
petitions, as the coming and passing away of the several generations. The multiplication of
generations is signified and set forth to notice by the repetition. Are possibly two generations
to be understood, as ye are aware, my beloved brethren, and as I have before explained? for
there is now a generation of flesh and blood: there will be a future generation in the resur-
rection of the dead. Christ is proclaimed here: He will be proclaimed4144 there: here He is
proclaimed, that He may be believed in: there, He will be welcomed, that He may be seen.
“I will set up Thy throne from one generation to another.” Christ hath now a throne in us,
His throne is set up in us: for unless he sat enthroned within us, He would not rule us: but
if we were not ruled by Him, we should be thrown down by ourselves. He therefore sits
within us, reigning over us: He sits also in another generation, which will come from the
resurrection of the dead. Christ will reign for ever over His Saints. God has promised this;
He hath said it: if this is not enough, God hath sworn it. As then the promise is certain, not
on account of our deservings, but of His pity, no one ought to be afraid in proclaiming that
which he cannot doubt of. Let that strength then inspire our hearts, whence Æthan received
his name, “strong in heart:” let us preach the truth of God, the utterance of God, His
promises, His oath; and let us, strengthened on every side by these means, glorify God, and
by bearing Him along with us, become Heavens.

Psalm LXXXIX
6. “O Lord, the very Heavens shall praise Thy wondrous works” (ver. 5). The Heavens
will not praise their own merits, but Thy wondrous works, O Lord. For in every act of mercy
on the lost, of justification of the unrighteous, what do we praise but the wondrous works
of God? Thou praisest Him, because the dead have risen: praise Him yet more, because the
lost are redeemed. What grace, what mercy of God! Thou seest a man yesterday a whirlpool
of drunkenness, to-day an ornament of sobriety: a man yesterday the sink of luxury, to-day
the beauty of temperance: yesterday a blasphemer of God, to-day His praiser: yesterday the
slave of the creature, to-day the worshipper of the Creator. From all these desperate states
men are thus converted: let them not look at their own merits: let them become Heavens,
and praise the wondrous works of Him by whom they were made Heavens.…
7. “For who is he among the clouds, who shall be compared unto Thee, Lord!” (ver. 6).
Is this to be the praise of the Heavens, is this to be their rain? What? are the preachers con-
fident, because “none among the clouds shall be compared unto the Lord”? Does it appear
to you, brethren, a high ground of praise, that the clouds cannot be compared with their
Creator? If it is taken in its literal, not in its mystical meaning, it is not so: what? are the stars
that are above the clouds to be compared with the Lord? what? can the Sun, Moon, Angels,
Heavens, be even compared with the Lord? Why is it then that he says, as if he meant some
high praise, “For who is he among the clouds?” etc. We understand, my brethren, those
clouds, as the Heavens, to be the preachers of truth; Prophets, Apostles, the announcers of
the word of God.…If therefore the clouds are the preachers of the truth, let us first enquire
why they are clouds. For the same men are Heavens and clouds: Heavens from the brightness
of the truth, clouds from the hidden things of the flesh: for all clouds are obscure, owing to
their mortality: and they come and go. It is on account of these very obscurities of the flesh,
that is, of the clouds, that the Apostle saith, “Therefore judge nothing before the time, until
the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness.” 4145 You see at this
moment what a man is saying: but what he has in his heart, you cannot see: what is forced
from the cloud, you see, what is kept within the cloud, you see not. For whose eyes pierce
the cloud? The clouds therefore are the preachers of the truth in the flesh. The Creator of
all things Himself came in the flesh.…We are called clouds on account of the flesh, and we
are preachers of the truth on account of the showers of the clouds: but our flesh comes in
one way, His by another. We too are called sons of God, but He is the Son of God in another
sense. His cloud comes from a Virgin, He is the Son from eternity, co-eternal4146 with the
Father. “Who is he then among the clouds, that shall be compared unto the Lord? and what
is he among the sons of God, that shall be like unto the Lord?” Let the Lord Himself say
whether He can find one like unto Himself. “Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am?”
4145 1 Cor. iv. 5.

Psalm LXXXIX
Because I appear, because I am seen, because I walk among you, and perhaps at present I
am become common; say, whom do men say that I the Son of Man am? Surely when they
see a son of man, they see a cloud; but say, “Whom do men say that I am?” In answer they
gave Him the reports of men; “Some say that Thou art John the Baptist: some Elias, and
others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.” Many clouds and sons of God are here mentioned:
for because they were righteous and holy, as the sons of God, Jeremias, Elias, and John are
called also sons of God: in their character of preachers of God, they are styled clouds. Ye
have said what clouds men imagine Me to be: do ye too say, “Whom say ye that I am?” Peter
replying in behalf of all, one for those who were one,4147 answered, “Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God;”4148 not like those sons of God who are not made equal to Thee:
Thou hast come in the flesh: but not as the clouds, who are not to be compared unto Thee.
8. …“God is very greatly to be feared in the counsel of the righteous, and to be had in
dread of all them that are round about Him” (ver. 7). God is everywhere; who therefore are
round about Him, who is everywhere? For if He has some round about Him, He is repres-
ented as finite on every side. Moreover, if it is truly said to God4149 and of God, “of His
greatness there is no end;”4150 who remain, who are round about Him, except because He
who is everywhere, chose to be born of the flesh on one spot, to dwell among one nation,
in one place to be crucified, from one spot to rise again and ascend into Heaven. Where He
did this, the Gentiles are round about Him. If He remained where He did these things, He
would not be “great, and be had in dread of all them that are round about Him;” but since
He preached when there in such a manner as to send preachers of His own name through
all nations over the whole world; by working miracles among His servants, He is become
“great, and to be had in dread of all them that are round about Him.”
9. “O Lord God of Hosts, who is like unto Thee? Thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side” (ver. 8). Great is Thy power: Thou hast made Heaven and earth, and all things
that in them are: but greater still is thy loving-kindness, which has shown forth Thy truth
to all around Thee. For if Thou hadst been preached only on the spot where Thou didst
deign to be born, to suffer, to rise again, to ascend; the truth of that promise of God would
have been fulfilled, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: but the promise, “that
the Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy,”4151 would not have been fulfilled, had not that
truth been explained, and diffused to those around Thee from the spot where Thou didst
deign to appear. On that spot Thou didst thunder out of Thy own cloud: but to scatter rain

“Thy truth” then “is in the circuit of Thee.” But when without persecutions, when without
opposition, since it is said, that “He was born for a sign which shall be spoken against”?4153
Since then that nation, where Thou didst deign to be born, and to dwell, was as a land sep-
arated from the waves of the heathen, so that it appeared dry and ready for watering with
rain, while the rest of the nations were as a sea in the bitterness of their sterility; what do
Thy preachers who scatter Thy truth in circuit of Thee, when the waves of that sea rage
furiously? “Thou rulest the power of the sea” (ver. 9). For what was the result of the sea raging
thus, but the day which we are now keeping holy? It slew Martyrs, scattered seeds of blood,
the harvest of the Church sprang up. Safely then let the clouds go forth: let them diffuse Thy
truth in circuit of Thee, let them not fear the savage waves. “Thou rulest the power of the
sea.” The sea swells, buffets, and roars: but “God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted beyond what ye are able:” 4154 and so, “Thou stillest the waves thereof when they
rise.”
11. Lastly, what hast Thou done in the sea itself, to pacify its rage, and to weaken it?
“Thou hast humbled the proud4155 as one that is wounded” (ver. 10). There is a certain
proud serpent in the sea, of which another passage of Scripture speaks, “I will command
the serpent, and he shall bite him;”4156 and again, “There is that Leviathan, whom Thou
hast made to mock him,”4157 whose head He bruises above the water. “Thou,” he says, “hast
humbled the proud, as one that is wounded.” Thou hast humbled Thyself, and the proud
was humbled: for the proud held the proud ones through pride: but the great One is humbled,
and by believing in Him become small. While the little one is nourished by the example of
One who from greatness descended to humility, the devil has lost what he held: because the
proud held only the proud. When such an example of humility was displayed before them,
men learned to condemn their own pride, and to imitate the humility of God. Thus also the
devil, by losing those whom he had in his power, has even himself been humbled; not
chastened, but thrown prostrate. “Thou hast humbled the proud like one that is wounded.”
Thou hast been humbled, and hast humbled others: Thou hast been wounded, and hast

wounded others: for Thy blood, as it was shed to blot the handwriting of sins, 4158 could
not but wound him. For what was the ground of his pride, except the bond which he held
against us. This bond, this handwriting, Thou hast blotted out with Thy blood: him therefore
hast Thou wounded, from whom Thou hast rescued so many victims. You must understand
the devil wounded, not by the piercing of the flesh, which he has not, but by the bruising of
his proud heart. “Thou hast scattered Thine enemies abroad with Thy mighty arm.”
12. “The heavens are thine, the earth also is Thine” (ver. 11). From Thee, over Thy earth
they rain. Thine are the heavens, by whom is preached Thy truth in circuit of Thee; “Thine
is the earth,” which has received Thy truth in circuit of Thee; and what has resulted from
that rain? “Thou hast laid the foundation of the round world, and all that therein is.” “Thou
hast created the north and the seas” (ver. 12). For nothing has any power against Thee,
against its Creator. The world indeed may rage through its own malice, and the perversity
of its will; does it nevertheless pass over the bound laid down by the Creator, who made all
things? Why then do I fear the north wind? Why do I fear the seas? In the north indeed is
the devil, who said, “I will sit in the sides of the north; I will be like the Most High;”4159 but
Thou hast humbled, as one wounded, the proud one. Thus what Thou hast done in them
has more force for Thy dominion, than their own will has for their wickedness. “Thou hast
created the north and the seas.”
13. “Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name.” Those mountains are here under-
stood, but they have a meaning. “Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name.” Thabor,
when interpreted, signifies an approaching light. But whence comes the light of which it is
said, “Ye are the light of the world,”4160 unless from Him concerning whom it is written,
“That was the true light, which lighteth every man coming into the world”?4161 The light
then which is the light of the world comes from that light which is not kindled from any
other source, so that there is no fear lest it be extinguished. The light then comes from Him,
who is that candle which is not set beneath the bushel, but on a candlestick, Thabor the
coming light. Hermon means his curse. Justly the light comes and is made the curse of him.
Of whom but the devil, the wounded one, the proud one? Our illumination then is given
from Thee; that he is held accursed of us, who kept us in his own error and pride, is from
Thee. “Thabor and Hermon, therefore, shall rejoice,” not in their own merits, “but in Thy
name.” For they shall say, “Not unto us, Lord, not unto us, but to Thy name give the praise,”
on account of the raging sea: lest “the heathen say, Where is now their God?”4162

Psalm LXXXIX
14. “Thou hast a mighty arm” (ver. 13). Let no man arrogate anything to himself. “Thou
hast a mighty arm:” by Thee we were created, by Thee we have been defended. “Thou hast
a mighty arm: strong be Thy hand, and high be Thy right hand.”
15. “Righteousness and judgment are the preparation of Thy seat” (ver. 14). Thy right-
eousness and judgment will appear in the end: they are now hidden. Of Thy righteousness
it is treated in another Psalm,4163 “on the hidden things of the Son.” There will then be a
manifestation of Thy righteousness and judgment: some will be set on the right, others on
the left hand:4164 and the unbelieving will tremble, when they see what now they mock at,
and believe not: the righteous will rejoice, when they shall see what they now see not, yet
believe. “Righteousness and judgment are the preparation of Thy seat:” especially in the
Day of Judgment. What then now? “mercy and truth go before Thy face.” I should fear the
preparation of Thy seat, Thy justice, and Thy coming judgment, did not mercy and truth
go before Thee: why should I at the end fear Thy righteousness, when with Thy mercy going
before Thee Thou blottest out my sins, and by showing forth Thy truth fulfillest Thy
promises? “Mercy and truth go before Thy face.” For “all the paths of the Lord are mercy
and truth.”4165
16. In all these things shall we not rejoice? or shall we contain our joy? or shall words
suffice for our gladness? or shall the tongue be able to express our rejoicing? If therefore no
words suffice, “Blessed is the people, O Lord, that knoweth glad shouting” (ver. 15). O
blessed people! dost thou conceive aright, dost thou understand, glad shouting? For except
thou understand glad shouting, thou canst not be blessed. What do I mean by understanding
glad shouting? Whether thou knowest the source of that rejoicing which is beyond words
to express. For this joy is not of thyself, since “he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”4166
Rejoice not then in thy own pride, but in God’s grace. See that that grace is such, that the
tongue fails to express its greatness, and then thou understandest glad shouting.…O Lord,
“they shall walk in the light of Thy countenance.” “They shall rejoice in Thy name all the
day” (ver. 16). That Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name: all day shall they rejoice,
if they will, in Thy name; but if they will rejoice in their own name, they shall not rejoice all
day: for they shall not continue in their joy, when they shall delight in themselves, and fall
through pride. That they may rejoice all day, therefore, “they shall rejoice in Thy name, and
in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted.” Not in their own, but in Thine: lest they have a
zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For some are noted by the Apostle, that they
have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, “being ignorant of God’s righteousness,
4163 Ps. ix. Tit.
4164 Matt. xxv. 33.
4165 Ps. xxv. 10.
4166 1 Cor. i. 31.
Psalm LXXXIX
and going about to establish their own,” and not rejoicing in Thy light, and thus “not sub-
mitting themselves unto the righteousness of God.”4167 And why? because “they have a zeal
of God, but not according to knowledge.” But the people who knoweth glad shouting (for
the former err from want of knowledge, but blessed is the people not that knoweth not, but
that knoweth glad shouting), whence ought it to shout, whence to rejoice, but in Thy name,
walking in the light of Thy countenance? And it shall deserve to be exalted, but in Thy
righteousness: let every man take away altogether his own righteousness, and be trembled:
the righteousness of God shall come, and he shall be exalted, “and in Thy righteousness
shall they be exalted.”
17. “For Thou art the glory of their strength: and in Thy good pleasure Thou shalt lift
up our horns” (ver. 17): because it has seemed good to Thee, not because we are worthy.
18. “For of the Lord is our taking up” (ver. 18). For I was moved like a heap of sand,
that I might fall; and I should have fallen, had not the Lord taken me up. “For of the Lord
is (our4168) taking up: and of the Holy One of Israel our King.” Himself is thy taking up,
Himself thy illumination: in His light thou art safe, in His light thou walkest, in His right-
eousness thou art exalted. He took thee up, He guards thy weakness: He gives thee strength
of Himself, not of thyself.
19. “Thou spakest sometime in vision unto Thy sons, and saidst” (ver. 19). Thou spakest
in thy vision. Thou didst reveal this to Thy Prophets. For this reason Thou spakest in vision,
that is, in revelation: whence Prophets were called seers. They saw something within, which
they were to speak without: and secretly they heard what they preached openly.4169 Then
“Thou spakest in vision unto Thy sons, and saidst, I have laid help upon One that is mighty.”
Ye understand Who is meant by mighty? “I have exalted One chosen out of the people.”
And Who is meant by chosen? One who, ye rejoice, is already exalted.
20. “I have found David My servant:” that David from David’s seed: “with My holy oil
have I anointed Him” (ver. 20): for it is said of Him, “God, even Thy God, hath anointed
Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.”4170
21. “My hand shall hold Him fast, and My arm shall strengthen Him” (ver. 21): because
there was a taking up of man; because flesh was assumed in the Virgin’s womb,4171 because
by Him who in the form of God is coequal with the Father, the form of a servant was taken,
and He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.4172

Psalm LXXXIX
22. “The enemy shall not be able to do him violence” (ver. 22). The enemy rages indeed
but he shall not be able to do Him violence: he is wont to hurt, but he shall not hurt. How
then shall he afflict Him? he will exercise Him, but he shall not hurt Him. There shall be
profit in his raging; for those against whom he rages shall be crowned in their conquering.
For how is he conquered, if he rages not against us? or where is God our helper, if we fight
not? The enemy therefore shall do what is in his power; but “he shall not be able to do Him
violence: the son of wickedness shall not come nigh to hurt Him.”
23. “I will cut in pieces His enemies before His face” (ver. 23). They are cut in pieces
from their conspiracy, and in that they believe they are cut in pieces; for they believe by de-
grees; as when the calf’s head was ground small, they will come to be the drink of God’s
people. For Moses ground down the calf’s head, and sprinkled it upon the water, and made
the children of Israel drink it.4173 All the unbelieving are ground: they believe by degrees;
and they are drunk by the people of God, and pass into Christ’s body. “I will cut in pieces
His foes before His face: and put to flight them that hate Him.”
24. “My truth also and My mercy is with Him” (ver. 24). All the paths of the Lord are
mercy and truth. Remember, as much as ye can, how often these two attributes are urged
upon us, that we render them back to God. For as He showed us mercy that He might blot
out our sins, and truth in fulfilling His promises; so also we, walking in His path, ought to
give back to Him mercy and truth; mercy, in pitying the wretched; truth, in not judging
unjustly. Let not truth rob you of mercy, nor mercy hinder truth: for if through mercy you
shall have judged contrary to truth, or by rigorous truth shall have forgotten mercy, you
will not be walking in the path of God, where “mercy and truth meet together.”4174 “And
in My name shall His horn be exalted.” Why should I say more? Ye are Christians, recognise
Christ.
25. “I will set His hand also in the sea” (ver. 25): that is, He shall rule over the Gentiles;
“and His right hand in the floods.” Rivers run into the sea: avaricious men roll onwards into
the bitterness of this world: yet all these kinds of men will be subject to Christ.
26. “He shall call me, Thou art My Father, and the lifter up of My salvation” (ver. 26).
“And I will make Him my first-born; higher than the kings of the earth” (ver. 27). Our
Martyrs, whose birthdays we are celebrating, shed their blood on account of these things,
which were believed though not yet seen; how much more brave ought we to be, as we see
what they believed? For they had not yet seen Christ raised on high among the kings of the
earth: as yet princes were taking counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed: what
follows in the same Psalm was not then fulfilled, “Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be
4173 Exod. xxxii. 20.
4174 Ps. lxxxv. 10.
Psalm LXXXIX
learned, ye that are judges of the earth.”4175 Now indeed Christ has been exalted among the
kings of the earth.
27. “My mercy will I keep for Him for ever: and my Testament faithful with Him” (ver.
28). On His account, the Testament is faithful: in Him the Testament is mediated: He is the
Sealer, the Mediator of the Testament, the Surety of the Testament, the Witness of the
Testament, the Heritage of the Testament, the Coheir of the Testament.
28. “His seed will I make to endure world without end” (ver. 29). Not only for this world,
but unto the world without end:4176 whither His seed, which is His heritage, the seed of
Abraham, which is Christ, will pass.4177 But if ye are Christ’s, ye are also Abraham’s seed:
and if ye are destined His heirs for ever, “He will establish His seed unto world without end:
and His throne as the days of Heaven.” The thrones of earthly kings are as the days of the
earth: different are the days of Heaven from those of earth. The days of Heaven are those
years of which it is said, “Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.”4178 The days of
the earth are soon overtaken by their successors: those which precede are shut out from us:
nor do those which succeed remain: but they come that they may go, and are almost gone
before they are come. Such are the days of earth. But the days of Heaven, which are also the
“One day” of Heaven,4179 and the never failing years, have neither beginning nor end: nor
is any day there narrowed between yesterday and to-morrow: no one there expects the future,
nor loses the past: but the days of Heaven are always present, where His throne shall be for
ever and ever.4180…
29. This is a strong pledge of the promise of God. The sons of this David are the children
of the Bridegroom; all Christians therefore are called His sons. But it is much indeed that
God promises, that if Christians, that is, “If his children forsake My law, and walk not in
My judgments” (ver. 30); “if they profane My statutes, and keep not My commandments”
(ver. 31); I will not spurn them, nor will I send them away from Me in perdition: but what
will I do? “I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges” (ver. 32). It is
not the mercy of one that calls them only; but also that chastises and scourges them. Let

4180 [Here he adds: “Let us, if you please, reserve what remains; since the Psalm is a long one, and we have
yet some farther opportunity of speaking with you in Christ’s name. Refresh your strength therefore: I do not
mean that of your mind, for in mind I see that you are incapable of fatigue; but on account of the slaves of the
soul, that your bodies may be sustained in their service, refresh yourselves for a little, and being refreshed return
to your meal.”—C.]
Psalm LXXXIX
therefore thy Father’s hand be upon thee, and if thou art a good son, repel not chastening;
for “what son is there, to whom his father giveth not chastening?”4181 Let Him chasten him,
so long as He takes not from him His mercy: let Him beat him when obstinate, as long as
He does not disinherit him. If thou hast well understood the promises of thy Father, fear
not to be scourged, but to be disinherited: “for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth: and
scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”4182 Does the sinful son spurn chastening, when
he sees the only Son without sin scourged? “I will visit their offences with the rod.” Thus
too the Apostle threatens: “What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod?”4183 Let not
pious sons say, if Thou art coming with a rod, come not at all. For it is better to be taught
with the Father’s rod, than to perish in the caresses of the robber.
30. “Nevertheless, My mercy will I not utterly take from Him” (ver. 33). From whom?
From that David to whom I gave these promises, whom “I anointed with my holy oil of
gladness above His fellows.”4184 Do you recognise Him from whom God will not utterly
take away His mercy? That no one may anxiously say, since He speaks of Christ as Him
from whom He will not take away His mercy, What then will become of the sinner? Did He
say anything like this, “I will not take My loving-kindness utterly from them”? “I will visit,”
He saith, “their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.” Thou didst expect for
thy own security, “I will not utterly take my loving-kindness from” them. And indeed this
is the reading of some books, but not of the most accurate: though, where they have it, it is
a reading by no means inconsistent with the real meaning. For how can it be said that He
will not utterly take His mercy from Christ? Has the Saviour of the body committed aught
of sin either in Heaven or in earth, “who sitteth even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us”?4185 Yet it is from Christ: but from His members, His body
which is the Church. For in this sense He speaks of it as a great thing that He will not take
away His mercies from Him, supposing us not to recognise the only Son, who is in the
bosom of the Father;4186 for there the Man is not counted for His Person, but the One Person
is God and Man. He therefore does not utterly take His mercies from Him, when He takes
not His mercy from His body, His members,4187 in which, even while He was enthroned
in Heaven, He was still suffering persecutions on earth; and when He cried from Heaven,

4187 i.e. we may consider it as not said of Him at all, for though He is Man, yet being God also He would
not, in His own Person, need assurance; therefore it is said of Him in His members.
Psalm LXXXIX
“Saul, Saul,” not why persecutest thou My servants, nor why persecutest thou My saints,
nor My disciples, but, “why persecutest thou Me?”4188 As then, while no one persecuted
Him when sitting in Heaven, He cried out, “Why persecutest thou Me?” when the Head
recognised its limbs, and His love allowed not the Head to separate Himself from the union
of the body: so, when He taketh not away His mercies from Him, it is surely that He taketh
it not from us, who are His limbs and body. Yet ought we not on that account to sin not
without apprehension, and perversely to assure ourselves that we shall not perish, be our
actions what they may. For there are certain sins and certain offences, to define and discourse
of which it is either impossible for me, or if it were possible, it would be too tedious for the
time we have at present. For no man can say that he is without sin; for if he says so, he will
lie; “if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”4189 Each
one therefore is needfully scourged for his own sins; but the mercy of God is not taken away
from him, if he be a Christian. Certainly if thou committest such offences as to repel the
hand of Him who chasteneth, the rod of Him who scourgeth thee, and art angry at the cor-
rection of God, and fliest from thy Father when He chasteneth thee, and wilt not suffer Him
to be thy Father, because He spares thee not when thou dost sin; thou hast estranged thyself
from thy heritage, He has not thrown thee off; for if thou wouldest abide being scourged,
thou wouldest not abide disinherited. “Nor will I do hurt in My truth.” For His mercy in
setting free shall not be taken away, lest His truth in taking vengeance do harm.
31. “My covenant will I not profane, nor reject the thing that is gone out of my lips”
(ver. 34). Because his sons sin, I will not on this account be found false: I have promised; I
will do. Suppose they choose to sin even as past hope, and so fall into sins as to offend their
Father’s countenance, and deserve to be disinherited; is it not still God Himself, of whom
it is said, “From these stones” He “will raise up sons to Abraham”?4190 Therefore I tell you,
brethren, many Christians sin venially,4191 many are scourged and so corrected for their
sin, chastened, and cured; many turn away altogether, striving with a stiff neck against the
discipline of the Father, even wholly refusing God as their Father, though they have the
mark of Christ, and so fall into such sins, that it can only be announced against them, “that
they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”4192 Nevertheless, Christ
shall not be destitute of an inheritance on their account: not for the chaff’s sake shall the
wheat also perish:4193 nor on account of bad fish shall nothing be cast into the vessels from

that net.4194 “The Lord knows them that are His.”4195 For He who predestined us before
we were born, promised undoubtingly: “For whom He did predestinate, them He also called:
and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also glori-
fied.”4196 Let desperate sinners sin as far as they choose: let the members of Christ reply,
“If God is with us, who shall be against us?” God will not therefore do hurt in His truth, nor
will He “profane His Testament.” His Testament remains immovable, because in His fore-
knowledge He predestined His heirs; and “He will not reject the thing that is gone out of
His lips.”
32. Listen for thy confirmation in hope, for thy security, if thou knowest thyself to be
among the members of Christ. “I have sworn once by My holiness that I will not lie unto
David” (ver. 35). Dost thou wait till God swear a second time? How often is He to swear, if
in one oath He is false? One oath He made for our life, who sent His Only One to die for
us. “I have sworn once by My holiness, that I will not lie unto David.” “His seed shall endure
for ever” (ver. 36). His seed endures for ever; because the Lord knows them that are His.
“And His seat is like as the sun before me:” “and as the moon perfect for evermore: and the
faithful witness in heaven” (ver. 37). They are His seat, in whom He sits and reigns. But if
His seat, His members also; because even our members are the seat of our head. See how
all our other members sustain our head: but the head supports nothing above itself, but is
itself supported by the rest of our limbs, as if the whole body of a man were the seat of his
head. His seat, therefore, all in whom God reigns, “shall be like as the sun before Me,” He
saith: because the righteous in the kingdom of My Father “shall shine like the sun.”4197 But
the sun is meant in a spiritual, not a bodily sense, as that which shines from Heaven, which
He maketh to rise upon the just and unjust.4198 Finally, that sun is not before men’s eyes
only, but even those of cattle and the smallest insects; for which of the vilest animals sees
not that sun? What does he say to distinguish the sun meant here? “Like as the sun before
Me.” Not before men, before the flesh, before mortal animals, but “before Me, and as the
moon.” But what moon? one “that is perfect for evermore.” For although that moon which
we know becomes perfect, the next day she begins to wane, after her orb is full. “He shall
be as the moon perfect for evermore,” He saith. His seat shall be made perfect as the moon,
but that moon is one which will be perfect for evermore. If as the sun, why also as the moon?
the Scriptures usually signify by the moon the mortality of this flesh, because of its increasings
and decreasings, because of its transitory nature. The moon is also interpreted as Jericho:
4194 Matt. xiii. 47.
4195 2 Tim. ii. 19.
4196 Rom. viii. 29, 30.
4197 Matt. xiii. 43.
4198 Matt. v. 45.
Psalm LXXXIX
one who was descending from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among robbers: 4199 for he was
descending from immortality to mortality. Similar then is the flesh to that moon, which
every month suffers increase and decrease: but that flesh of ours will be perfect in the resur-
rection: “and a faithful witness in heaven.” Thus then, if it was our mind only that would
be perfected, he would compare us only to the sun: if our body only, to the moon; but as
God will perfect us in both, in respect of the mind it is said, “like as the sun before Me,”
because God only seeth the mind: and “as the moon,” so is the flesh: which “shall be made
perfect for evermore,” in the resurrection of the dead: “and a faithful witness in Heaven,”
because all that was asserted of the resurrection of the dead was true. I beseech you, hear
this again more clearly, and remember it: for I know that some understand, while others
are yet enquiring perhaps what I meant. There is no article of the Christian faith which has
encountered such contradiction as that of the resurrection of the flesh. Finally, He who was
born for a sign that should be spoken against,4200 resumed His own flesh after death to meet
the caviller; and He who could have so completely cured His wounds that their scars would
have entirely vanished, retained those scars in His body, that He might cure the wounds of
doubt in the heart. Indeed nothing has been attacked with the same pertinacious, contentious
contradiction, in the Christian faith, as the resurrection of the flesh. On the immortality of
the soul many Gentile philosophers have disputed at great length, and in many books they
have left it written that the soul is immortal: when they come to the resurrection of the flesh,
they doubt not indeed, but they most openly deny it, declaring it to be absolutely impossible
that this earthly flesh can ascend to Heaven. Thus that moon shall be perfect for evermore,
and shall be the faithful witness in heaven against all gain-sayers.
33. These promises, so sure, so firm, so open, so unquestioned, were made concerning
Christ. For although some are mysteriously veiled, yet some are so clear, that all that is ob-
scure is easily revealed by them. Such being the case, see what follows: “But Thou hast ap-
proved and brought to nothing and forsaken Thine Anointed” (ver. 38). “Thou hast over-
thrown the testament of Thy servant, and profaned His holiness on the ground” (ver. 39).
“Thou hast broken down all His hedges, and made His strongholds a terror” (ver. 40).…How
is this? Thou hast promised all those things: and Thou hast brought to pass their reverse.
Where are now the promises which but a little before filled us with delight? which we so
joyfully applauded, which we so fearlessly made our boast of? It is as if one promised, and
another destroyed. And this is the mystery: for the words are not “another,” but “Thou,”
Thou who didst promise, who didst even swear in condescension to human doubt, Thou
hast promised this, and done thus! Whence shall I get Thy oath, where shall I find Thy
promise fulfilled? Would then God promise, or swear thus falsely? and yet why then these
4199 Luke x. 30.
4200 Luke ii. 34. [A.N.F. vol. iii. p. 525.—C.]
Psalm LXXXIX
promises, and these acts? I answer, that He acted thus in fulfilment of those promises. But
who am I, to say this? Let us see therefore whether it is the language of the Truth; what I say
will not then be without foundation. It was David to whom the fulfilment of these promises
in his seed, that is, in Christ, was promised: and as they were addressed to David, men ex-
pected their completion in David. Further, lest when any Christian asserted these promises
to have referred to Christ, another by applying them to David, because he described the
fulfilment of all of them in David, might thus err; He cancelled them in David, thus obliging
us when we see them unfulfilled in David, to look to another quarter for their fulfilment.
Thus also in the case of Esau and Jacob, we find the elder worshipped by the younger, though
it is written, “The elder shall serve the younger;”4201 so when you see it unfulfilled in those
two brothers, you look for two peoples in whom to discover the completion of what God
in His truth deigns to promise. “From the fruit of thy body,” saith the Lord unto David,
“shall I set upon thy sea.”4202 He promised from his seed something for evermore: and,
Solomon, born to him, became master of such wisdom,4203 that the promise of God respect-
ing the fruit of David’s body was believed to have been fulfilled in him; but Solomon fell,4204
and gave room for hoping for Christ; that since God can neither be deceived nor deceive,
He might not make His promise to rest in one who He knew would fall, but you might after
the fall of Solomon look back to God, and demand His promise. Hast Thou, O Lord, deceived?
Hast Thou failed to fulfil Thy promise? Dost Thou not exhibit what Thou hast sworn? Per-
haps God might reply, I swore and promised: but Solomon would not persevere. What then?
Didst not Thou, Lord God, know beforehand that he would not persevere? Indeed Thou
didst know. Why then didst Thou promise me what should be eternal in one who would
not persevere? Hast Thou not answered; “But if his children forsake My law, and walk not
in My judgments; if they keep not My statutes, and profane My testament;” yet My promise
shall remain, and My oath shall be fulfilled: “I have sworn once in My Holiness,” within, in
a certain mystery, in the very spring whence the Prophets drank, whence they burst forth
to us of these things, “I have sworn once” that I will not fail David. Show forth then what
Thou hast sworn, give us what Thou hast promised. The fulfilment is taken from that David,
that it might not be looked for in that David: wait therefore for what I have promised.
34. Even David himself knew this. Consider his words; “Thou hast rejected and brought
him down to nothing.” Where then is Thy promise? “Thou hast put off Thine anointed.”
This expression cheers us, among much that is sorrowful: for the promise of God is still
valid; for4205 Thou hast put off Thine Anointed, not taken Him away. See then what was

Psalm LXXXIX
the fate of that David, in whom the ignorant hoped for the fulfilment of the promises of
God, in order that those promises might be more firmly relied upon for their fulfilment in
another. “Thou hast put off Thine Anointed: Thou hast overthrown the testament of Thy
servant.” For where is the Old Testament of the Jews? where that land of promise, in which
they sinned while they dwelt in it, on the overthrow of which they wandered afar? Ask you
for the kingdom of the Jews; it exists not: you ask for the altar of the Jews; it is not: you ask
for the sacrifice of the Jews; it is not: you ask for the priesthood of the Jews; it is not. “Thou
hast overthrown the testament of Thy servant, and profaned his holiness on the earth.”
Thou hast shown that what they thought holy, was earthly. “Thou hast broken down all his
hedges,” with which Thou hast entrenched him: for how could he have been spoiled unless
his hedges had been broken down? “Thou hast made his strongholds a terror.” Why terror?
That it should be said to the sinners, “For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed
lest He also spare not thee.”4206
“All they that go by the way have spoiled him:” that is, all the heathen that go by the
way, meaning, all who pass through this life, have spoiled Israel, have spoiled David. First
of all, see his fragments in all nations: for it is of the Jews that it is said, “They shall be a
portion for foxes.”4207 For the Scripture calls wicked, crafty, and cowardly kings, whom
another’s virtue terrifies, foxes. Thus when our Lord Himself was speaking of the threatening
Herod, He said, “Go ye, and tell that fox.”4208 The king who fears no man, is not a fox: like
that Lion of Judah, of whom it is said, “Stooping down Thou didst rise up, and didst sleep
as a lion.”4209 At Thy will Thou didst stoop down, at Thy will didst rise; because Thou
wouldest, Thou didst sleep. And thus in another Psalm he says, “I4210 slept.”4211 Was not
the sentence complete, “I slept, and took rest, and rose up again, because the Lord shall
uphold Me”? Why is the word ego added? and thus with a strong emphasis on the word I,
they raged against Me, they troubled Me: but had I not willed, I had not slept. Those then
concerning whom it was declared that they should be a portion for foxes, are now spoken
of as follows; “All they that go by have spoiled him: and he is become a reproach to his
neighbours” (ver. 41). “Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, and made all his
adversaries to rejoice” (ver. 42). Look at the Jews, and see all things fulfilled that were pre-
dicted. “Thou hast turned away the help of his sword.” How they were used to fight few in
number, and to strike down many. “Thou hast turned away the help of his sword, and Thou

givest him not victory in the battle” (ver. 43). Naturally4212 then is he conquered, naturally
taken prisoner, naturally made an outcast from his kingdom, naturally scattered abroad:
for he lost that land, for which he slew the Lord. “Thou hast loosed him from cleansing”
(ver. 44). What is this? Amongst all the evils, this is a matter for great fear; for howsoever
God may beat, howsoever He may be wroth, howsoever He may flog and scourge, yet let
Him scourge him bound, whom He is to cleanse, not “loose him from cleansing.” For if He
loose him from being purified, he becomes incapable of cleansing, and must be an outcast.
From what cleansing then is the Jew loosed? From faith; for by faith we live: 4213 and it is
said of faith, “purifying their hearts by faith:”4214 and as it is only the faith of Christ that
cleanses; by disbelief in Christ, they are loosed from purification. “Thou hast loosed him
from cleansing, and cast his throne down to the ground.” And so Thou hast broken it. “The
days of his seat hast Thou shortened” (ver. 45). They imagined that they should reign for
ever. “And covered him with confusion.” All these things happened to the Jews, Christ yet
not being taken away, but His advent deferred.
35. Let us therefore see whether God fulfils His promises. After these stern penalties
which have been recorded as having been inflicted upon this people and kingdom, that God
might not be supposed to have fulfilled His promises in it, and so not to grant another
kingdom in Christ, of which kingdom there shall be no end; the Prophet addresses Him in
these words, “Lord, how long wilt Thou hide Thyself unto the end?” (ver. 46). For possibly
it was not from them and to the end; because “blindness in part is happened to Israel, until
the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel shall be saved.”4215 But in the mean
while “shall Thy wrath burn like fire.”
36. “O remember what my substance is” (ver. 47). That David, who was placed among
the Jews in the flesh, in Christ in hope, speaks “Remember what is my substance.” For not
because the Jews fell away, did my substance fail: for from that people came the Virgin Mary,
and from her the flesh of Christ; that Flesh sins not, but purifies sins; there, saith David, is
my substance. “O remember what my substance is.” For the root has not entirely perished;
the seed shall come to whom the promise was made, ordained by Angels in the hand of a
Mediator.4216 “For Thou hast not made all the sons of men for nought” (ver. 47). Lo! all the
sons of men have gone into vanity: yet Thou hast not made them for nought. If then all went
into vanity, whom Thou hast not made for nought; hast Thou not reserved some instrument
to purify them from vanity? This which Thou hast reserved to Thyself to cleanse men from
4212 Merito.
4213 Gal. iii. 11.
4214 Acts xv. 9.

Psalm LXXXIX
vanity is Thy Holy One, in Him is my substance: for from Him are all, whom Thou hast not
made for nought, purified from their own vanity. To them it is said, “O ye sons of men, how
long are ye heavy in heart? Wherefore have ye such pleasure in vanity, and seek after leas-
ing?”4217 Perhaps they might become anxious, and turn from their vanity, and when they
found themselves polluted with it, might seek for purification from it: then help them, make
them secure. “Know this also, that the Lord hath made wonderful His Holy One.”4218 He
has made His Holy One to be admired: thence He has purified all from their vanity: there,
saith David, is my substance: O remember it! “For Thou hast not made all the sons of men
for nought.” Thou hast therefore reserved something to purify them: and who is He whom
Thou hast reserved? “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?” This man then
who shall live and not see death, shall purify them from nothingness. For He made not all
men for nought, nor can He who made them so despise His own creatures, as not to convert
and purify them.
37. “What man is he that shall live, and shall not see death?” (ver. 48). For being raised
from the dead He dieth no more, and death hath no more dominion over Him.4219 And as
in another Psalm it is said, “Thou shalt not leave my soul in Hell, neither shalt Thou suffer
Thy Holy One to see corruption,”4220 the Apostolic teaching takes up this testimony, and
in the Acts of the Apostles4221 thus argues against the unbelieving; Men and brethren, we
know that the patriarch David is dead and buried, and his flesh hath seen corruption.
Therefore it cannot be said of him, “neither shalt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see corrup-
tion.” Of whom then is it said? “What man is he that shall live, and shall not see death?”
Perhaps there is no man such. Nay, but “who is it?” is said to make thee inquire, not despair.
But perhaps there may be some man “that shall live, and shall not see death,” and yet perhaps
he did not speak of Christ, who died? There is no man “that shall live, and shall not see
death,” except Him who died for mortals. That thou mayest be assured that it is said of Him,
consider the sequel; “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?” Did He never die
then? He did. How then shall He live, and never see death? “He shall deliver His own soul
from the hands of Hell.” He is spoken of alone indeed, in that He alone of all others “shall
live, and shall not see death: He shall deliver His own soul from the hand of Hell,” because
although the rest of His faithful shall rise from the dead, and shall themselves live for ever-
more, without seeing death; yet they shall not themselves deliver their own souls from the
hands of Hell. He who delivers His own soul from the hands of Hell, Himself delivers those

of His believers: they cannot do so of themselves. Prove that He delivers His own soul. “I
have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again. No man taketh ‘it from
Me;’ for I Myself slept, but I lay it down of Myself, and take it again,”4222 because it is He
Himself who delivers His own soul from the hands of Hell.
38. But in the very faith in Christ great difficulties occurred, and the heathen in their
rage long said, “When shall he die, and his name perish?” On account of these then who
have now long believed in Christ, but were destined to doubt for some time, these words
follow, “Lord, where are Thy old loving-kindnesses?” (ver. 49). We have now acknowledged
Christ our purifier, we now possess Him in whom Thy promises were to be fulfilled; show
forth in Him what Thou hast promised. It is He Himself that shall live, and not see death:
Himself who delivers His own soul from the hand of Hell: and yet we are still in suffering.
Thus spoke the Martyrs, whose birthdays we are celebrating. He shall live, and not see death:
He delivers His soul from the hands of Hell: yet “for Thy sake we are killed all the day long:
and are counted as sheep appointed to be slain.”4223 “Lord, where are Thy old loving-
kindnesses which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth?”
39. “Remember, Lord, the rebuke that Thy servants have” (ver. 50). Even while Christ
was living, and while He was sitting on His Father’s right hand, reproaches were cast against
the Christians: they long were reproached with the name of Christ. That widowed one who
brought forth, and whose children were more than those of the married wife,4224 heard ill
names, heard reproaches: but the Church, multiplied as she is, extending right and left, no
longer remembers the reproach of her widowhood. “Remember, Lord,” in the memory of
whom there is abundant sweetness. “Remember,” forget not. Remember what? “the rebuke
that Thy servants have: and how I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people.” I
went, saith he, to preach of Thee, and I heard reproaches, and bore them in my bosom, be-
cause I was fulfilling the prophecy. “Being defamed we entreat: we are made as the filth of
the earth, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.”4225 Long the Christians bore
reproaches in their bosom, in their heart: nor dared resist their revilers; before, when it was
a crime to answer a heathen: it is now a crime to remain a heathen. Thanks be to the Lord!
He remembered our rebukes: He raised the horn of His Anointed on high, He made Him
the Wonderful among the kings of the earth. Now no one insults Christians, or if he does,
it is not in public: he speaks as if he were still more fearful of being heard, than anxious to
be believed. “I bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people.”

Psalm LXXXIX
40. “Wherewith Thine enemies have blasphemed Thee, O Lord” (ver. 51), both Jews
and Pagans. “Wherewith they have blasphemed.” Wherewith have they blasphemed Thee?
“With the change of Thine Anointed.”4226 They objected that Christ died, and was crucified.
Madmen, what is your reproach? Although there is now no one to use it: yet supposing
some still remaining that so speak, what is your reproach? that Christ died? He was not
destroyed, but changed. He is styled “dead” on account of the three days. Wherewith then
have thine enemies blasphemed Thee? Not with the loss, not with the perdition of Thine
Anointed, but with His “change.” He was changed from temporal to eternal life: He was
changed from the Jews to the Gentiles; He was changed from earth to heaven. Let then Thy
vain enemies blaspheme Thee still for the change of Thine Anointed. Would that they may
be changed: they will not in that case blaspheme the change of Christ, which displeases them
since they themselves will not be changed. “For there is no change with them, and they fear
not God.”4227
41. They have blasphemed the change of Christ; but what dost thou answer? “The
blessing of4228 the Lord for evermore. Amen and Amen” (ver. 52). Thanks to His mercy,4229
thanks to His grace. We express our thanks: we do not give them, nor return them, nor repay
them: we express our thanks in words, while in fact we retain our sense of them.4230 He
saved us for no reward, He heeded not our impieties: He searched us out when we searched
not for Him, He found, redeemed, emancipated us from the bondage of the devil and the
power of his wicked angels: He drew us to Him to purify us by that faith, from which He
releases those enemies only who believe not, and who for that reason cannot be purified.
Let those who still remain infidels say every day what they choose; day by day they shall be
fewer and fewer that remain; let them revile, mock, accuse, not the death, but the change of
Christ. Do they not see that, when they say these things, they fail in purpose either by believ-
ing or by dying? For their curse is temporal: but the blessing of the Lord “for evermore.” To
confirm that blessing is added, “Amen and Amen.” This is the signature of the bond of God.
Secure then of His promises, let us believe the past, recognise the present, hope for the future.
Let not the enemy lead us astray from the way, that He, who gathers us like chickens under
His wings, may foster us: lest we stray from His wings, and the hawk of the air carry us off
while yet unfledged. For the Christian ought not to hope in himself: if he hopes to be strong,
let him be reared by his mother’s warmth. This is the hen who gathers her young together;
whence is the reproach of our Saviour against the unbelieving Jerusalem. “Behold, your
4226 Christi.

house shall be left unto you desolate.” 4231 Hence was it said, “Thou hast made his strongholds
a terror.” Since then they would not be gathered together under the wings of this hen, and
have given as a warning to teach us to dread the unclean spirits that fly in the air, seeking
daily what they may devour; let us gather ourselves under the wings of this hen, the divine
Wisdom, since she is weakened even unto death of her chickens. Let us love our Lord God,
let us love His Church: Him as a Father, Her as a Mother: Him as a Lord, Her as His
Handmaid, as we are ourselves the Handmaid’s sons. But this marriage is held together by
a bond of great love: no man offends the one, and wins favour of the other. Let no man say,
“I go indeed to the idols, I consult possessed ones and fortune-tellers: yet I abandon not
God’s Church; I am a Catholic.” While thou holdest to thy Mother, thou hast offended thy
Father. Another says, Far be it from me; I consult no sorcerer, I seek out no possessed one,
I never ask advice by sacrilegious divination, I go not to worship idols, I bow not before
stones; though I am in the party of Donatus. What does it profit you not to have offended
your Father, if he avenges your offended Mother? what does it serve you, if you acknowledge
the Lord, honour God, preach His name, acknowledge His Son, confess that He sitteth by
His right hand; while you blaspheme His Church? Does not the analogy of human marriages
convince you? Suppose you have some patron, whom you court every day, whose threshold
you wear with your visits, whom you daily not only salute, but even worship, to whom you
pay the most loyal courtesy; if you utter one calumny against his wife, could you re-enter
his house? Hold then, most beloved, hold all with one mind to God the Father, and the
Church our Mother. Celebrate with temperance the birthdays of the Saints, that we may
imitate those who have gone before us, and that they who pray for you may rejoice over
you; that “the blessing of the Lord may abide on you for evermore. Amen and Amen.”
4231 Matt. xxiii. 38.
Psalm LXXXIX
Psalm XC.4232
1. This Psalm is entitled, “The prayer of Moses the man of God,” through whom, His
man, God gave the law to His people, through whom He freed them from the house of
slavery, and led them forty years through the wilderness. Moses was therefore the Minister
of the Old, and the Prophet of the New Testament. For “all these things,” saith the Apostle,
“happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, unto whom
the ends of the world come.” 4233 In accordance therefore with this dispensation which was
vouchsafed to Moses, this Psalm is to be examined, as it has received its title from his prayer.
2. “Lord,” he saith, “Thou hast been our refuge from one generation to another” (ver.
1): either in every generation, or in two generations, the old and new: because, as I said, he
was the Minister of the Testament that related to the old generation, and the Prophet of the
Testament which appertained to the new. Jesus Himself, the Surety of that covenant, and
the Bridegroom in the marriage which He entered into in that generation, saith, “Had ye
believed Moses, ye would have believed Me: for he wrote of Me.”4234 Now it is not to be
believed that this Psalm was entirely the composition of that Moses, as it is not distinguished
by any of those of his expressions4235 which are used in his songs: but the name of the great
servant of God is used for the sake of some intimation, which should direct the attention of
the reader or listener. “Lord,” he saith, “Thou hast been our refuge from one generation to
the other.”
3. He adds, how He became our refuge, since He began to be that, viz. a refuge, to us
which He had not been before, not that He had not existed before He became our refuge:
“Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made: and
from age even unto age Thou art” (ver. 2). Thou therefore who art for ever, and before we
were, and before the world was, hast become our refuge ever since we turned to Thee. But
the expression, “before the mountains,” etc., seems to me to contain a particular meaning;
for mountains are the higher parts of the earth, and if God was before even the earth were
formed (or, as some books have it, from the same Greek word, “framed”4236), since it was
by Him that it was formed, what is the need of saying that He was before the mountains, or
any certain parts of it, since God was not only before the earth, but before heaven and earth,
and even the whole bodily and spiritual creation? But it may certainly be that the whole ra-
tional creation is marked by this distinction; that while the loftiness of Angels is signified
by the mountains, the lowliness of man is meant by the earth. And for this reason, although

Psalm XC
all the works of creation are not improperly said to be either made or formed; nevertheless,
if there is any propriety in these words, the Angels are “made;” for as they are enumerated
among His heavenly works, the enumeration itself is thus concluded: “He spake the word,
and they were made; He commanded, and they were created;”4237 but the earth was “formed,”
that man might thence be created in the body. For the Scripture uses this word, where we
read, God made, or “God formed man out of the dust of the ground.”4238 Before then the
noblest parts of the creation (for what is higher than the rational part of the Heavenly cre-
ation) were made: before the earth was made, that Thou mightest have worshippers upon
the earth; and even this is little, as all these had a beginning either in or with time; but “from
age to age Thou art.” It would have been better, from everlasting to everlasting: for God,
who is before the ages, exists not from a certain age, nor to a certain age, which has an end,
since He is without end. But it often happens in the Scripture, that the equivocal Greek word
causes the Latin translator to put age for eternity and eternity for age. But he very rightly
does not say, Thou wast from ages, and unto ages Thou shalt be: but puts the verb in the
present, intimating that the substance of God is altogether immutable. It is not, He was, and
Shall be, but only Is. Whence the expression, I Am that I Am; and, I Am “hath sent me unto
you;”4239 and, “Thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed: but Thou art the same,
and Thy years shall not fail.”4240 Behold then the eternity that is our refuge, that we may
fly thither from the mutability of time, there to remain for evermore.
4. But as our life here is exposed to numerous and great temptations, and it is to be
feared lest we may be turned aside by them from that refuge, let us see what in consequence
of this the prayer of the man of God seeks for. “Turn not Thou man to lowness” (ver. 3):
that is, let not man, turned aside from Thy eternal and sublime things, lust for things of
time, savour of earthly things. This prayer is what God has Himself enjoined us, in the
Prayer, “Lead us not into temptation,”4241 He adds, “Again Thou sayest, Come again, ye
children of men.” As if he said, I ask of Thee what Thou hast commanded me to ask: giving
glory to His grace, that “he that glorieth, in the Lord he may glory:”4242 without whose help
we cannot by an exertion of our own will overcome the temptations of this life. “Turn not
Thou man to lowness: again thou sayest, Turn again, ye children of men.” But grant what
Thou has enjoined, by hearing the prayer4243 of him who can at least pray, and aiding the
faith of the willing soul.

Psalm XC
5. “For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday, which is past by” (ver. 4):
hence we ought to turn to Thy refuge, where Thou art without any change, from the fleeting
scenes around us; since however long a time may be wished for for this life, “a thousand
years in Thy sight are but as yesterday:” not as to-morrow, which is to come: for all limited
periods of time are reckoned as having already passed. Hence the Apostle’s choice is rather
to aim at what is before,4244 that is, to desire things eternal, and to forget things behind, by
which temporal matters should be understood. But that no one may imagine a thousand
years are reckoned by God as one day, as if with God days were so long, when this is only
said in contempt of the extent of time: he adds, “and as a watch in the night:” which only
lasts three hours. Nevertheless men have ventured to assert their knowledge of times, to the
pretenders to which our Lord said, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons, which
the Father hath put in His own power:”4245 and they allege that this period may be defined
six thousand years, as of six days. Nor have they heeded the words, “are but as one day which
is past by:” for, when this was uttered, not a thousand years only had passed, and the expres-
sion, “as a watch in the night,” ought to have warned them that they might not be deceived
by the uncertainty of the seasons: for even if the six first days in which God finished His
works seemed to give some plausibility to their opinion, six watches, which amount to
eighteen hours, will not consist with that opinion.
6. Next, the man of God, or rather the Prophetic spirit, seems to be reciting some law
written in the secret wisdom of God, in which He has fixed a limit to the sinful life of mortals,
and determined the troubles of mortality, in the following words: “Their years are as things
which are nothing worth: in the morning let it fade away like the grass” (ver. 5). The happi-
ness therefore of the heirs of the old covenant, which they asked of the Lord their God as a
great boon, attained to receive this Law in His mysterious Providence. Moses seems to be
reciting it: “Their years shall be things which are esteemed as nothing.” Such are those things
which are not before they are come: and when come, shall soon not be: for they do not come
to be here, but to be gone. “In the morning,” that is, before they come, “as a heat4246 let it
pass by;” but “in the evening,” it means after they come, “let it fall, and be dried up, and
withered” (ver. 6). It is “to fall” in death, be “dried up” in the corpse, “withered” in the dust.
What is this but flesh, wherein is the accursed lust of fleshly things? “For all flesh is grass,
and all the goodliness of man as the flower of the field; the grass withereth, the flower fadeth:
but the word of the Lord abideth for ever.”4247

7. Making no secret that this fate is a penalty inflicted for sin, he adds at once, “For we
consume away in Thy displeasure, and are troubled at Thy wrathful indignation” (ver. 7):
we consume away in our weakness, and are troubled from the fear of death; for we are become
weak, and yet fearful to end that weakness. “Another,” saith He, “shall gird thee, and carry
thee whither thou wouldest not:” 4248 although not to be punished, but to be crowned, by
martyrdom; and the soul of our Lord, transforming us into Himself, was sorrowful even
unto death: for “the Lord’s going out” is no other than in “death.”
8. “Thou hast set our misdeeds before Thee” (ver. 8): that is, Thou hast not dissembled
Thine anger: “and our age in the light of Thy countenance.” “The light of Thy countenance”
answers to “before Thee,” and to “our misdeeds,” as above.
9. “For all our days are failed, and in Thine anger we have failed” (ver. 9). These words
sufficiently prove that our subjection to death is a punishment. He speaks of our days failing,
either because men fail in them from loving things that pass away, or because they are reduced
to so small a number; which he asserts in the following lines: “our years are spent in thought
like a spider.” 4249 “The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be
so strong that they come to fourscore years, yet is more of them but labour and sorrow”
(ver. 10). These words appear to express the shortness and misery of this life: since those
who have reached their seventieth year are styled old men. Up to eighty, however, they appear
to have some strength; but if they live beyond this, their existence is laborious through
multiplied sorrows. Yet many even below the age of seventy experience an old age the most
infirm and wretched: and old men have often been found to be wonderfully vigorous even
beyond eighty years. It is therefore better to search for some spiritual meaning in these
numbers. For the anger of God is not greater on the sins of Adam (through whom alone
“sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men”),4250 because
they live a much shorter time than the men of old; since even the length of their days is ri-
diculed in the comparison of a thousand years to yesterday that is past, and to three hours:
especially since at the very time when they provoked the anger of God to send the deluge
in which they perished, their life was at its longest span.
10. Moreover, seventy and eighty years equal a hundred and fifty; a number which the
Psalms clearly insinuate to be a sacred one. One hundred and fifty have the same relative
signification as fifteen, the latter number being composed of seven and eight together: the
first of which points to the Old Testament through the observation of the Sabbath; the latter
to the New, referring to the resurrection of our Lord. Hence the fifteen steps in the Temple.
Hence in the Psalms, fifteen “songs of degrees.” Hence the waters of the deluge overtopped
4248 John xxi. 18.
4249 Sicut aranea meditabantur.
4250 Rom. v. 12.
Psalm XC
the highest mountains by fifteen cubits:4251 and many other instances of the same nature.
“Our years are passed in thought like a spider.” We were labouring in things corruptible,
corruptible works were we weaving together: which, as the Prophet Isaiah saith, by no means
covered us.4252 “The days of our years are in themselves,” etc. A distinction is here made
between themselves and their strength:4253 “in themselves,” that is, in the years or days
themselves, may mean in temporal things, which are promised in the Old Testament, signified
by the number seventy; “but if” not in themselves, but “in their strength,” refers not to
temporal things, but to things eternal, “fourscore years,” as the New Testament contains
the hope of a new life and resurrection for evermore: and what is added, that if they pass
this latter period,4254 “their strength is labour and sorrow,” intimates that such shall be the
fate of him who goes beyond this faith, and seeks for more. It may also be understood thus:
because although we are established in the New Testament, which the number eighty signifies,
yet still our life is one of labour and sorrow, while “we groan within ourselves, awaiting the
adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body; for we are saved by hope; and if we hope for
that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.”4255 This relates to the mercy of God,
of which he proceeds to say, “Since thy mercy cometh over us,4256 and we shall be chastened:”
for “the Lord chasteneth whom He loveth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth,”4257
and to some mighty ones He giveth a thorn in the flesh, to buffet them, that they may not
be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, so that strength be
made perfect in weakness.4258 Some copies read, we shall be “taught,” instead of “chastened,”
which is equally expressive of the Divine Mercy; for no man can be taught without labour
and sorrow; since strength is made perfect in weakness.
11. “For who knoweth the power of Thy wrath: and for the fear of Thee to number Thine
anger?” (ver. 11). It belongs to very few men, he saith, to know the power of Thy wrath; for
when Thou dost spare, Thy anger is so far heavier against most men; that we may know
that labour and sorrow belong not to wrath, but rather to Thy mercy, when Thou chastenest
and teachest those whom Thou lovest, to save them from the torments of eternal punishment:
4251 Gen. vii. 20.
4252 Isa. lix. 6.
4253 Aliud est in ipsis, aliud in potentatibus.
4254 St. Augustin seems to refer the word amplius to a period beyond the eighty years. In the English version
it clearly applies to the attainment of that age.

4258 2 Cor. xii. 7, 9.
Psalm XC
as it is said in another Psalm,4259 “The sinner hath provoked the Lord: He will not require
it of him according to the greatness of His wrath.” With this also is understood, “Who
knoweth?” Such is the difficulty of finding any one who knoweth how to number Thine
anger by Thy fear, that he adds this, meaning that it is to the purpose that Thou appearest
to spare some, with whom Thou art more angry, that the sinner may be prospered in his
path, and receive a heavier doom at the last. For when the power of human wrath hath killed
the body, it hath nothing more to do: but God hath power both to punish here, and after
the death of the body to send into Hell, and by the few who are thus taught, the vain and
seductive prosperity of the wicked is judged to be greater wrath of God.4260…
12. “Make Thy right hand so well known” (ver. 12). This is the reading of most of the
Greek copies: not of some in Latin, which is thus, “Make Thy right hand well known to me.”
What is, “Thy right hand,” but Thy Christ, of whom it is said, And to whom is the Arm of
the Lord revealed?4261 Make Him so well known, that Thy faithful may learn in Him to ask
and to hope for those things rather of Thee as rewards of their faith, which do not appear
in the Old Testament, but are revealed in the New: that they may not imagine that the hap-
piness derived from earthly and temporal blessings is to be highly esteemed, desired, or
loved, and thus their feet slip,4262 when they see it in men who honour Thee not: that their
steps may not give way, while they know not how to number Thine anger. Finally, in accord-
ance with this prayer of the Man that is His,4263 He has made His Christ so well known as
to show by His sufferings that not these rewards which seem so highly prized in the Old
Testament, where they are shadows of things to come, but things eternal, are to be desired.
The right hand of God may also be understood in this sense, as that by which He will separate
His saints from the wicked: because that hand becomes well known, when it scourgeth every
son whom He receiveth, and suffers him not, in greater anger, to prosper in his sins, but in
His mercy scourgeth him with the left,4264 that He may place him purified on His right
hand.4265 The reading of most copies, “make Thy right hand well known to me,” may be
referred either to Christ, or to eternal happiness: for God has not a right hand in bodily
shape, as He has not that anger which is aroused into violent passion.
13. But what he addeth,4266 “and those fettered in heart in wisdom;” other copies read,
“instructed,” not “lettered:” the Greek verb, expressing both senses, only differing by a single

syllable.4267 But since these also, as it is said, put their “feet in the fetters” of wisdom, are
taught wisdom (he means the feet of the heart, not of the body), and bound by its golden
chains4268 depart not from the path of God, and become not runaways from him; whichever
reading we adopt, the truth in the meaning is safe. Them thus lettered, or instructed in heart
in wisdom, God makes so well known in the New Testament, that they despised all things
for the Faith which the impiety of Jews and Gentiles abhorred; and allowed themselves to
be deprived of those things which in the Old Testament are thought high promises by those
who judge after the flesh.
14. And as when they became so well known, as to despise these things, and by setting
their affections on things eternal, gave a testimony through their sufferings (whence they
are called witnesses or martyrs in the Greek), they endured for a long while many bitter
temporal afflictions. This man of God giveth heed to this, and the prophetic spirit under
the name of Moses continues thus, “Return, O Lord, how long? and be softened concerning
Thy servants” (ver. 13). These are the words of those, who, enduring many evils in that
persecuting age, become known because their hearts are bound in the chain of wisdom so
firmly, that not even such hardships can induce them to fly from their Lord to the good
things of this world. “How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me, O Lord?”4269 occurs in
another Psalm, in unison with this sentence, “Return, O Lord, how long?” And that they
who, in a most carnal spirit, ascribe to God the form of a human body, may know that the
“turning away” and “turning again” of His countenance is not like those motions of our
own frame, let them recollect these words from above in the same Psalm, “Thou hast set
our misdeeds before Thee, and our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance.” How then
does he say in this passage, “Return,” that God may be favourable, as if He had turned away
His face in anger; when as in the former he speaks of God’s anger in such a manner, as to
insinuate that He had not turned away His countenance from the misdeeds and the course
of life of those He was angry with, but rather had set them before Him, and in the light of
His countenance? The word, “How long,” belongs to righteousness beseeching, not indignant
impatience. “Be softened,” some have rendered by a verb, “soften.” But “be softened” avoids
an ambiguity; since to soften is a common verb: for he may be said to soften who pours out
prayers, and he to whom they are poured out: for we say, I soften thee, and I soften toward
thee.4270
15. Next, in anticipation of future blessings, of which he speaks as already vouchsafed,
he says, “We are satisfied with Thy mercy in the morning” (ver. 14). Prophecy has thus been

kindled for us, in the midst of these toils and sorrows of the night, like a lamp in the darkness,
until day dawn, and the Day-star arise in our hearts.4271 For blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God: then shall the righteous be filled with that blessing for which they
hunger and thirst now,4272 while, walking in faith, they are absent from the Lord.4273 Hence
are the words, “In Thy presence is fulness of joy:”4274 and, “Early in the morning they shall
stand by, and shall look up:”4275 and as other translators have said it, “We shall be satisfied
with Thy mercy in the morning;” then they shall be satisfied. As he says elsewhere, “I shall
be satisfied, when Thy glory shall be revealed.”4276 So it is said, “Lord, show us the Father,
and it sufficeth us:” and our Lord Himself answereth, “I will manifest Myself to Zion;”4277
and until this promise is fulfilled, no blessing satisfies us, or ought to do so, lest our longings
should be arrested in their course, when they ought to be increased until they gain their
objects. “And we rejoiced and were glad all the days of our life.” Those days are days without
end: they all exist together: it is thus they satisfy us: for they give not way to days succeeding:
since there is nothing there which exists not yet because it has not reached us, or ceases to
exist because it has passed; all are together: because there is one day only, which remains
and passes not away: this is eternity itself. These are the days respecting which it is written,
“What man is he that lusteth to live, and would fain see good days?”4278 These days in an-
other passage are styled years: where unto God it is said, “But Thou art the same, and Thy
years shall not fail:”4279 for these are not years that are accounted for nothing, or days that
perish like a shadow: but they are days which have a real existence, the number of which he
who thus spoke, “Lord, let me know mine end” (that is, after reaching what term I shall re-
main unchanged, and have no further blessing to crave), “and the number of my days, what
it is” (what is, not what is not): prayed to know. He distinguishes them from the days of this
life, of which he speaks as follows, “Behold, Thou hast made my days as it were a span
long,”4280 which are not, because they stand not, remain not, but change in quick succession:
nor is there a single hour in them in which our being is not such, but that one part of it has
already passed, another is about to come, and none remains as it is. But those years and

days, in which we too shall never fail, but evermore be refreshed, will never fail. Let our
souls long earnestly for those days, let them thirst ardently for them, that there we may be
filled, be satisfied, and say what we now say in anticipation, “We have been satisfied,” etc.
“We have been comforted again now, after the time that Thou hast brought us low, and for
the years wherein we have seen evil” (ver. 15).
16. But now in days that are as yet evil, let us speak as follows. “Look upon Thy servants,
and upon Thy works” (ver. 16). For Thy servants themselves are Thy works, not only inas-
much as they are men, but as Thy servants, that is, obedient to Thy commands. For we are
His workmanship, created not merely in Adam, but in Christ Jesus, unto good works, which
God hath before ordained that we should walk in them:4281 “for it is God which worketh
in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.”4282 “And direct their sons:” that they
may be right in heart, for to such God is bountiful; for “God is bountiful to Israel, to those
that are right in heart.”…
17. “And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us” (ver. 17); whence the words,
“O Lord, the light of Thy countenance is marked upon us.”4283 And, “Make Thou straight
the works of our hands upon us:” that we may do them not for hope of earthly reward: for
then they are not straight, but crooked. In many copies the Psalm goes thus far, but in some
there is found an additional verse at the end, as follows, “And make straight the work of our
hands.” To these words the learned have prefixed a star, called an asterisk, to show that they
are found in the Hebrew, or in some other Greek translations, but not in the Septuagint.
The meaning of this verse, if we are to expound it, appears to me this, that all our good
works are one work of love: for love is the fulfilling of the Law.4284 For as in the former
verse he had said, “And the works of our hands make Thou straight upon us,” here he says
“work,” not works, as if anxious to show, in the last verse, that all our works are one, that
is, are directed with a view to one work. For then are works righteous, when they are directed
to this one end: “for the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a
good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.”4285 There is therefore one work, in which are all,
“faith which worketh by love:”4286 whence our Lord’s words in the Gospel, “This is the work
of God, that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent.”4287 Since, therefore, in this Psalm, both
old and new life, life both mortal and everlasting, years that are counted for nought, and

years that have the fulness of loving-kindness and of true joy, that is, the penalty of the first
and the reign of the Second Man, are marked so very clearly; I imagine, that the name of
Moses, the man of God, became the title of the Psalm, that pious and right-minded readers
of the Scriptures might gain an intimation that the Mosaic laws, in which God appears to
promise only, or nearly only, earthly rewards for good works, without doubt contains under
a veil some such hopes as this Psalm displays. But when any one has passed over to Christ,
the veil will be taken away:4288 and his eyes will be unveiled, that he may consider the
wonderful things in the law of God, by the gift of Him, to whom we pray, “Open Thou mine
eyes, and I shall see the wondrous things of Thy law.4289

Psalm XC
Psalm XCI.4290
1. This Psalm is that from which the Devil dared to tempt our Lord Jesus Christ: let us
therefore attend to it, that thus armed, we may be enabled to resist the tempter, not presuming
in ourselves, but in Him who before us was tempted, that we might not be overcome when
tempted. Temptation to Him was not necessary: the temptation of Christ is our learning,
but if we listen to His answers to the devil, in order that, when ourselves are tempted, we
may answer in like manner, we are then entering through the gate, as ye have heard it read
in the Gospel. For what is to enter by the gate? To enter by Christ, who Himself said, “I am
the door:”4291 and to enter through Christ, is to imitate His ways.…He urges us to imitate
Him in those works which He could not have done had He not been made Man; for how
could He endure sufferings, unless He had become a Man? How could He otherwise have
died, been crucified, been humbled? Thus then do thou, when thou sufferest the troubles
of this world, which the devil, openly by men, or secretly, as in Job’s case, inflicts; be cour-
ageous, be of long suffering; “thou shalt dwell under the defence of the Most High,” as this
Psalm expresses it: for if thou depart from the help of the Most High, without strength to
aid thyself, thou wilt fall.
2. For many men are brave, when they are enduring persecution from men, and see
them openly rage against themselves: imagining they are then imitating the sufferings of
Christ, in case men openly persecute them; but if assailed by the hidden attack of the devil,
they believe they are not being crowned by Christ. Never fear when thou dost imitate Christ.
For when the devil tempted our Lord, there was no man in the wilderness; he tempted Him
secretly; but he was conquered, and conquered too when openly attacking Him. This do
thou, if thou wishest to enter by the door, when the enemy secretly assails thee, when he
asks for a man that he may do him some hurt by bodily troubles, by fever, by sickness, or
any other bodily sufferings, like those of Job. He saw not the devil, yet he acknowledged the
power of God. He knew that the devil had no power against him, unless from the Almighty
Ruler of all things he received that power: the whole glory he gave to God, power to the
devil he gave not.…
3. He then who so imitates Christ as to endure all the troubles of this world, with his
hopes set upon God, that he falls into no snare, is broken down by no panic fears, he it is
“who dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, who shall abide under the protection
of God” (ver. 1), in the words with which the Psalm, which you have heard and sung, begins.
You will recognise the words, so well known, in which the devil tempted our Lord, when
we come to them. “He shall say unto the Lord, Thou art my taker up, and my refuge: my
God” (ver. 2). Who speaks thus to the Lord? “He who dwelleth under the defence of the
4290 Lat. XC.
4291 John x. 7.
Psalm XCI
Psalm XCI
Most High:” not under his own defence. Who is this? He dwelleth under the defence of the
Most High, who is not proud, like those who ate, that they might become as Gods, and lost
the immortality in which they were made. For they chose to dwell under a defence of their
own, not under that of the Most High: thus they listened to the suggestions of the serpent,4292
and despised the precept of God: and discovered at last that what God threatened, not what
the devil promised, had come to pass in them.
4. Thus then do thou say also, “In Him will I trust. For He Himself shall deliver me”
(ver. 3), not I myself. Observe whether he teaches anything but this, that all our trust be in
God, none in man. Whence shall he deliver thee? “From the snare of the hunter, and from
a harsh word.” Deliverance from the hunter’s net is indeed a great blessing: but how is de-
liverance from a harsh word so? Many have fallen into the hunter’s net through a harsh
word. What is it that I say? The devil and his angels spread their snares, as hunters do: and
those who walk in Christ tread afar from those snares: for he dares not spread his net in
Christ: he sets it on the verge of the way, not in the way. Let then thy way be Christ, and
thou shalt not fall into the snares of the devil.…
But what is, “from a harsh word”? The devil has entrapped many by a harsh word: for
instance, those who profess Christianity among Pagans suffer insult from the heathen: they
blush when they hear reproach, and shrinking out of their path in consequence, fall into
the hunter’s snares. And yet what will a harsh word do to you? Nothing. Can the snares with
which the enemy entraps you by means of reproaches, do nothing to you? Nets are usually
spread for birds at the end of a hedge, and stones are thrown into the hedge: those stones
will not harm the birds. When did any one ever hit a bird by throwing a stone into a hedge?
But the bird, frightened at the harmless noise, falls into the nets; and thus men who fear the
vain reproaches of their calumniators, and who blush at unprovoked insults, fall into the
snares of the hunters, and are taken captive by the devil…Just as among the heathen, the
Christian who fears their reproaches falls into the snare of the hunter: so among the Chris-
tians, those who endeavour to be more diligent and better than the rest, are doomed to bear
insults from Christians themselves. What then doth it profit, my brother, if thou occasionally
find a city in which there is no heathen? No one there insults a man because he is a Christian,
for this reason, that there is no Pagan therein: but there are many Christians who lead a bad
life, among whom those who are resolved to live righteously, and to be sober among the
drunken, and chaste among the unchaste, and amid the consulters of astrologers sincerely
to worship God, and to ask after no such things, and among spectators of frivolous shows
will go only to church, suffer from those very Christians reproaches, and harsh words, when
they address such a one, “Thou art the mighty, the righteous, thou art Elias, thou art Peter:
thou hast come from heaven.” They insult him: whichever way he turns, he hears harsh
4292 Gen. iii. 5.
Psalm XCI
sayings on each side: and if he fears, and abandons the way of Christ, he falls into the snares
of the hunters. But what is it, when he hears such words, not to swerve from the way? On
hearing them, what comfort has he, which prevents his heeding them, and enables him to
enter by the door? Let him say; What words am I called, who am a servant and a sinner? To
my Lord Jesus they said, “Thou hast a devil.”4293 You have just heard the harsh words spoken
against our Lord: it was not necessary for our Lord to suffer this, but in doing so He has
warned thee against harsh words, lest thou fall into the snares of the hunters.
5. “He shall defend thee between His shoulders, and thou shalt hope under His wings”
(ver. 4). He says this, that thy protection may not be to thee from thyself, that thou mayest
not imagine that thou canst defend thyself; He will defend thee, to deliver thee from the
hunter’s snare, and from an harsh word. The expression, “between His shoulders,” may be
understood both in front and behind: for the shoulders are about the head; but in the words,
“thou shalt hope under His wings,” it is clear that the protection of the wings of God expan-
ded places thee between His shoulders, so that God’s wings on this side and that have thee
in the midst, where thou shalt not fear lest any one hurt thee: only be thou careful never to
leave that spot, where no foe dares approach. If the hen defends her chickens beneath her
wings; how much more shalt thou be safe beneath the wings of God, even against the devil
and his angels, the powers who fly about in mid air like hawks, to carry off the weak young
one? For the comparison of the hen to the very Wisdom of God is not without ground; for
Christ Himself, our Lord and Saviour, speaks of Himself as likened to a hen; “how often
would I have gathered thy children,” etc.4294 That Jerusalem would not: let us be willing.…If
you consider other birds, brethren, you will find many that hatch their eggs, and keep their
young warm: but none that weakens herself in sympathy with her chickens, as the hen does.
We see swallows, sparrows, and storks outside their nests, without being able to decide
whether they have young or no: but we know the hen to be a mother by the weakness of her
voice, and the loosening of her feathers: she changes altogether from love for her chickens:
she weakens herself because they are weak. Thus since we were weak, the Wisdom of God
made Itself weak, when the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us,4295 that we might hope
under His wings.
6. “His truth shall surround thee with a shield” (ver. 5). What are “the wings,” the same
is “the shield:” since there are neither wings nor shield. If either were literally, how could
the one be the same as the other? can wings be a shield or a shield wings? But all these ex-
pressions, indeed, are figuratively used through likenesses. If Christ were really a Stone,4296

and Lamb,4298 and Stone, and Calf, and anything else of the sort, metaphorically, because
He is neither Stone, nor Lion, nor Lamb, nor Calf, but Jesus Christ, the Saviour of all of us,
for these are likenesses, not literal names. “His truth shall be thy shield,” it is said: a shield
to assure us that He will not confound those whose trust is in themselves with those who
hope in God. One is a sinner, and the other a sinner: but suppose one that presumes upon
himself is a despiser, confesses not his sins, and he will say, if my sins displeased God, He
would not suffer me to live. But another dared not even raise his eyes, but beat upon his
breast, saying, “God be merciful to me a sinner.”4299 Both this was a sinner, and that: but
the one mocked, the other mourned: the one was a despiser, the other a confessor, of his
sins. But the truth of God, which respects not persons, discerns the penitent from him who
denies his sin, the humble from the proud, him who presumes upon himself from him who
presumes on God. “Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night.”
7. “Nor for the arrow that flieth by day, for the matter4300 that walketh in darkness, nor
for the ruin and the devil that is in the noonday” (ver. 6). These two clauses above correspond
to the two below; “Thou shalt not fear” for “the terror by night, from the arrow that flieth
by day:” both because of “the terror by night,” from “the matter that walketh in darkness:”
and because of “the arrow that flieth by day,” from “the ruin of the devil of the noon-day.”
What ought to be feared by night, and what by day? When any man sins in ignorance, he
sins, as it were, by night: when he sins in full knowledge, by day. The two former sins then
are the lighter: the second are much heavier; but this is obscure, and will repay your attention,
if, by God’s blessing, I can explain it so that you may understand it. He calls the light
temptation, which the ignorant yield to, “terror by night:” the light temptation, which assails
men who well know, “the arrow that flieth by day.” What are light temptations? Those which
do not press upon us so urgently, as to overcome us, but may pass by quickly if declined.
Suppose these, again, heavy ones. If the persecutor threatens, and frightens the ignorant
grievously, I mean those whose faith is as yet unstable, and know not that they are Christians
that they may hope for a life to come; as soon as they are alarmed with temporal ills, they
imagine that Christ has forsaken them, and that they are Christians to no purpose; they are
not aware that they are Christians for this reason, that they may conquer the present, and
hope for the future: the matter that walketh in darkness has found and seized them. But
some there are who know that they are called to a future hope; that what God has promised
is not of this life, or this earth; that all these temptations must be endured, that we may receive
4297 Rev. v. 5.

Psalm XCI
what God hath promised us for evermore; all this they know: when however the persecutor
urges them more strenuously, and plies them with threats, penalties, tortures, at length they
yield, and although they are well aware of their sin, yet they fall as it were by day.
8. But why does he say, “at noon-day”? The persecution is very hot; and thus the noon
signifies the excessive heat.…The demon that is “in the noon-day,” represents the heat of a
furious persecution: for these are our Lord’s words, “The sun was up; and because they had
no root, they withered away:” and when explaining it, He applies it to those who are offended
when persecution ariseth, “Because they have not root in themselves.” We are therefore
right in understanding by the demon that destroyeth in the noon-day, a violent persecution.
Listen, beloved, while I describe the persecution, from which the Lord hath rescued His
Church. At first, when the emperors and kings of the world imagined that they could extirpate
from the earth the Christian name by persecution, they proclaimed, that any one who con-
fessed himself a Christian, should be smitten. He who did not choose to be smitten, denied
that he was a Christian, knowing the sin he was committing: the arrow that flieth by day
reached him. But whoever regarded not the present life, but had a sure trust in a future one,
avoided the arrow, by confessing himself a Christian; smitten in the flesh, he was liberated
in the spirit: resting with God, he began peacefully to await the redemption of his body in
the resurrection of the dead: he escaped from that temptation, from the arrow that flieth by
day. “Whoever professes himself a Christian, let him be beheaded;” was as the arrow that
flieth by day. The “devil that is in the noon-day” was not yet abroad, burning with a terrible
persecution, and afflicting with great heat even the strong. For hear what followed; when
the enemy saw that many were hastening to martyrdom, and that the number of fresh con-
verts increased in proportion to that of the sufferers, they said among themselves, We shall
annihilate the human race, so many thousands are there who believe in His Name; if we kill
all of them, there will hardly be a survivor on earth. The sun then began to blaze, and to
glow with a terrible heat. Their first edict had been, Whoever shall confess himself a Chris-
tian, let him be smitten. Their second edict was, Whoever shall have confessed himself a
Christian, let him be tortured, and tortured even until he deny himself a Christian.…Many
therefore who denied not,4301 failed amid the tortures; for they were tortured until they
denied. But to those who persevered in professing Christ, what could the sword do, by killing
the body at one stroke, and sending the soul to God? This was the result of protracted tortures
also: yet who could be found able to resist such cruel and continued torments? Many failed:
those, I believe, who presumed upon themselves, who dwelt not under the defence of the
Most High, and under the shadow of the God of Heaven; who said not to the Lord, “Thou
art my lifter up:” who trusted not beneath the shadow of His wings, but reposed much
confidence in their own strength. They are thrown down by God, to show them that it is
4301 [Under the first edict.—C.]
Psalm XCI
He that protects them, He overrules their temptations, He allows so much only to befall
them, as each person can sustain.
9. Many then fell before the demon of the noon-day. Would ye know how many? He
goes on, and says, “A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
but it shall not come nigh thee” (ver. 7). To whom, brethren, but to Christ Jesus, is this
said?…For the members, the body, and the head, are not separate from one another: the
body and the head are the Church and her Saviour. How then is it said, “A thousand shall
fall beside thee, and ten thousand by thy right hand”? Because they shall fall before the
devil, that destroyeth at noon. It is a terrible thing, my brethren, to fall from beside Christ,
from His right hand but how shall they fall from beside Him? Why the one beside Him, the
other at His right hand? Why a thousand beside Him, ten thousand at His right hand? Why
a thousand beside Him? Because a thousand are fewer than the ten thousand who shall fall
at His right hand. Who these are will soon be clear in Christ’s name; for to some He promised
that they should judge with Him, namely, to the Apostles, who left all things, and followed
Him.…Those judges then are the heads of the Church, the perfect. To such He said, “If thou
wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor.”4302 What means the expres-
sion, “if thou wilt be perfect”? it means, if thou wilt judge with Me, and not be judged.…Many
such at that period, who had distributed their all to the poor, and already promised themselves
a seat beside Christ in judgment of the nations, failed amid their torments under the blazing
fire of persecution, as before the demon of the noon-day, and denied Christ. These are they
who have fallen “beside” Him: when about to sit with Christ for the judgment of the world,
they fell.
10. I will now explain who are they who fall on the right hand of Christ.…And because
many have fallen from that hope of being judges, but yet many, many more from that of
being on His right hand, the Psalmist thus addresses Christ, “A thousand shall fall beside
Thee, and ten thousand at Thy right hand.” And since there shall be many, who regarded
not all these things, with whom, as it were with His own limbs, Christ is one, he adds, “But
it shall not come nigh Thee.” Were these words addressed to the Head alone? Surely not;
surely neither (doth it come nigh) to Paul, nor Peter, nor all the Apostles, nor all the Martyrs,
who failed not in their torments. What then do the words, “it shall not come nigh,” mean?
Why were they thus tortured? The torture came nigh the flesh, but it did not reach the region
of faith. Their faith then was far beyond the reach of the terrors threatened by their torturers.
Let them torture, terror will not come nigh; let them torture, but they will mock the torture,
putting their trust in Him who conquered before them, that the rest might conquer. And
who conquer, except they who trust not in themselves?…Who will not fear? He who trusts
not in himself, but in Christ. But those who trust in themselves, although they even hope
4302 Matt. xix. 21.
Psalm XCI
to judge at the side of Christ, although they hoped they should be at His right hand, as if
He said to them, “Come, ye blessed of My Father,” etc.; yet the devil that is at noon overtook
them, the raging heat of persecution, terrifying with violence; and many fell from the hope
of the seat of judgment, of whom it is said, “A thousand shall fall beside thee;” many too fell
from the hope of reward for their duties,4303 of whom it was said, “And ten thousand at thy
right hand.” But this downfall and devil that is at noon-day “shall not come nigh thee,” that
is, the Head and the body; for the Lord knows who are His.4304
11. “Nevertheless, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the ungodly”
(ver. 8). What is this? Why “nevertheless”? Because the wicked were allowed to tyrannize
over Thy servants, and to persecute them. Will they then have been allowed to persecute
Thy servants with impunity? Not with impunity, for although Thou hast permitted them,
and Thine own have thence received a brighter crown, “nevertheless,” etc. For the evil which
they willed, not the good they unconsciously were the agents of, will be recompensed them.
All that is wanting is the eye of faith, by which we may see that they are raised for a time
only, while they shall mourn for evermore; and to those into whose hands is given temporal
power over the servants of God, it shall be said, “Depart into everlasting fire, prepared for
the devil and his angels.”4305 But if every man have but eyes in the sense in which it is said,
“With thine eyes shalt thou behold,” it is no unimportant thing to look upon the wicked
flourishing in this life, and to have an eye to him, to consider what will become of him in
the end, if he fail to reform his ways: for those who now would thunder upon others, will
afterwards feel the thunderbolt themselves.
12. “For Thou, Lord, art my hope” (ver. 9). He has now come to the power Which rescues
him from falling by the “downfall and the devil of the noon-day.” “For Thou, Lord, art my
hope: Thou hast set Thy house of defence very high.” What do the words “very high” mean?
For many make their house of defence in God a mere refuge from temporal persecution;
but the defence of God is on high, and very secret, whither thou mayest fly from the wrath
to come. Within “Thou hast set thine house of defence very high. There shall no evil happen
unto Thee: neither shall any plague come nigh Thy dwelling” (ver. 10).
13. The Holy City is not the Church of this country only, but of the whole world as well:
not that of this age only, but from Abel himself down to those who shall to the end be born
and believe in Christ, the whole assembly of the Saints, belonging to one city; which city is
Christ’s body, of which Christ is the Head. There, too, dwell the Angels, who are our fellow-
citizens: we toil, because we are as yet pilgrims: while they within that city are awaiting our
arrival. Letters have reached us too from that city, apart from which we are wandering: those
4303 Obsequiorum.
4304 2 Tim. ii. 19.
4305 Matt. xxv. 41.
Psalm XCI
letters are the Scriptures, which exhort us to live well. Why do I speak of letters only? The
King himself descended, and became a path to us in our wanderings: that walking in Him,
we may neither stray, nor faint nor fall among robbers, nor be caught in the snares that are
set near our path. This character, then, we recognise in the whole Person of Christ, together
with the Church.…He Himself is our Head, He is God, co-equal with the Father, the Word
of God, by whom all things were made:4306 but God to create, Man to renew; God to make,
Man to restore. Looking upon Him, then, let us hear the Psalm. Listen, beloved. This is the
teaching and doctrine of this school, which may enable you to understand, not this Psalm
only, but many, if ye keep in mind this rule. Sometimes a Psalm, and all prophecy as well,
in speaking of Christ, praises the Head alone, and sometimes from the Head goes to the
Body, that is, the Church, and without apparently changing the Person spoken of: because
the Head is not separate from the Body, and both are spoken of as one…
14. What then, my brethren, what is said of our Head? “For Thou, Lord, art my hope,”
etc. Of this we have spoken, “for He hath given His angels charge over Thee, to keep Thee
in all Thy ways” (ver. 11). You heard these words but now, when the Gospel was being read;
attend therefore. Our Lord, after He was baptized, fasted. Why was He baptized? That we
might not scorn to be baptized. For when John said to our Lord, “Comest Thou to me to be
baptized? I ought to be baptized by Thee;” and our Lord replied, “Suffer it to be so now, for
thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness;”4307 He wished to fulfil all humility, so that
He should be washed, who had no defilement.…Our Lord, then, was baptized, and after
baptism He was tempted; He fasted forty days, a number which has, as I have often men-
tioned, a deep meaning. All things cannot be explained at once, lest needful time be too
much taken up. After forty days He was an hungred. He could have fasted without ever
feeling hunger; but then how could He be tempted? or had He not overcome the tempter,
how couldest thou learn to struggle with him? He was hungry; and then the tempter said,
“If Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” Was it a great thing
for our Lord Jesus Christ to make bread out of stones, when He satisfied so many thousands
with five loaves? He made bread out of nothing. For whence came that quantity of food,
which could satisfy so many thousands? The sources of that bread are in the Lord’s hands.
This is nothing wonderful; for He Himself made out of five loaves bread enough for so many
thousands,4308 who also every day out of a few seeds raises up on earth immense harvests.
These are the miracles of our Lord: but from their constant operation they are disregarded.
What then, my brethren, was it impossible for the Lord to create bread out of stones? He
made men even out of stones, in the words of John the Baptist himself, “God is able of these
4306 John i. 3.
4307 Matt. iii. 14, 15.
4308 Matt. xiv. 17, 21.
Psalm XCI
stones to raise up children unto Abraham.”4309 Why then did He not so? That he might
teach thee how to answer the tempter, so that if thou wast reduced to any straits and the
tempter suggested, if thou wast a Christian and belongedst to Christ, would He desert thee
now?…Listen to our Lord: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro-
ceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Dost thou think the word of God bread? If the Word of
God, through which all things were made, was not bread, He would not say, “I am the bread
which came down from heaven.”4310 Thou hast therefore learnt to answer the tempter,
when pressed with hunger.
15. What if he tempt thee in these words: If thou wast a Christian, thou wouldest do
miracles, as many Christians have done? Thou, deceived by a wicked suggestion, wouldest
tempt the Lord thy God, so as to say to Him, If I am a Christian, and am before Thine eyes,
and Thou dost account me at all in the number of Thine own, let me also do something like
the many works which Thy Saints have done. Thou hast tempted God, as if thou wert not
a Christian, unless thou didst this. Many who desired such things have fallen. For that Simon
the sorcerer desired such gifts of the Apostles, when he wished to buy the Holy Spirit for
money.4311 He loved the power of working miracles, but loved not the imitation of humil-
ity.…What then, if he tempt thee thus, “work miracles”? that thou mayest not tempt God,
what shouldest thou answer? What our Lord answered. The devil said to Him, “Cast Thyself
down; for it is written, He shall give His Angels charge concerning Thee,” etc. If Thou shalt
cast Thyself down, Angels shall receive Thee. And it might indeed, my brethren, happen, if
our Lord had cast Himself down, the attending Angels would receive our Lord’s flesh; but
what does He say to him? “It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”4312
Thou thinkest Me a man. For the devil came to Him with this view, that he might try
whether He were the Son of God. He saw His Flesh; but His might appeared in His works:
the Angels had borne witness. He saw that He was mortal, so that he might tempt Him, that
by Christ’s temptation the Christian might be taught. What then is written? “Thou shalt
not tempt the Lord thy God.” Let us not then tempt the Lord, so as to say, If we belong to
Thee, let us work a miracle.
16. Let us return to the words of the Psalm. “They shall bear Thee in their hands, lest
at any time Thou hurt Thy foot against a stone” (ver. 12). Christ was raised up in the hands
of Angels, when He was taken up into heaven: not that, if Angels had not sustained Him,
He would have fallen: but because they were attending on their King. Say not, Those who
sustained Him are better than He who was sustained. Are then cattle better than men, because
4309 Matt. iii. 9.
4310 John vi. 41.
4311 Acts viii. 18.
4312 Deut. vi. 16.
Psalm XCI
they sustain the weakness of men? And we ought not to speak thus either; for if the cattle
withdraw their support, their riders fall. But how ought we to speak of it? For it is said even
of God, “Heaven is My throne.”4313 Because then heaven supports Him, and God sits
thereon, is therefore heaven the better? Thus also in this Psalm we may understand it of the
service of the Angels: it does not pertain to any infirmity in our Lord, but to the honour
they pay, and to their service.…What the finger of God is, the Gospel explaineth to us; for
the finger of God is the Holy Ghost. How do we prove this? Our Lord, when answering
those who accused Him of casting out devils in the name of Beelzebub, saith, “If I cast out
devils by the Spirit of God;”4314 and another Evangelist, in relating the same saying, saith,
“If I with the finger of God cast out devils.”4315 What therefore is in one stated clearly, is
darkly expressed in another. Thou didst not know what was the finger of God, but another
Evangelist explains it by terming it the Spirit of God. The Law then written by the finger of
God was given on the fiftieth day after the slaughter of the lamb, and the Holy Ghost des-
cended on the fiftieth day after the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Lamb was slain,
the Passover was celebrated, the fifty days were completed, and the Law was given. But that
Law was to cause fear, not love: but that fear might be changed into love, He who was truly
righteous was slain: of whom that lamb whom the Jews were slaying was the type. He arose
from the dead: and from the day of our Lord’s Passover, as from that of the slaying of the
Paschal lamb, fifty days are counted; and the Holy Ghost descended, now in the fulness of
love, not in the punishment of fear.4316 Why have I said this? For this then our Lord arose,
and was glorified, that He might send His Holy Spirit. And I said long ago that this was so,
because His head is in heaven, His feet on earth. If His head is in heaven, His feet on earth;
what means our Lord’s feet on earth? Our Lord’s saints on earth. Who are our Lord’s feet?
The Apostles sent throughout the whole world. Who are our Lord’s feet? All the Evangelists,
in whom our Lord travelleth over all nations.…We need not therefore wonder that our Lord
was raised up to heaven by the hands of Angels, that His foot might not dash against a stone:
lest those who on earth toiled in His body, while they were travelling over the whole world
might become guilty of the Law, He took from them fear, and filled them with love. Through
fear Peter thrice denied Him,4317 for he had not yet received the Holy Ghost: afterwards,
when he had received the Holy Spirit, he began to preach with confidence.…Our Lord so
dealt with him, as if He said, thrice thou hast denied Me through fear: thrice confess Me
through love. With that love and that charity He filled His disciples. Why? Because He hath

4315 Luke xi. 20.
4316 Acts ii. 1–4.
4317 Matt. xxvi. 69–75.
Psalm XCI
set His house of defence very high: because when glorified He sent the Holy Ghost, He re-
leased the faithful from the guilt of the Law, that His feet might not dash against a stone.
17. “Thou4318 shalt go upon the asp and the basilisk; the lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet” (ver. 13). Ye know who the serpent is, and how the Church treadeth
upon him, as she is not conquered, because she is on her guard against his cunning. And
after what manner he is a lion and a dragon, I believe you know also, beloved. The lion
openly rages, the dragon lies secretly in covert: the devil hath each of these forces and powers.
When the Martyrs were being slain, it was the raging lion: when heretics are plotting, it is
the dragon creeping beneath us. Thou hast conquered the lion; conquer also the dragon:
the lion hath not crushed4319 thee, let not the dragon deceive thee.…A few women in the
Church have bodily virginity: but the virginity of the heart all the faithful have. In the very
matter of faith he feared that the heart’s virginity would be corrupted by the devil: and those
who have lost it, are uselessly virgins in their bodies. What does a woman who is corrupt in
heart preserve in her body? Thus a Catholic married woman is before a virgin heretic. For
the first is not indeed a virgin in her body, but the second has become married in her heart;
and married not unto God as her husband, but unto the dragon. But what shall the Church
do? The basilisk is the king of serpents, as the devil is the king of wicked spirits.
18. These are the words of God to the Church. “Because he hath set his love in me,
therefore will I deliver him” (ver. 14). Not only therefore the Head, which now sits in
heaven, because He hath set His house of defence very high, to which no evil shall happen,
neither shall any plague come nigh His dwelling; but we also who are toiling on earth, and
are still living in temptations, whose steps are feared for, lest they fall into snares, may hear
the voice of the Lord our God consoling us, and saying to us, “Because he hath set his love
upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him up, because he hath known my name.”
19. “He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble” (ver. 15).
Fear not when thou art in trouble, as if the Lord were not with thee. Let faith be with thee,
and God is with thee in thy trouble. There are waves on the sea, and thou art tossed in thy
bark, because Christ sleepeth. Christ slept in the ship, while the men were perishing.4320 If
thy faith sleep in thy heart, Christ is as it were sleeping in thy ship: because Christ dwelleth
in thee through faith, when thou beginnest to be tossed, awake Christ sleeping: rouse up
thy faith, and thou shalt be assured that He deserts thee not. But thou thinkest thou art
forsaken, because He rescueth thee not when thou thyself dost wish. He delivered the Three
Children from the fire?4321 Did He, who did this, desert the Maccabees?4322 God forbid!

He delivered both of these: the first bodily, that the faithless might be confounded; the last
spiritually, that the faithful might imitate them. “I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.”
20. “With length of days will I satisfy him” (ver. 16). What is length of days? Eternal
life. Brethren, imagine not that length of days is spoken of in the same sense as days are said
to be long in summer, short in winter. Hath he such days to give us? That length is one that
hath no end, eternal life, that is promised us in long days. And truly, since this sufficeth,
with reason he saith, “will I satisfy him.” What is long in time, if it hath an end, satisfieth
us not: for that reason it should not be even called long. And if we are covetous, we ought
to be covetous of eternal life: long for such a life, as hath no end. Lo, a line in which our
covetousness may be extended. Dost thou wish money without limit? Long for eternal life
without limit. Dost thou wish that thy possession may have no end? Seek for eternal life. “I
will show him my salvation.” Nor is this, my brethren, to be briefly passed over. “I will show
him my salvation:” He means, I will show him Christ Himself. Why? Was He not seen on
earth? What great thing hath He to show us? But He did not appear such as we shall see
Him. He appeared in that shape in which those who saw Him crucified Him: behold, those
who saw Him, crucified Him: we have not seen Him, yet we have believed. They had eyes,
have not we? yea, we too have the eyes of the heart: but, as yet we see through faith, not by
sight. When will it be sight? When shall we, as the Apostle saith, see Him “face to face”?4323
which God promiseth us as the high reward of all our toils. Whatever thou toilest in, thou
toilest for this purpose, that thou mayest see Him. Some great thing it is we are to see, since
all our reward is seeing; and our Lord Jesus Christ is that very great sight. He who appeared
humble, will Himself appear great, and will rejoice us, as He is even now seen of His An-
gels.…Let us love and imitate Him: let us run after his ointments, as is said in the Song of
Solomon: “Because of the savour of thy good ointments, we will run after thee.”4324 For He
came, and gave forth a savour that filled the world. Whence was that fragrance? From
heaven. Follow then towards heaven, if thou do not answer4325 falsely when it is said, “Lift
up your hearts,” lift up your thoughts, your love, your hope: that it may not rot upon the
earth.…“For wherever thy treasure is, there will be thy heart also.”4326

Psalm XCI
Psalm XCII.4327
1. …We are not Christians, except on account of a future life: let no one hope for present
blessings, let no one promise himself the happiness of the world, because he is a Christian:
but let him use the happiness he hath, as he may, in what manner he may, when he may, as
far as he may. When it is present, let him give thanks for the consolation of God: when it is
wanting, let him give thanks to the Divine justice. Let him always be grateful, never ungrate-
ful: let him be grateful to his Father, who soothes and caresses him: and grateful to his
Father when He chasteneth him with the scourge, and teacheth him: for He ever loveth,
whether He caress or threaten: and let him say what ye have heard in the Psalm: “It is a good
thing to give thanks unto the Lord; and to sing praises unto Thy Name, Thou Most Highest”
(ver. 1).
2. This Psalm is entitled, a Psalm to be sung on the Sabbath day. Lo, this day is the
Sabbath, which the Jews at this period observe by a kind of bodily rest, languid and luxurious.
They abstain from labours, and give themselves up to trifles; and though God ordained the
Sabbath, they spend it in actions which God forbids. Our rest is from evil works, theirs from
good; for it is better to plough than to dance. They abstain from good, but not from trifling,
works. God proclaims to us a Sabbath. What sort of Sabbath? First consider, where it is. It
is in the heart, within us; for many are idle with their limbs, while they are disturbed in
conscience.…That very joy in the tranquillity of our hope, is our Sabbath. This is the subject
of praise and of song in this Psalm, how a Christian man is in the Sabbath of his own heart,
that is, in the quiet, tranquillity, and serenity of his conscience, undisturbed; hence he tells

own heart.
3. …Accuse thyself, and thou receivest indulgence. Besides, many do not accuse Satan
but their fate. My fate led me, saith one when you ask him, why did you do it? why did you
sin? he replies, by my evil fate. Lest he should say, I did it; he points to God as the source of
his sin: with his tongue he blasphemes. He saith not this indeed openly as yet, but listen,
and see that he saith this. You ask of him, what is fate: and he replies, evil stars. You ask,
who made, who appointed the stars; he can only answer, God. It follows, then, that whether
he doth so directly or indirectly,4328 still he accuseth God, and when God punisheth sins,
he maketh God the author of his own sins. It cannot be that God punishes what He hath
wrought: He punisheth what thou doest, that He may set free what He hath wrought. But
sometimes, setting aside everything else, they attack God directly: and when they sin, they
say, God willed this; if God had not willed it, I should not have sinned. Does He warn thee
for this, that not only He may not be listened to, to keep thee from sin, but even be accused

Psalm XCII
because thou dost sin? What then doth this Psalm teach us? “It is a good thing to confess4329
unto the Lord.” What is to confess unto the Lord? In both cases: both in thy sins, because
thou hast done them; and in thy good works, confess unto the Lord, because He hath done
them. Then shalt thou “sing unto the Name of God, the Most Highest:” seeking the glory
of God, not thine own; His Name, not thine. For if thou seekest the Name of God, He also
seeketh thy name; but if thou hast neglected the Name of God, He also doth blot out thine.…
4. “To tell of Thy mercy early in the morning, and of Thy truth in the night season”
(ver. 2). What is the meaning of this; that the mercy of God is to be told us in the morning,
and in the night the truth of God? The morning is, when it is well with us; the night, the
sadness of tribulation. What then did he say in brief? When thou art prosperous, rejoice in
God, for it is His mercy. Now, perhaps thou wouldest say, If I rejoice in God, when I am
prosperous, because it is His mercy; what am I to do when I am in sorrow, in tribulation?
It is His mercy, when I am prosperous; is it then His cruelty, when I am in adversity? If I
praise His mercy when it is well with me, am I then to exclaim against His cruelty when it
is ill? No. But when it is well, praise His mercy: when ill, praise His truth: because He
scourgeth sins, He is not unjust.…During the night Daniel confessed the truth of God: he
said in his prayer, “We have sinned, and committed iniquity, and have done wickedly. O
Lord, righteousness belongeth unto Thee: but unto us confusion of face.”4330 He told of the
truth of God during the night-season. What is it to tell of the truth of God in the night-sea-
son? Not to accuse God, because thou sufferest aught of evil: but to attribute it to thy sins,
His correction: to tell of His loving-kindness early in the morning, and of His truth in the
night-season. When thou doest this, thou dost always praise God, always confess to God,
and sing unto His Name.
5. “Upon a psaltery of ten strings, with a song, and upon the harp” (ver. 3). Ye have not
heard of the psaltery of ten strings for the first time: it signifies the ten commandments of
the Law. But we must sing upon that psaltery, and not carry it only. For even the Jews have
the Law: but they carry it: they sing not.…“And upon the harp.” This means, in word and
deed; “with a song,” in word; “upon the harp,” in work. If thou speakest words alone, thou
hast, as it were, the song only, and not the harp: if thou workest, and speakest not, thou hast
the harp only. On this account both speak well and do well, if thou wouldest have the song
together with the harp.

Psalm XCII
6. “For Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy works; and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of Thy hands” (ver. 4). Ye see what he saith. Thou hast made me
living well, Thou hast formed me: if by chance I do aught of good, I will rejoice in the work
of Thy hands: as the Apostle saith, “For we are His workmanship, created unto good
works.”4331 For unless He formed thee to good works, thou wouldest not know any works
but evil.…Because thou canst not have truth from thy own self, it remains that thou drink
it thence, whence it floweth: as if thou hast gone back from the light, thou art in darkness:
as a stone glows not with its own heat, but either from the sun or fire, and if thou withdraw
it from the heat, it cools: there it appears, that the heat was not its own; for it became heated
either by the sun or by fire: thus thou also, if thou withdraw from God, wilt become cold;
if thou approach God, thou wilt warm: as the Apostle saith “fervent in spirit.”4332 Also what
saith he of the light? If thou approach Him, thou wilt be in light; therefore saith the Psalm,
“Look upon Him, and be lightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed.”4333 Because
therefore thou canst do no good, unless lightened by the light of God, and warmed by the
spirit of God; when thou shalt see thyself working well, confess unto God, and say what the
Apostle saith; say unto thyself, that thou be not puffed up, “For what hast thou that thou
didst not receive?”4334…
7. That wretched man who doeth good, and suffereth evils, seeth him, becometh dis-
turbed, and saith, O God, the wicked, I imagine, please Thee, and Thou hatest the good,
and lovest those who work iniquity.…The Sabbath being now lost in the inner man, and
the tranquillity of his heart being shut out, and good thoughts repelled, he now beginneth
to imitate him whom he seeth flourishing amid his evil deeds; and turneth himself also to
evil works. But God is long-suffering, because He is eternal,4335 and he knoweth the day of
His own judgment, where He weigheth all things.
8. Teaching us this, what saith he? “O Lord, how glorious are Thy works: Thy thoughts
are made very deep” (ver. 5). Verily, my brethren, there is no sea so deep as these thoughts
of God, who maketh the wicked flourish, and the good suffer: nothing so profound, nothing
so deep: therein every unbelieving soul is wrecked, in that depth, in that profundity. Dost
thou wish to cross this depth? Remove not from the wood of Christ’s Cross: thou shalt not
sink: hold thyself fast to Christ. What do I mean by this, hold fast to Christ? It was for this
reason that He chose to suffer on earth Himself. Ye have heard, while the prophet was being

4335 [Deus autem patiens est quia æternus est. One of those felicitous maxims in which our author
abounds.—C.]
Psalm XCII
read, how He “did not turn away His back from the smiters, and His face from the spittings
of men,” how “He turned not His cheek from their hands;”4336 wherefore chose He to suffer
all these things, but that He might console the suffering? He could have raised His flesh at
the last day: but then thou wouldest not have had thy ground of hope, since thou hadst not
seen Him. He deferred not His resurrection, that thou mightest not still be in doubt. Suffer
then tribulation in the world with the same end as that which thou hast observed in Christ:
and let not those who do evil, and flourish in this life, move thee. “Thy thoughts are very
deep.” Where is the thought of God? Rejoice not as the fish who is exulting in his bait: the
fisherman hath not drawn his hook: the fish hath as yet the hook in his jaws. And what
seemeth to thee long, is short; all these things pass over quickly. What is the long life of man
to the eternity of God? Dost thou wish to be of long-suffering? Consider the eternity of God.
For thou regardest thy few days, and in thy few days thou dost wish all things to be fulfilled.
What things? The condemnation of all the wicked: and the crowning of all the good: dost
thou wish these things to be fulfilled in thy days? God fulfilleth them in His own time. Why
dost thou suffer weariness? He is eternal: He waiteth: He is of long-suffering: but thou sayest,
I am not of long-suffering, because I am mortal. But thou hast it in thy power to become
so: join thy heart to the eternity of God, and with Him thou shalt be eternal.…
9. For this reason, after saying, “Thy thoughts are very deep,” he at once subjoins: “An
unwise man doth not well consider this, and a fool doth not understand it” (ver. 6). What
are the things which an unwise man doth not well consider, and which a fool doth not un-
derstand? “When the ungodly are green as the grass.” What is, “as the grass”? They flourish
when it is winter, but they will wither in the summer. Thou observest the flower of the grass?
What more quickly passeth by? What is brighter? What is greener? Let not its verdure delight
thee, but fear its withering. Thou hast heard of the ungodly being green as the grass: hear
also of the righteous: “For lo.” In the mean while, consider the ungodly; they flourish as the
grass; but who are they who understand it not? The foolish and unwise. “When the ungodly
are green as the grass, and all men look upon the workers of iniquity” (ver. 7). All who in
their heart think not aright of God, look upon the ungodly when they are as green as grass,
that is, when they flourish for a time. Why do they look upon them? “That they may be
destroyed for ever.” For they regard their momentary bloom, they imitate them, and wishing
to flourish with them for a time, perish for evermore: this is, “That they may be destroyed
for ever.”
10. “But Thou, Lord, art the Most Highest for evermore” (ver. 8). Waiting above in Thy
eternity until the season of the wicked be past, and that of the just come. “For lo.” Listen,
brethren. Already he who speaketh (for he speaketh in our person, in the person of Christ’s
body, for Christ speaketh in His own body, that is, in His Church), hath joined himself unto
4336 Isa. l. 6.
Psalm XCII
the eternity of God: as I a little before was saying unto you, God is long-suffering and patient,
and alloweth all those evil deeds which He seeth to be done by wicked men. Wherefore?
because He is eternal, and seeth what He keepeth for them. Dost thou also wish to be long-
suffering and patient? Join thyself to the eternity of God: together with Him wait for those
things which are beneath thee: for when thy heart shall have cleaved unto the Most Highest,
all mortal things will be beneath thee: say then what follows, “For lo, thine enemies shall
perish.” Those who now flourish, shall afterwards perish. Who are the enemies of God?
Brethren, perhaps ye think those only enemies of God who blaspheme? They indeed are so,
and those wicked men who neither in tongue nor in thought cease to injure God. And what
do they do to the eternal, most high God? If thou strike with thy fist upon a pillar, thou art
hurt: and thinkest thou that where thou strikest God with thy blasphemy, thou art not thyself
broken? for thou doest nothing to God. But the enemies of God are openly blasphemers,
and daily they are found hidden. Beware of such enmities of God. For the Scripture revealeth
some such secret enemies of God: that because thou knowest them not in thy heart, thou
mayest know in God’s Scriptures, and beware of being found with them. James saith openly
in his Epistle, “Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?”4337 Thou
hast heard. Dost thou wish not to be an enemy of God? Be not a friend of this world: for if
thou art a friend of this world, thou wilt be an enemy of God. For as a wife cannot be an
adulteress, unless she be an enemy to her own husband: so a soul which is an adulteress
through its love of worldly things, cannot but be an enemy to God. It feareth, but loveth
not: it feareth punishment but is not delighted with righteousness. All lovers of the world,
therefore, are enemies of God, all the curious after trifles, all consulters of diviners astrologers,
and evil spirits. Let them enter, or not enter, Churches: they are enemies of God. They may
flourish for a season like grass, but they will perish, when He beginneth to visit them, and
pronounce His sentence upon all flesh. Join thyself to the Scripture of God, and say with
this Psalm, “For lo, thine enemies shall perish” (ver. 9). Be not found there, where they shall
perish. “And all the workers of iniquity shall be destroyed.”
11. …“But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn” (ver. 10). Why did
He say, “like the horn of an unicorn”? Sometimes an unicorn signifies pride, sometimes it
means the lifting up of unity; because unity is lifted up, all heresies shall perish with the
enemies of God. And “mine horn shall be exalted like an unicorn.” When will it be so? “And
mine old age shall be in the fatness of mercy.”4338 Why did he say, “my old age”? He means,
my last days; as our old age is the last season in our lives, so the whole of what the body of
Christ at present suffereth in labours, in cares, in watchings, in hunger, in thirst, in stumbling-
blocks, in wickednesses, in tribulations, is its youth: its old age, that is, its last days, will be
4337 Jas. iv. 4.
4338 So LXX.
Psalm XCII
in joy. And beware, beloved, that ye think not death meant also, in that he hath spoken of
old age: for man groweth old in the flesh for this reason, that he may die. The old age of the
Church will be white with good works, but it shall not decay through death. What the head
of the old man is, that our works will be. Ye see how the head groweth old, and whiteneth,
as fast as old age approacheth. Thou sometimes dost seek in the head of one who groweth
old duly in his own course a black hair, yet thou findest it not: thus when our life shall have
been such, that the blackness of sins may be sought, and none found, that old age is youthful,
is green, and ever will be green. Ye have heard of the grass of sinners, hear ye of the old age
of the righteous: “My old age shall be in the fathers of mercy.”
12. “And Mine eye hath beheld on mine enemies” (ver. 11). Whom doth he call his en-
emies? All the workers of iniquity. Do not observe whether thy friend be wicked: let an oc-
casion come, and then thou provest him. Thou beginnest to go contrary to his iniquity, and
then thou shalt see that when he was flattering thee, he was thy enemy; but thou hadst not
yet knocked, not to raise in his heart what was not there, but that what was there might
break out. “Mine eye also hath looked upon mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his desire
of the wicked that rise up against me.” When? In my old age. What is, in old age? In the last
times. And what shall our ear hear? Standing on the right hand, we shall hear what shall be
said to them that are on the left.4339
13. The grass withereth, the flower of sinners dieth away: what of the righteous? “The
righteous shall flourish like a palm tree” (ver. 12). The ungodly are green as grass; “The
righteous shall flourish like a palm tree.” By the palm tree he signifieth height. Possibly he
had also this meaning in the palm, that in its extremities it is beautiful: so that thou mayest
trace its beginning from the earth, its end in its topmost branches, wherein its whole beauty
dwelleth. The rough root appeareth in the earth, the beautiful foliage toward the sky. Thy
beauty too, then, shall be in the end. Thy root is fixed fast: but our root is upward. For our
root is Christ, who hath ascended into heaven. Humbled, he shall be exalted; “he shall spread
abroad like a cedar in Libanus.” See what trees he spoke of: the righteous shall flourish like
a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus. When the sun hath gone forth,
doth the palm-tree wither? Doth the cedar die? But when the sun hath been glowing for
some hours, the grass drieth up. The judgment, therefore, shall come, that sinners may
wither, and the faithful flourish.
14. “Such as are planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courts of the house
of our God” (ver. 12). “They shall be yet more increased in fruitful old age, and shall be
quiet, that they may show it forth” (ver. 13). Such is the Sabbath, which but a little while
ago I commended unto you, whence the Psalm hath its title. “They shall be quiet, that they
4339 [The words “my desire” are not in the Hebrew: what the Hebrew implies is the patient expectation of
a just judgment, by which truth shall at last be vindicated. See Rev. vi. 10.—C.]
Psalm XCII
may show it forth.” Wherefore are they quiet that show it forth? The grass of sinners moveth
them not: the cedar and palm-tree not even in tempests are bent. They are therefore quiet,
that they may show it forth: and with reason, since at present they must show it forth even
unto men who mock at it. O wretched men, who are lovers of the world! Those who are
planted in the house of the Lord, show it to you: those who praise the Lord with song and
lute, in word and deed, show it forth to you, and tell you. Be not seduced by the prosperity
of the wicked, admire not the flower of grass: admire not those who are happy only for a
season, but miserable unto eternity.…If ye wish to flourish like a palm-tree, and to spread
abroad like a cedar in Libanus, and not to wither like grass when the sun is hot; as those
who appear to flourish when the sun is absent. If then ye wish not to be as grass, but as the
palm-tree and the cedar, what will ye show forth? “How true the Lord my strength is: and
that there is no unrighteousness in Him.” How is it there is no unrighteousness? A man
committeth so great crimes; he is well, he hath sons, a plentiful house, he is full of pride, is
exalted by his honours, is revenged on his enemies, and doeth every evil deed; another man,
innocent, attending to his own affairs, not robbing another’s goods, doing nothing against
any one, suffereth in chains, in prison, tosseth and sigheth in poverty. How is it that there
is no unrighteousness in Him? Be quiet, and thou shalt know: for thou art disturbed, and
in thy chamber thou dost darken thy light. The eternal God doth wish to shine upon thee:
do not then make thee cloudy weather from thy own disturbed mind. Be quiet within thyself,
and see what I say unto thee. Because God is eternal, because for the present He spareth the
bad, bringing them to repentance: He scourgeth the good, instructing them in the way unto
the kingdom of heaven: “There is no unrighteousness in Him:” fear not.…What, if He
leaveth this man unpunished now, because he is doomed to hear, “Depart into everlasting
fire.” But when? when thou shalt be placed at the right hand, then shall it be said to those
placed on the left, “Depart into the everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his
angels.” Let not therefore those things move thee: Be quiet, keep Sabbath, and show “how
true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no unrighteousness in Him.”
Psalm XCII
Psalm XCIII.4340
1. …It is entitled, “The Song of praise of David himself, on the day before the Sabbath,
when the earth was founded.” Remembering then what God did through all those days,
when He made and ordained all things, from the first up to the sixth day (for the seventh
He sanctified, because He rested on that day after all the works, which He made very good),
we find that He created on the sixth day (which day is here mentioned, in that he saith,
“before the Sabbath”) all animals on the earth; lastly, He on that very day created man in
His own likeness and image. For these days were not without reason ordained in such order,
but for that ages also were to run in a like course, before we rest in God.4341 But then we
rest if we do good works. As a type of this, it is written of God, “God rested on the seventh
day,” when He had made all His works very good.4342 For He was not wearied, so as to need
rest, nor hath He now left off to work, for our Lord Christ saith openly, “My Father worketh
hitherto.”4343 For He saith this unto the Jews, who thought carnally of God, and understood
not that God worketh in quiet, and always worketh, and is always in quiet. We also, then,
whom God willed then to figure in Himself, shall have rest after all good works.…And be-
cause these good works are doomed to pass away, that sixth day also, when those very good
works are perfected, hath an evening; but in the Sabbath we find no evening, because our
rest shall have no end: for evening is put for end. As therefore God made man in His own
image on the sixth day: thus we find that our Lord Jesus Christ came into the sixth age, that
man might be formed anew after the image of God. For the first period, as the first day, was
from Adam until Noah: the second, as the second day, from Noah unto Abraham: the third,
as the third day, from Abraham unto David: the fourth, as the fourth day, from David unto
the removal to Babylon: the fifth period, as the fifth day, from the removal to Babylon unto
the preaching of John. The sixth day beginneth from the preaching of John, and lasteth
unto the end: and after the end of the sixth day, we reach our rest. The sixth day, therefore,
is even now passing.4344 And it is now the sixth day, see what the title hath; “On the day
before the Sabbath, when the earth was founded.” Let us now listen to the Psalm itself: let
us enquire of it, how the earth was made, whether perhaps the earth was then made: and
we do not read so in Genesis. When, therefore, was the earth founded? when, unless when
that which hath been but now read in the Apostle taketh place: “If,” he saith, “ye are stedfast,
immovable.” 4345 When all who believe throughout all the earth are stedfast in faith, the

earth is founded: then man is made in the image of God. That sixth day in Genesis signifieth
this.…
2. “The Lord reigneth, He is clothed with beauty; the Lord is clothed with strength, and
is girded” (ver. 1). We see that He hath clothed Himself with two things: beauty and strength.
But why? That He might found the earth. So it followeth, “He hath made the round world
so sure, that it cannot be moved.” Whence hath He made it so sure? Because He hath clothed
Himself in beauty. He would not make it so sure, if He put on beauty only, and not strength
also. Why therefore beauty, why strength? For He hath said both. Ye know, brethren, that
when our Lord had come in the flesh, of those to whom He preached the Gospel, He pleased
some, and displeased others. For the tongues of the Jews were divided against one another:
“Some said, He is a good Man; others said, Nay, but He deceiveth the people.”4346 Some
then spoke well, others detracted from Him, tore Him, bit and insulted Him. Towards those
therefore whom He pleased, “He put on beauty;” towards those whom He displeased, “He
put on strength.” Imitate then thy Lord, that thou mayest become His garment: be with
beauty towards those whom thy good works please: show thy strength against detractors.…
3. Perhaps we should enquire respecting this word also, why he said, “He is girded.”
Girding signifieth work: for every man then girdeth himself, when he is about to work. But
wherefore did he use the word præcinctus, instead of cinctus? For he saith in another
Psalm,4347 “Gird Thee with Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O Thou most mighty: the people
shall fall under Thee:” using the word accingere, not cingere, nor præcingere: this word being
applied to the act of attaching anything to the side by girding it. The sword of the Lord,
wherewith He conquered the round world by killing iniquity, is the Spirit of God in the
truth of the word of God. Wherefore is He said to bind His sword around His thigh? In
another place, on another Psalm we have spoken in another manner of girding: but never-
theless, since it hath been mentioned, it ought not to be passed over. What is the girding on
of the sword around the thigh? He meaneth the flesh by the thigh. For the Lord would not
otherwise conquer the round world, unless the sword of truth came into the flesh. Why
therefore is He here said to be girded in front (præcinctus)? He who girdeth himself before,
placeth something before himself, wherewith he is girded; whence it is said, He girded
Himself before with a towel, and began to wash the disciples’ feet. Because He was humble
when He girded Himself with a towel. He washed the feet of His own disciples. But all
strength is in humility: because all pride is fragile: therefore when He was speaking of
strength, he added, “He is girded:” that thou mayest remember how thy God was girded in
humility, when He washed His disciples’ feet. 4348…After He had washed their feet, again
4346 John vii. 12.
4347 Ps. xlv. 3.
4348 John xiii. 4–15.
Psalm XCIII
He sat down; He said unto them, “Ye call me Lord and Master: and ye say well; for so I am.
If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; how ought ye also to do to one an-
other’s feet?” If therefore strength is in humility, fear not the proud. The humble are like a
rock: the rock seems to lie downwards: but nevertheless it is firm. What are the proud? Like
smoke: although they are lofty, they vanish. We ought therefore to ascribe our Lord’s being
girded to His humility, according to the mention of the Gospel, that He was girded, that He
might wash His disciples’ feet.
4. …“ For He hath made the round world sure, which cannot be moved.”…What then
is the round world, “which cannot be moved”? This He would not mention specially, if there
were not also a round world that can be moved. There is a round world that shall not be
moved. There is a round world that shall be moved. For the good who are stedfast in the
faith are the round world: that no man may say,4349 they are only in part of it; while the
wicked who abide not in faith, when they have felt any tribulation, are throughout the whole
world. There is therefore a round world movable: there is a world immovable: of which the
Apostle speaketh. Behold, the round world movable. I ask thee, of whom speaketh the
Apostle in these words, “Of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus; who concerning the truth
have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already: and overthrow the faith of some?”4350
Did these belong to the round world, that shall not be moved? But they were chaff: and as
he saith, “they overthrow the faith of some.”…“Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth
sure; having his seal,”—what seal hath it as its sure foundation?—“ The Lord knoweth them
that are His.” This is the round world that shall not be moved; “The Lord knoweth them
that are His.” And what seal hath it? “And let every one that nameth the name of Christ
depart from unrighteousness.” Let him depart from unrighteousness: for he cannot depart
from the unrighteous, for the chaff is mixed with the wheat until it is fanned.…
5. “Thy throne is established from thence, O Lord” (ver. 2). What is, “from thence”?
From that time. As if he said, What is the throne of God? Where doth God sit? In His Saints.
Dost thou wish to be the throne of God? Prepare a place in thy heart where He may sit.
What is the throne of God, except where God dwelleth? Where doth God dwell, except in
His temple? What is His temple? Is it surrounded with walls? Far from it. Perhaps this world
is His temple, because it is very great, and a thing worthy to contain God. It contains not
Him by whom it was made. And wherein is He contained? In the quiet soul, in the righteous
soul: that is it that containeth Him.…He who said, “Before Abraham was, I am:”4351 not
before Abraham only, but before Adam: not only before Adam, but before all the angels,
before heaven and earth; since all things were made through Him: he added, lest thou, at-
4349 As the Donatists.

Psalm XCIII
tending to the day of our Lord’s nativity, mightest think He commenced from that time,
“Thy throne is established, O God.” But what God? “Thou art from everlasting:” for which
he uses ‡π’ αἰῶνος, in the Greek version; that word being sometimes used for an age,
sometimes for everlasting. Therefore, O Thou who seemest to be born “from thence,” Thou
art from everlasting! But let not human birth be thought of, but Divine eternity. He began
then from the time of His birth; He grew:4352 ye have heard the Gospel. He chose disciples,
He replenished them, His disciples began to preach. Perhaps this is what he speaketh of in
the following verse.
6. “The floods lift up their voices” (ver. 3). What are these floods, which have lift up
their voices? We heard them not: neither when our Lord was born, did we hear rivers speak,
nor when He was baptized, nor when He suffered; we heard not that rivers did speak. Read
the Gospel, ye find not that rivers spoke. It is not enough that they spoke: “They have lift
up their voice:” they have not only spoken, but bravely, mightily, in a lofty voice. What are
those rivers which have spoken?…The Spirit itself was a mighty river, whence many rivers
were filled. Of that river the Psalmist saith in another passage, “The rivers of the flood
thereof shall make glad the city of God.”4353 Rivers then were made to flow from the belly
of the disciples, when they received the Holy Spirit: themselves were rivers, when they had
received that Holy Spirit. Whence did those rivers lift their voices? wherefore did they lift
them up? Because at first they feared. Peter was not yet a river, when at the question of the
maid-servant he thrice denied Christ: “I do not know the man.”4354 Here he lieth through
fear: he lifteth not his voice as yet: he is not yet the river. But when they were filled with the
Holy Spirit, the Jews sent for them, and enjoined them not to preach at all, nor to teach in
the name of Jesus.…For when the Apostles had been dismissed from the council of the Jews,
they came to their own friends, and told them what the priests and elders said unto them:
but they on hearing lifted up their voices with one accord unto the Lord, and said, “Lord,
it is Thou who hast made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is;”4355 and
the rest which floods lifting up their voices might say, “Wonderful are the hangings of the
sea” (ver. 4). For when the disciples had lifted up their voices unto Him, many believed, and
many received the Holy Spirit, and many rivers instead of few began to lift up their voice.
Hence there followeth, “from the voices of many waters, wonderful are the hangings of the
sea;” that is, the waves of the world. When Christ had begun to be preached by so powerful
voices, the sea became enraged, persecutions began to thicken. When therefore the rivers
had lift up their voice, “from the voices of many waters, wonderful” were “the hangings of
4352 Luke ii. 40, 52.

Psalm XCIII
the sea.” To be hung aloft is to be lifted up; when the sea rages, the waves are hung as from
above. Let the waves hang over as they choose; let the sea roar as it chooseth; the hangings
of the sea indeed are mighty, mighty are the threatenings, mighty the persecutions; but see
what followeth: “but yet the Lord, who dwelleth on high, is mightier.” Let therefore the sea
restrain itself, and sometime become calmed; let peace be granted by Christians. The sea
was disturbed, the vessel was tossed; the vessel is the Church: the sea, the world. The Lord
came, He walked over the sea, and calmed the waves. How did the Lord walk over the sea?
Above the heads of those mighty foaming waves. Principalities and kings believed; they
were subdued unto Christ. Let us not therefore be frightened; because “the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.”
7. “Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very surely believed” (ver. 5). The Lord, who dwelleth
on high, is mightier than the mighty overhangings of the sea. “Thy testimonies are very
surely believed.” “Thy testimonies,” because He had said beforehand, “These things I have
spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation.”…He
added, “but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”4356 If then He saith, “I have
overcome the world,” cling unto Him who overcame the world, who overcame the sea. Rejoice
in Him, because the Lord, who dwelleth on high, is mightier, and, “Thy testimonies are very
surely believed.” And what is the end of all these? “Holiness becometh Thine house, O Lord!”
Thine house, the whole of Thine house, not here and there: but the whole of Thine house,
throughout the whole world. Why throughout the whole of the round world? “Because He
hath set aright the round world, which cannot be moved.”4357 The Lord’s house will be
strong: it will prevail throughout the whole world: many shall fall: but that house standeth;
many shall be disturbed, but that house shall not be moved. Holiness becometh Thine house,
O Lord!” For a short time only? No. “Unto length of days.”

4357 Ps. xcvi. 10.
Psalm XCIII
Psalm XCIV.4358
1. As we listened with much attention, while the Psalm was in reading, so let us listen
attentively, while the Lord revealeth the mysteries which He hath deigned to obscure in this
passage. For some mysteries in the Scriptures are shut up for this reason, not that they may
be denied, but that they may be opened unto those who knock. If therefore ye knock with
affection of piety, and sincere heartfelt love, He, who seeth from what motives ye knock,
will open unto you.4359 It is known unto all of us (and I wish we may not be among their
number), that may murmur against God’s long-suffering, and grieve either that impious
and wicked men live in this world, or that they have great power; and what is more, that the
bad generally have great power against the good, and that the bad often oppress the good;
that the wicked exult, while the good suffer; the evil are proud, while the good are humbled.
Observing such things in the human race (for they abound), impatient and weak minds are
perverted, as if they were good in vain; since God averteth, or seemeth to avert, His eyes
from the good works of the pious and faithful, and to promote the wicked in those pleasures
which they love. Weak men, therefore, imagining that they live well in vain, are induced
either to imitate the wickedness of those whom they see flourishing: or if either through
bodily or mental weakness they are deterred from doing wrong by a fear of the penal laws
of the world; not because they love justice, but, to speak more openly, fearing the condem-
nation of men among men, they refrain indeed from wicked deeds, but refrain not from
wicked thoughts. And among their wicked thoughts, the chief is the wickedness which
leadeth them impiously to imagine that God is neglectful, and regardless of human affairs:
and that He either holdeth in equal estimation the good and the wicked: or even, and this
is a still more pernicious notion, that He persecuteth the good, and favoureth the wicked.
He who thinketh thus, although he doth no harm to any man, doth the greatest to himself,
and is impious against himself, and by his wickedness hurteth not God, but slayeth himself.…
2. The Psalm hath this title, that is, this inscription: “A Psalm of David himself, on the
fourth day of the week.” This Psalm is about to teach patience in the sufferings of the
righteous: it enjoineth patience against the prosperity of the wicked, and buildeth up patience.
This is the drift of the whole of it, from beginning to end. Wherefore then hath it such a
title, “on the fourth of the week”? The first of the week is the Lord’s day: the second, is the
second week-day, which people of the world call the Moon’s day: the third, is the third
weekday, which they term Mars’ day. The fourth of the Sabbaths therefore is the fourth
week-day, which by Pagans is styled Mercury’s day, and also by many Christians; but I would
not call it so: and I wish they would change for the better, and cease to do so; for they have

conclusion.
4359 Matt. vii. 7.
Psalm XCIV
Psalm XCIV
a phrase of their own, which they may use. For these terms are not of universal use: many
nations have severally different names for them: so that the mode of speech used by the
Church better beseemeth the mouth of a Christian.4360 Yet if custom hath induced any
person to utter that with his tongue which his heart doth disapprove, let him remember,
that all those whose names the stars bear were men, and that the stars did not commence
their existence in the sky, when those men began theirs, but were there long before; but on
account of some mortal services rendered unto mortals, those men in their own times, be-
cause they had great power, and were eminent in this life, since they were beloved by men,
not on account of eternal life, but of temporal services, received divine honours. For then
men of the old world, in being deceived and wishing to deceive, pointed to the stars in
heaven, to flatter those who had done them any good service in their affection for this life,
saying, that that was the star of such a man, this of another; while the man who had not
beheld them before, so as to see that those stars were there before the birth of the man, were
deceived into a belief: and thus this vain opinion was conceived. This erroneous opinion
the devil strengthened, Christ overthrew. According to our mode of speech, then, the fourth
of the week is taken for the fourth day from the Lord’s day. Attend, therefore, beloved, to
what this title meaneth. Here is a great mystery, and a truly hidden one.…Let us therefore
recall from the holy Scripture in Genesis, what was created on the first day; we find light:
what was created on the second day; we find the firmament, which God called heaven: what
was created on the third day; we find the form of earth and sea, and their separation, that
all the gathering together of the waters was called sea, and all that was dry, the earth. On
the fourth day, the Lord made the lights in heaven:4361 “The sun to rule the day: the moon
and stars to govern the night:”4362 this was the work of the fourth day. What then is the
reason that the Psalm hath taken its title from the fourth day: the Psalm in which patience
is enjoined against the prosperity of the wicked, and the sufferings of the good. Thou findest
the Apostle Paul speaking. “Do all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye may
be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of
life.”4363…
3. Let us now attend to the Psalm. “The Lord is the God of vengeance; the God of ven-
geance hath dealt confidently” (ver. 1). Dost thou think that He doth not punish? “The God
of vengeance” punisheth. What is, “The God of vengeance”? The God of punishments. Thou
murmurest surely because the bad are not punished: yet do not murmur, lest thou be among
4360 [“The first day of the week,” etc.—C.]
4361 Gen. i. 3–19.
4362 Ps. cxxxvi. 8, 9.
4363 Philip. ii. 14–16.
Psalm XCIV
those who are punished. That man hath committed a theft, and liveth: thou murmurest
against God, because he who committed a theft on thee dieth not.…Therefore, if thou
wouldest have another correct his hand, do thou first correct thy tongue: thou wouldest
have him correct his heart towards man, correct thy heart towards God; lest perchance,
when thou desirest the vengeance of God, if it come, it find thee first. For He will come: He
will come, and will judge those who continue in their wickedness, ungrateful for the pro-
longation of His mercy, for His long-suffering, treasuring up unto themselves wrath against
the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every
man according to his deeds:4364 because, “The Lord is the God of vengeance,” therefore
hath He “dealt confidently.”…Our safety is our Saviour: in Him He would place the hope
of all the needy and poor. And what saith He? “I will deal confidently in Him.” What meaneth
this? He will not fear, will not spare the lusts and vices of men. Truly, as a faithful physician,
with the healing knife of preaching in His hand, He hath cut away all our wounded parts.
Therefore such as He was prophesied and preached beforehand, such was He found.…How
great things then did He, of whom it is said, “He taught them as one having authority,” say
unto them? “Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!”4365 What great things did
He say unto them, before their face? He feared no one. Why? Because He is the God of
vengeance. For this reason He spared them not in words, that they might remain for Him
after to spare them in judgment; because if they were unwilling to accept the healing of His
word, they would afterwards incur their Judge’s doom. Wherefore? Because He hath said,
“The Lord is the God of vengeance, the God of vengeance hath dealt confidently;” that is,
He hath spared no man in word. He who spared not in word when about to suffer, will He
spare in judgment when about to judge? He who in His humility feared no man, will He
fear any man in His glory? From His dealing thus confidently in time past, imagine how He
will deal at the end of time. Murmur not then against God, who seemeth to spare the wicked;
but be thou good, and perhaps for a season He may not spare thee the rod, that He may in
the end spare thee in judgment.…
4. And what followed, because He dealt confidently? “Be exalted, Thou Judge of the
world” (ver. 2). Because they imprisoned Him when humble, thinkest thou they will imprison
Him when exalted? Because they judged Him when mortal, will they not be judged by Him
when immortal? What then saith He? “Be exalted,” Thou, who hast dealt confidently, the
confidence of whose word the wicked bore not, but thought they did a glorious deed, when
they seized and crucified Thee; they who ought to have seized on Thee with faith, seized
Thee with persecution. Thou then who hast among the wicked dealt confidently, and hast
feared no man, because Thou hast suffered, “be exalted;” that is, arise again, depart into
4364 Rom. ii. 4–6.
4365 Matt. xxiii. 13, 16.
Psalm XCIV
heaven. Let the Church also bear with long-suffering what the Church’s Head hath borne
with long-suffering. “Be exalted, Thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their
deserving.” He will reward them, brethren. For what is this, “Be exalted, Thou Judge of the
world: and reward the proud after their deserving”? This is the prophecy of one who doth
predict, not the boldness of one who commandeth. Not because the Prophet said, “Be exalted,
Thou Judge of the world,” did Christ obey the Prophet, in arising from the dead, and ascend-
ing into heaven; but because Christ was to do this, the Prophet predicted it. He seeth Christ
abased in the spirit, abased he seeth Him: fearing no man, in speech sparing no man, and
he saith, “He hath dealt confidently.” He seeth how confidently He hath dealt, he seeth Him
arrested, crucified, humbled, he seeth Him rising from the dead, and ascending into heaven,
and from thence to come in judgment of those, among whose hands He had suffered every
evil: “Be exalted,” he saith, “Thou Judge of the world, and reward the proud after their de-
serving.” The proud He will thus reward, not the humble. Who are the proud? Those to
whom it is little to do evil: but they even defend their own sins. For on some of those who
crucified Christ, miracles were afterwards performed, when out of the number of the Jews
themselves there were found believers, and the blood of Christ was given unto them. Their
hands were impious, and red with the blood of Christ. He whose blood they had shed,
Himself washed them. They who had persecuted His mortal body which they had seen, be-
came part of His very body, that is, the Church. They shed their own ransom, that they
might drink their own ransom. For afterwards more were converted.…
5. “Lord, how long shall the ungodly, how long shall the ungodly triumph?” (ver. 3).
“They answer, and will speak wickedness, they all will speak that work unrighteousness”
(ver. 4). What is their saying, but against God, when they say: What profiteth it us that we
live thus? What wilt thou reply? Doth God truly regard our deeds? For because they live,
they imagine that God knoweth not their actions. Behold, what evil happeneth unto them!
If the officers4366 knew where they were, they would arrest them; and they therefore avoid
the officer’s eyes, that they may escape instant apprehension; but no one can escape the eye
of God, since He not only seeth within the closet, but within the recesses of the heart. Even
they themselves believe that nothing can escape God: and because they do evil, and are
conscious of what they have done, and see that they live while God knoweth, though they
would not live if the officer discovered them; they say unto themselves, These things please
God: and, in truth, if they displeased Him, as they displease kings, as they displease judges,
as they displease governors, as they displease recorders,4367 yet could we escape the eye of
4366 Stationarius. Soldiers, and officers of the governors, stationed in certain places through the provinces
and cities, who gave information to the magistrates of notorious offences. Ex l. 1, c. De Curios. et Stationar. libro

God, as we do escape the eyes of those authorities? Therefore these things please God.…Some
righteous man cometh, and saith, Do not commit iniquity. Wherefore? That thou mayest
not die. Behold, iniquity I have committed: why do I not die? That man wrought righteous-
ness: and he is dead: why is he dead? I have wrought iniquity: why hath not God carried me
off? Behold, that man did righteously: and why hath He thus visited him? why suffereth He
thus? They answer; this is the meaning of the word “answer:” for they have a reply to make;
because they are spared, from the long-suffering of God, they discover an argument for their
reply. He spareth them for one reason, they answer for another, because they still live. For
the Apostle telleth us wherefore He spareth, he expoundeth the grounds of the long-suffering
of God: “And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest
the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? Or despisest thou the riches of His
goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the long-suffering of God
leadeth thee to repentance?” “But thou,” that is, he who answereth and saith, If I displeased
God, He would not spare me, hear what he worketh for himself; hear the Apostle; “but after
thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up into thyself wrath against the day of wrath,
and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according
to his deeds.”4368 He therefore increaseth His long-suffering, thou increasest thine iniquity.
His treasure will consist in eternal mercy towards those who have not despised His mercy;
but thy treasure will be discovered in wrath, and what thou daily layest up by little and little,
thou wilt find in the accumulated mass; thou layest up by the grain, but thou wilt find the
whole heap. Omit not to watch thy slightest daily sins: rivers are filled from the smallest
drops.
6. …“They have humbled Thy people, O Lord; and have troubled Thine heritage” (ver.
5). “They have murdered the widow, and the fatherless: and slain the proselyte” (ver. 6);
that is, the traveller, the pilgrim: the comer from far, as the Psalmist calleth himself. Each
of these expressions is too clear in meaning to make it worth while to dwell upon them.
7. “And they have said, The Lord shall not see” (ver. 7): He observeth not, regardeth
not these things: He careth for other matters, He understandeth not. These are the two as-
sertions of the wicked: one which I have just quoted, “These things hast thou done, and I
held my tongue, and thou thoughtest unrighteousness, that I will be like thyself.” What
meaneth, “that I will be like thyself”? Thou thinkest that I see thy deeds, and that they are
pleasing unto Me, because I do not punish them. There is another assertion of the wicked:
because God neither regardeth these things, nor observeth that He may know how I live,
God heedeth me not. Doth then God make any reckoning of me? or doth He even take ac-
count of me? or of men in general? Unhappy man! He cared for thee, that thou mightest
4368 Rom. ii. 5, 6.
Psalm XCIV
exist: doth He not care that thou live well? Such then are the words of these last; “and yet
they have said, The Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.”
8. “Take heed now, ye that are unwise among the people: O ye fools, some time under-
stand!” (ver. 8). He teacheth His people whose feet might slip: any one among them seeth
the prosperity of the wicked, himself living well among the Saints of God, that is, among
the number of the sons of the Church: he seeth that the wicked flourish, and work iniquity,
he envieth, and is led to follow them in their actions; because he seeth that apparently it
profiteth him nothing that he liveth well in humility, hoping for his reward here. For if he
hopeth for it in future, he loseth it not; because the time is not yet come for him to receive
it. Thou art working in a vineyard: execute thy task, and thou shalt receive thy pay. Thou
wouldest not exact it from thy employer, before thy work was finished, and yet dost thou
exact it from God before thou dost work? This patience is part of thy work, and thy pay
dependeth upon thy work: thou who dost not choose to be patient, choosest to work less
upon the vineyard: since this act of patience belongeth to thy labouring itself, which is to
gain thy pay. But if thou art treacherous, take care, lest thou shouldest not only not receive
thy pay, but also suffer punishment, because thou hast chosen to be a treacherous labourer.
When such a labourer beginneth to do ill, he watcheth his employer’s eyes, who hired him
for his vineyard, that he may loiter when his eye is turned away; but the moment his eyes
are turned towards him, he worketh diligently. But God, who hired thee, averteth not His
eyes: thou canst not work treacherously: the eyes of thy Master are ever upon thee: seek an
opportunity to deceive Him, and loiter if thou canst. If then any of you had any such ideas,
when ye saw the wicked flourishing, and if such thoughts caused your feet to slip in the path
of God; to you this Psalm speaketh: but if perchance none of you be such, through you it
doth address others, in these words, “Take heed now;” since they had said, “The Lord shall
not see: neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.” “Take heed,” it saith, “now, ye that are
unwise among the people: and ye fools, some time understand!”4369
9. “He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? or He that made the eye, doth He not
consider?” (ver. 9) “or He that instructeth the nations, shall He not reprove?” (ver. 10). This
is what God is at present doing: He is instructing the nations: for this reason he sent His
word to man throughout the world: He sent it by Angels, by Patriarchs, by Prophets, by
servants, through so many heralds going before the Judge. He sent also His own Word
Himself, He sent His own Son in Person: He sent the servants of His Son, and in these very
servants His own Son. Throughout the world is everywhere preached the word of God.
Where is it not said unto men, Abandon your former wickedness, and turn yourselves to
right paths? He spareth, that ye may correct yourselves: He punished not yesterday, in order
4369 [On Plutarch’s “Delays of the Divine Justice,” see the valuable translation of De Maistre, with that of
Amyot, Paris, 1853.—C.]
Psalm XCIV
that to-day ye may live well. He teacheth the heathen, shall He not therefore reprove? will
He not hear those whom He teacheth? will He not judge those to whom He hath beforehand
sent and sown lessons of warning? If thou wast in a school, wouldest thou receive a task,
and not repeat it? When therefore thou receivest it from thy master, thou art being taught:
the Master giveth thy task into thy hands, and shall He not exact it from thee when thou
comest to repeat it? or when thou hast begun to repeat it, shalt thou not be in fear of stripes?
At present then we are receiving our work: afterwards we are placed before the Master, that
we may give up to Him all our past tasks, that is, that we may give an account of all those
things which are now being bestowed upon us. Hear the Apostle’s words: “We must all appear
before the judgment-seat of Christ,” etc.4370 “It is He that teacheth man knowledge.” Doth
He not know, who maketh thee to know?
10. “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are but vain” (ver. 11). For al-
though thou knowest not the thoughts of God, that they are righteous; “He knoweth the
thoughts of man, that they are but vain.” Even men have known the thoughts of God: but
those to whom He hath become a friend, it is to them He showeth His counsel. Do not,
brethren, despise yourselves: if ye approach the Lord with faith, ye hear the thoughts of God;
these ye are now learning, this is told you, and for this reason ye are taught, why God spareth
the wicked in this life, that ye may not murmur against God, who teacheth man knowledge.
“The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are but vain.” Abandon therefore the
thoughts of man, which are vain: that ye may take hold on the thoughts of God, which are
wise. But who is he who taketh hold on the thoughts of God? He who is placed in the firm-
ament of heaven. We have already chanted that Psalm, and have expounded this expression
therein.
11. “Blessed is the man whom Thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him from Thy
law” (ver. 12). Behold, thou hast the counsel of God, wherefore He spareth the wicked: the
pit is being digged for the sinner. Thou wishest to bury him at once: the pit is as yet being
dug for him: do not be in haste to bury him. What mean the words, “until the pit be digged
up for the sinner”? or whom doth He mean by sinner? One man? No. Whom then? The
whole race of such that are sinners? No; them that are proud; for he had said before, “Reward
the proud after their deserving.” For that publican, who would not so much as lift up his
eyes to heaven, but “smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner,”4371
was a sinner; but since he was not proud, and since God will render a recompense to the
proud; the pit is being dug not for him, but for them that are such, until He render a recom-
pense to the proud. In the words then, “until the pit be digged up for the ungodly,” under-
stand the proud. Who is the proud? He who doth not by confession of his sins do penance,
4370 2 Cor. v. 10 and Rom. xiv. 10.
4371 Luke xviii. 13.
Psalm XCIV
that he may be healed through his humility. Who is the proud? He who chooseth to arrogate
to himself those few good things which he seemeth to possess, and who doth detract from
the mercy of God. Who is the proud? He who although he doth ascribe unto God his good
works, yet insulteth those who do not those good works, and raiseth himself above
them.…This then is the Christian doctrine: no man doeth anything well except by His grace.
A man’s bad acts are his own: his good he doth of God’s bounty. When he hath begun to
do well, let not him ascribe it unto himself: when he hath not attributed it to himself, let
him give thanks to Him from whom he hath received it. But when he doeth well, let him
not insult him who doth not as he doth nor exalt himself above him: for the grace of God
is not stayed at him, so that it cannot reach another.
12. “That Thou mayest give him patience in days of malice: until the pit be digged up
for the ungodly” (ver. 13). Have patience therefore every one, if thou art a Christian, in time
of malice. Days of malice are those in which the ungodly appear to flourish, and the righteous
to suffer; but the suffering of the righteous is the rod of the Father, and the prosperity of the
ungodly is their own snare. For because God giveth you patience in time of adversity, until
the pit be digged up for the ungodly, do not think that the Angels are standing in some place
with mattocks, and are digging that great pit which shall be able to contain the whole race
of the ungodly; and because ye see that the wicked are many, and say unto yourselves carnally:
Truly what pit can contain so great a multitude of the wicked, such a crowd of sinners?
where is a pit of such dimensions, as to contain all, dug? when finished? therefore God
spareth them. This is not so: their very prosperity is the pit of the wicked: for into that shall
they fall, as it were into a pitfall. Attend, brethren, for it is a great thing to know that
prosperity is called a pitfall: “until the pit be digged up for the ungodly.” For God spareth
him whom He knoweth to be ungodly and impious, in His own hidden justice: and this
very sparing of God, causeth him to be puffed up through his impunity.…The proud man
raiseth himself up against God: God sinketh him: and he sinketh by the very act of raising
himself up against God. For in another Psalm4372 he thus saith, “Thou hast cast them down,
while they were being exalted.” He said not, Thou hast cast them down, because they were
exalted; or, Thou hast cast them down, after they were exalted; so that the period of their
exaltation be one, of their casting down another: but in the very act of their exaltation were
they cast down. For in proportion as the heart of man is proud, so doth it recede from God;
and if it recede from God, it sinketh down into the deep. On the other hand, the humble
heart bringeth God unto it from heaven, so that He becometh very near unto it. Surely God
is lofty, God is above all the heavens, He surpasseth all the Angels: how high must these be
4372 Ps. lxxii. 18.
Psalm XCIV
raised, to reach that exalted One? Do not burst thyself by enlarging thyself; I give thee other
advice, lest perchance in enlarging thyself thou burst, through pride: surely God is lofty: do
thou humble thyself, and He will descend unto thee.
13. …Do thou rejoice beneath the scourge: because the heritage is kept for thee, “for
the Lord will not cast off His people” (ver. 14). He chasteneth for a season, He condemneth
not for ever: the others He spareth for a season, and will condemn them for evermore. Make
thy choice: dost thou wish temporary suffering, or eternal punishment? temporal happiness,
or eternal life? What doth God threaten? Eternal punishment. What doth He promise?
Eternal rest. His scourging the good, is temporary: His sparing the wicked, is also temporary.
“Neither will He forsake His inheritance.”
14. “Until righteousness,” he saith, “turn again unto judgment, and all they that have it
are right in heart” (ver. 15). Listen now, and gain righteousness: for judgment thou canst
not yet have. Thou shouldest gain righteousness first; but that very righteousness of thine
shall turn unto judgment. The Apostles had righteousness here on earth, and bore with the
wicked. But what is said unto them? “Ye shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel.”4373 Their righteousness therefore shall turn unto judgment. For whoever is
righteous in this life, is so for this reason, that he may endure evils with patience: let him
suffer patiently the period of suffering, and the day of judging cometh. But why do I speak
of the servants of God? The Lord Himself, who is the Judge of all living and dead, first chose
to be judged, and then to judge. Those who have righteousness at present, are not yet judges.
For the first thing is to have righteousness, and afterwards to judge: He first endureth the
wicked, and afterwards judgeth them. Let there be righteousness now: afterwards it shall
turn again unto judgment. And so long He endureth wicked men, as God doth will, as long
as God’s Church shall endure them, that she may be taught through their wickedness.
Nevertheless, God will not cast off His people, “all such as have it are right in heart.” Who
are those who are right in heart? Those whose will is the will of God. He spareth sinners:
thou dost wish Him at once to destroy sinners. Thy heart is crooked and thy will perverted,
when thy will is one way and the will of God another. God wisheth to spare sinners: thou
dost not wish sinners spared. God is of long-suffering to sinners: thou dost not wish to endure
sinners.…Wish not to bend the will of God to thy will, but rather correct thy will to His.
The will of God is like a rule: behold, suppose, thou hast twisted the rule: whence canst thou
be set straight? But the rule itself continueth straight: for it is immutable. As long as the rule
is straight, thou hast whither to turn thyself, and straighten thy perversity; thou hast a means
of correcting what is crooked in thee. But what do men will? It is not enough that their own
will is crooked; they even wish to make the will of God crooked according to their own
4373 Matt. xix. 28.
Psalm XCIV
heart, that God may do what they themselves will, when they ought to do that which God
willeth.…
15. “Who will rise up for me against the wicked? or who will take my part against the
evil doers?” (ver. 16). Many persuade us to divers evils: the serpent ceaseth not to whisper
to thee to work iniquity: whichever way thou shalt turn, if perchance thou hast done well,
thou seekest to live well with some one, and thou hardly findest any one; many wicked men
surround thee, for there are few grains of wheat, and much chaff. This floor hath its grains
of corn, but as yet they suffer. Therefore the whole mass of the wheat, when separated from
the chaff, will be great: the grains are few, but when compared with the chaff, still many in
themselves. When therefore the wicked cry out on every side, and say, Why livest thou thus?
Art thou the only Christian? Why dost thou not do what others also do? Why dost thou not
frequent the theatres, as others do? Why dost thou not use charms and amulets? Why dost
thou not consult astrologers and soothsayers, even as others do? And thou crossest4374
thyself, and sayest, I am Christian, that thou mayest repel them, whosoever they are; but
the enemy presses on, urges his attacks; what is worse, by the example of Christians he
choketh Christians. They toil on, in the midst of heat: the Christian soul suffereth tribulation:
yet it hath power to conquer: hath it such power of itself? For this reason remark what he
saith. For he answereth, What doth it profit me that I now find charms for myself, and gain
a few days? I depart hence from this life, and repair unto my Lord, who shall send me into
the flames; because I have preferred a few days to life eternal, He shall send me into hell.
What hell? That of the eternal judgment of God. Is it really so (the enemy answereth), unless
indeed thou really believest that God careth how men live? And perhaps it is not an acquaint-
ance who speaketh thus to thee in the street, but thy wife at home, or possibly the husband
to the faithful and holy wife, her deceiver. If it be the woman to her husband, she is as Eve
unto him; if as the husband unto the wife, he is as the devil unto her: either she is herself as
Eve unto thee, or thou art a serpent unto her. Sometimes the father would incline his thoughts
to his son, and findeth him wicked, utterly depraved: he is in a fever of misery, he wavers,
he seeketh how to subdue him, he is almost drawn in, and consenteth: but may God be4375
near him.…
16. “If the Lord,” he saith, “had not helped me: within a little my soul had dwelt in hell”
(ver. 17). I had almost plunged into that pit which is preparing for sinners: that is, my soul
had dwelt in hell. Because he already began to waver, and nearly to consent, he looked back
unto the Lord. Suppose, for example’s sake, he was insulted to tempt him to iniquity. For
sometimes the wicked flock together, and insult the good; especially if they are more in
number, and if they have taken him alone, as there is often much chaff about one grain of
4374 Et tu signas te.
4375 Al. “God is.”
Psalm XCIV
wheat (though there will not be when the heap hath been fanned); he is then taken among
many wicked ones, is insulted, and surrounded; they wish to place themselves over him,
they torment him and insult him for his very righteousness. A great Apostle! say they; Thou
hast flown into heaven, as Elias did! Men do these things, so that sometime, when he
listeneth to the tongue of men, he is ashamed to be good among the wicked. Let him therefore
resist the evil; but not of his own strength, lest he become proud, and when he wishes to
escape the proud, himself increase their number.…
17. “If I said, My foot hath slipt; Thy mercy, O Lord, held me up” (ver. 18). See how
God loveth confession. Thy foot hath slipt, and thou sayest not, my foot hath slipt; but thou
sayest thou art firm, when thou art slipping. The moment thou beginnest to slip or waver,
confess thou that slip, that thou mayest not bewail thy total fall; that He may help, so that
thy soul be not in hell. God loveth confession, loveth humility. Thou hast slipped, as a man;
God helpeth thee, nevertheless: yet say, “My foot hath slipt.” Why dost thou slip, and yet
sayest, I am firm? “When I said, My foot hath slipt, Thy mercy, O Lord, hath held me up.”
Just as Peter presumed, but not in strength of his own. The Lord was seen to walk upon the
sea, trampling on the heads of all the proud in this life. In walking upon the foaming waves,
He figured His own course when He trampleth on the heads of the proud. The Church too
doth trample upon them: for Peter is the Church Herself. Nevertheless, Peter dared not by
himself walk upon the waters; but what said he? “Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto
Thee on the water.”4376 He in His own power, Peter by His order; “bid me,” he saith, “come
unto Thee.” He answered, “Come.” For the Church also trampleth on the heads of the proud;
but since it is the Church, and hath human weakness, that these words might be fulfilled,
“If I said, My foot hath slipt,” Peter tottered on the sea, and cried out, “Lord, save me!”4377
and so what is here put, “If I said, My foot hath slipt,” is put there, “Lord, I perish.” And
what is here, “Thy mercy, O Lord, hath held me up,” is there put, “And immediately Jesus
stretched forth His hand, saying, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?”4378 It
is wonderful how God proveth men: our very dangers render Him who rescueth us sweeter
unto us. For see what followeth: because he said, “If I said, My foot hath slipt, Thy mercy,
O Lord, hath held me up.” The Lord hath become especially sweet unto him, in rescuing
him from danger; and thus speaking of this very sweetness of the Lord, he exclaimeth and
saith, “O Lord, in the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, Thy comforts have
refreshed my soul” (ver. 19). Many sorrows, but many consolations: bitter wounds, and
sweet remedies.

Psalm XCIV
18. “Wilt Thou have anything to do with the stool of iniquity, who makest sorrow in
learning?” (ver. 20). He hath said this, No wicked man sitteth with Thee, nor shalt Thou
have anything to do with the stool of iniquity. And he giveth an account whereof he under-
standeth this, “For Thou makest sorrow in learning.” For from this, because Thou hast not
spared us, do I understand that Thou hast nothing to do with the stool of iniquity. Thou
hast this in the Epistle of the Apostle Peter, and for this reason he hath adduced a testimony
from the Scripture: “for the time is come,” he saith, “that judgment must begin at the house
of God;” that is, the time is come for the judgment of those who belong to the house of God.
If sons are scourged, what must the most wicked slaves expect? For which reason he added:
“And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God?”
To which he added this testimony: “For if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
ungodly and sinner appear?”4379 How then shall the wicked be with Thee, if Thou dost not
even spare Thy faithful, in order that Thou mayest exercise and teach them?4380 But as He
spareth them not, for this reason, that He may teach them: he saith, “For Thou makest sorrow
in learning.” “Makest,” that is, formest: from whence comes the word figulus (from fingo),
and a potter’s vessel is called fictile: not in the meaning of fiction, a falsehood, but of forming
so as to give anything being and some sort of form; as before he said, “He that fabricated
(finxit) the eye, shall He not see?” 4381 Is that, “fabricated the eye” a falsehood? Nay, it is
understood He fashioned the eye, made the eye. And is He not a potter when He makes
men frail, weak, earthly? Hear the Apostle: “We have this treasure in earthen vessels.”4382…Be-
hold our Lord Himself, how He showeth Himself a potter.4383 Because He had made man
of clay, He anointed him with clay, for whom He had not made eyes in the womb. And so
when he saith, “Hast Thou anything to do,” etc., he saith, out of grief makest learning for
us, so that grief itself becomes our instruction. How is sorrow our learning? When He
scourgeth thee who died for thee, and who doth not promise bliss in this life, and who cannot
deceive, and when He giveth not here what thou seekest. What will He give? when will He
give? how much will He give, who giveth not here, who here teacheth, who maketh sorrow
in learning? Thy labour is here, and rest is promised thee. Thou takest thought that thou
hast toil here: but take thought what sort of rest He promiseth. Canst thou conceive it? If
thou couldest, thou wouldest see that thy toil here is nothing toward an equivalent.…
19. Attend, brethren; it is for sale.4384 What I have is for sale, saith God unto thee, buy
it. What hath He for sale? I have rest for sale; buy it by thy toil. Attend, that we may be in

Psalm XCIV
Christ’s name brave Christians: the remainder of the Psalm is but a little, let us not be weary.
For how can he be strong in doing, who faileth in hearing? The Lord will help us to expound
unto you the remainder. Attend then: God hath, as it were, proclaimed the kingdom of
heaven for sale. Thou sayest unto Him, What is its value? The price is toil: if He were to say,
its price is gold, it would not suffice to say this only, but thou wouldest seek to know how
much gold; for there is a mass of gold, and half an ounce, and a pound, and the like. He said
“price,” that thou mightest not be at pains to inquire, how long thou shouldest find it. The
price of the commodity is toil: how much toil is it? Now seek how much thou shouldest toil
for it. Thou art not as yet told how great that toil is doomed to be, or how much toil is re-
quired of thee: God saith this unto thee, I show thee how great that rest will be; do thou
judge with what measure of toil it should be bought.
20. …He promised rest: suffer trouble. He threateneth eternal fire; despise temporal
pains: and while Christ doth watch, let thy heart be calmed, that thou also mayest reach the
harbour. For He would not fail to prepare a harbour, who provided a vessel. “Hast Thou
anything to do with the stool of iniquity, Thou who makest sorrow in learning?” He trieth
us with the wicked, and by their persecution He teacheth us. By means of the malice of the
wicked the good is scourged, through the slave the son is chastened: thus is learning taught
by sorrow. What God alloweth them power to do, that do wicked men, whom He spareth
for a season, do.
21. For what followeth? “They will be captious against the soul of the righteous” (ver.
21). Why will they be captious? Because they can find no true ground of accusation. For
how were they captious against our Lord? They made up false accusations,4385 because they
could not find true ones. “And will condemn the innocent blood.” Why all this taketh place,
he will show in the sequel.
22. “And the Lord is become my refuge” (ver. 22), he saith. Thou wouldest not seek
such a refuge, if thou wert not in danger: but thou hast therefore been in danger, that thou
mightest seek for it: for He teacheth us by sorrow. He causeth me tribulation from the malice
of the wicked: pricked with that tribulation, I begin to seek a refuge which I had ceased to
seek for in that worldly prosperity. For who, that is always prosperous, and rejoiceth in
present hopes, findeth it easy to remember God? Let the hope of this life give way, and the
hope of God advance; that thou mayest say, “And the Lord is become my refuge:” may I
sorrow for this end that the Lord may become my refuge! “And my God the help of my
hope.” For as yet the Lord is our hope, since as long as we are here, we are in hope, and not
in possession. But lest we fail in hope, there is near us a provision to encourage us, and to
mitigate those very evils which we suffer. For it is not said in vain, “God is faithful, who will
not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able: but will with the temptation also make
4385 Matt. xxvi. 59.
Psalm XCIV
a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it:”4386 who will so put us into that furnace of
tribulation, that the vessel may be hardened, but not broken. “And the Lord is become my
refuge: and my God the help of my hope.” Why then did He seem to thee to be as it were
unjust, in that He spareth the evil? See then how the Psalm is now set right, and be thou set
right together with the Psalm: for, for this reason the Psalm contained thy words. What
words? “Lord, how long shall the ungodly, how long shall the ungodly triumph?”4387 The
Psalm just now used thy words: use therefore thyself the Psalm’s words in thy turn.
23. “And the Lord shall recompense them according to their works, and after their own
malice; the Lord our God shall destroy them” (ver. 23). The words, “after their own malice,”
are not said without meaning. I am benefited through them: and yet it is said to be their
malice, and not their benefits. For assuredly He trieth us, scourgeth us, by means of the
wicked. To prepare us for what doth He scourge us? Confessedly for the kingdom of heaven.
“For He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth; for what son is he whom the father
chasteneth not?”4388 and when God doth this, He is teaching us in order to an eternal her-
itage: and this learning He often giveth us by means of wicked men, through whom He trieth
and perfecteth our love, which He doth will to be extended even to our enemies.4389…Thus
also they who persecuted the Martyrs, by persecuting them on earth, sent them into heaven:
knowingly they caused them the loss of the present life, while unconsciously they were be-
stowing upon them the gain of a future life: but, nevertheless, unto all who persevered in
their wicked hatred of the righteous, will God recompense after their own iniquities, and
in their own malice will He destroy them. For as the goodness of the righteous is hurtful
unto the wicked, so is the iniquity of the wicked beneficial unto the righteous.…
24. Let therefore the righteous bear with the ungodly; let the temporal suffering of the
righteous bear with the temporal impunity of the wicked; for “the just shall live by faith.”4390
For there is no righteousness of man in this life except to live by faith, “which worketh by
love.”4391 But if he liveth by faith, let him believe both that he will himself inherit rest after
his present toil, and that they will suffer eternal torments after their present exultation. And
if faith worketh by love, let him love his enemies also, and, as far as in him lies, have the will
to profit them; for thus he will prevent their injuring him when they have the will. And
whenever perchance they have received power to hurt and tyrannize; let him lift his heart
above, where no man hurteth him, well taught and chastened in the law of God, that he may

25. This I say, brethren, that ye may profit from what ye have heard, and ruminate
within yourselves: permit not yourselves to forget, not only by thinking over again upon
these subjects, and discoursing upon them, but also by so living. For a good life which is led
after God’s commands, is like a pen, because it is heard writing in our hearts. If it were
written on wax, it would easily be blotted out: write it in your hearts, in your character, and
it shall never be blotted out.
Psalm XCIV
Psalm XCV.4392
1. I could wish, brethren, that we were rather listening to our father: but even this is a
good thing, to obey our father. Since therefore he who deigneth to pray for us, hath ordered
us, I will speak unto you, beloved, what from the present Psalm Jesus Christ our common
Lord shall deign to give us. Now the title of the Psalm is “David’s Song of praise.” The “Song
of praise” signifieth both cheerfulness, in that it is a song; and devotion, for it is praise. For
what ought a man to praise more than that which pleaseth him so, that it is impossible that
it can displease him? In the praising of God therefore we praise with security. There he who
praiseth is safe, where he feareth not lest he be ashamed for the object of his praise. Let us
therefore both praise and sing; that is, let us praise with cheerfulness and joy. But what we
are about to praise, this Psalm in the following verses showeth us.
2. “O come, let us sing unto the Lord” (ver. 1). He calleth us to a great banquet of joy,
not one of this world, but in the Lord. For if there were not in this life a wicked joy which
is to be distinguished from a righteous joy, it would be enough to say, “Come, let us rejoice;”
but he has briefly distinguished it. What is it to rejoice aright? To rejoice in the Lord. Thou
shouldest piously joy in the Lord, if thou dost wish safely to trample upon the world. But
what is the word, “Come”? Whence doth He call them to come, with whom he wisheth to
rejoice in the Lord; except that, while they are afar, they may by coming draw nearer, by
drawing nearer they may approach, and by approaching rejoice? But whence are they afar?
Can a man be locally distant from Him who is everywhere?…It is not by place, but by being
unlike Him, that a man is afar from God. What is to be unlike Him? it meaneth, a bad life,
bad habits; for if by good habits we approach God, by bad habits we recede from God.…If
therefore by unlikeness we recede from God, by likeness we approach unto God. What
likeness? That after which we were created, which by sinning we had corrupted in ourselves,
which we have received again through the remission of sins, which is renewed in us in the
mind within, that it may be engraved a second time as if on coin, that is, the image of our
God upon our soul, and that we may return to His treasures.…
3. “Let us make a joyful4393 noise unto God, our salvation.”…Consider, beloved, those
who make a joyful noise in any ordinary songs, as in a sort of competition of worldly joy;
and ye see them while reciting the written lines bursting forth with a joy, that the tongue
sufficeth not to express the measure of; how they shout, indicating by that utterance the
4392 Lat. XCIV. A discourse delivered at the bidding of Aurelius bishop of Carthage, or perhaps of Valerius
bishop of Hippo, and consequently either before or shortly after St. Augustin was consecrated bishop.

Psalm XCV
Psalm XCV
feeling of the mind, which cannot in words express what is conceived in the heart. If they
then in earthly joy make a joyful noise; might we not do so from heavenly joy, which truly
we cannot express in words?
4. “Let us prevent His face by confession” (ver. 2). Confession hath a double meaning
in Scripture. There is a confession of him who praiseth, there is that of him who groaneth.
The confession of praise pertaineth to the honour of Him who is praised: the confession of
groaning to the repentance of him who confesseth. For men confess when they praise God:
they confess when they accuse themselves; and the tongue hath no more worthy use. Truly,
I believe these to be the very vows, of which he speaketh in another Psalm: “I will pay Thee
my vows, which I distinguished with my lips.”4394 Nothing is more elevated than that dis-
tinguishing, nothing is so necessary both to understand and to do. How then dost thou
distinguish the vows which thou payest unto God? By praising Him, by accusing thyself;
because it is His mercy, to forgive us our sins. For if He chose to deal with us after our
deserts, He would find cause only to condemn. “O come,” he said therefore, that we may at
last go back from our sins, and that He may not cast up with us our accounts for the past;
but that as it were a new account may be commenced, all the bonds of our debts having
been burnt.…The more therefore thou despairedst of thyself on account of thy iniquities,
do thou confess thy sins; for so much greater is the praise of Him who forgiveth, as is the
fulness of the penitent’s confession more abundant. Let us not therefore imagine that we
have receded from the song of praise, in understanding here that confession by which we
acknowledge our transgressions: this is even a part of the song of praise; for when we confess
our sins, we praise the glory of God.
5. “And make a joyful4395 noise unto Him with Psalms.” We have already said what it
is “to make a joyful noise:” the word is repeated, that it may be confirmed by the act: the
very repetition is an exhortation. For we have not forgotten, so as to wish to be again admon-
ished what was said above, that we should make a joyful noise: but usually in passages of
strong feeling a well-known word is repeated, not to make it more familiar, but that the very
repetition may strengthen the impression made: for it is repeated that we may understand
the feeling of the speaker.…Hear now: “For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above
all gods” (ver. 3) “For the Lord will not cast off His people.”4396 Praise be unto Him, and
shouts of joy be unto Him! What people shall He not cast off? we have no right to make our
own explanation here: for the Apostle hath prescribed this unto us, he hath explained
whereof it is said. For this was the Jewish people, the people where were the prophets, the
people where were the patriarchs, the people begotten according to the flesh from the seed
4394 Ps. lxvi. 13, 14.
4395 Jubilemus.
4396 Ps. xciv. 14. In the Sept. these nine words are added.
Psalm XCV
of Abraham; the people in which all the mysteries which promised our Saviour preceded
us; the people among whom was instituted the temple, the anointing, the Priest for a figure,
that when all these shadows were past, the Light itself might come; this therefore was the
people of God; to it were the prophets sent, in it those who were sent were born; to it were
delivered and entrusted the revelations of God. What then? is the whole of that people
condemned? far be it. It is called the good olive-tree by the Apostle, for it commenced with
the patriarchs.…This then is the tree itself: though some of its boughs have been broken,
yet all have not. For if all the boughs were broken, whence is Peter? whence John? whence
Thomas? whence Matthew? whence Andrew? whence are all those Apostles? whence that
very Apostle Paul who was speaking to us but now, and by his own fruit bearing witness to
the good olive? Were not all these of that people? Whence also those five hundred brethren
to whom our Lord appeared after His resurrection?4397 Whence were so many thousands
at the words of Peter (when the Apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit, spoke with the tongues
of all nations4398) converted with such zeal for the honour of God and their own accusation,
that they who first shed the Lord’s blood in their rage, learnt how to drink it now that they
believed? And all these five thousand were so converted that they sold their own property,
and laid the price of it at the Apostles’ feet.4399 That which one rich man did not do, when
he heard from the Lord’s mouth, and sorrowfully departed from Him,4400 this so many
thousands of those men by whose hands Christ had been crucified, did on a sudden. In
proportion as the wound was deeper in their own hearts, with the greater eagerness did they
seek for a physician. Since therefore all these were from thence, the Psalm saith of them,
“For the Lord will not cast off His people.”…
6. What doth the Psalm add? “In His hand are all the corners of the earth” (ver. 4): we
recognise the corner stone: the corner stone is Christ. There cannot be a corner, unless it
hath united in itself two walls: they come from different sides to one corner, but they are
not opposed to each other in the corner. The circumcision cometh from one side: the uncir-
cumcision from the other; in Christ both peoples have met together: because He hath become
the stone, of which it is written, “The stone which the builders rejected, hath become the
head of the corner.”4401…
7. “For the sea is His and He made it” (ver. 5). For the sea is this world, but God made
also the sea: nor can the waves rage save only so far as to the shore, where He hath marked
their bounds. There is therefore no temptation, that hath not received its measure.…“And

His hands prepared the dry land.” Be thou the dry land: thirst for the grace of God: that as
a sweet shower it may come upon thee, may find in thee fruit. He alloweth not the waves to
cover what He hath sown. “And His hands prepared the dry land.” Hence also therefore let
us shout unto the Lord.
8. “O come, let us worship, and fall down to Him; and mourn before the Lord our
Maker” (ver. 6).…Perhaps thou art burning with the consciousness of a fault; blot out with
tears the flame of thy sin: mourn before the Lord: fearlessly mourn before the Lord, who
made thee; for He despiseth not the work of His own hands in thee. Think not thou canst
be restored by thyself. By thyself thou mayest fall off, thou canst not restore thyself: He who
made thee restoreth thee. “Let us mourn before the Lord our Maker:” weep before Him,
confess unto Him, prevent His face in confession. For who art thou who mournest before
Him, and confessest unto Him, but one whom He created? The thing created hath no slight
confidence in Him who created it, and that in no indifferent fashion, but according to His
own image and likeness.
9. “For He is the Lord our God” (ver. 7). But that we may without fear fall down and
kneel before Him, what are we? “We are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His
hand.” See how elegantly he hath transposed the order of the words, and as it were not given
its own attribute to each word; that we may understand these very same to be the sheep,
who are also the people. He said not, the sheep of His pasture, and the people of His hand;
which might be thought more congruous, since the sheep belong to the pasture; but He said,
“the people of His pasture.” The people are therefore sheep, since he saith, “the people of
His pasture:” the people themselves are sheep.…He praiseth these sheep also in the Song of
Solomon, speaking of some perfect ones as the teeth of His Spouse the Holy Church: “Thy
teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which come up from the washing;
whereof every one beareth twins, and there is none barren.”4402 What meaneth, “Thy teeth”?
These by whom thou speakest: for the teeth of the Church are those through whom she
speaketh. Of what sort are thy teeth? “Like a flock of sheep that are shorn.” Why, “that are
shorn”? Because they have laid aside the burdens of the world. Were not those sheep, of
which I was a little before speaking, shorn, whom the bidding of God had shorn, when He
saith, “Go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor; and thou shalt find treasure in
heaven: and come and follow Me”?4403 They performed this bidding: shorn they came. And
because those who believe in Christ are baptized, what is there said? “which come up from
the washing;” that is, come up from the cleansing. “Whereof every one beareth twins.” What
twins? Those two commandments, wherefrom hang all the Law and the Prophets.4404

10. Therefore, “To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts” (ver. 8). O my
people, the people of God! God addresses His people: not only the people of His which He
shall not cast off, but also all His people. For He speaketh in the corner stone4405 to each
wall: that is, prophecy speaketh in Christ, both to the people of the Jews, and the people of
the Gentiles. For some time ye heard His voice through Moses, and hardened your hearts.
He then, when you hardened your hearts, spoke through a herald; He now speaketh by
Himself, let your hearts soften. He who used to send heralds before Him, hath now deigned
to come Himself; He here speaketh by His own mouth, He who used to speak by the mouths
of the Prophets.
11. “As in the provocation, and in the day of temptation in the wilderness, where your
fathers proved Me” (ver. 9). Let such be no more your fathers: imitate them not. They were
your fathers, but if ye do not imitate them, they shall not be your fathers: yet as ye were born
of them, they were your fathers. And if the heathen who came from the ends of the earth,
in the words of Jeremias, “The Gentiles shall come unto Thee from the ends of the earth,
and shall say, Surely our forefathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is
no profit:”4406 if the heathen forsook their idols, to come to the God of Israel; ought Israel
whom their own God led from Egypt through the Red Sea,4407 wherein He overwhelmed
their pursuing foes; whom He led out into the wilderness, fed with manna,4408 never took
His rod from correcting them, never deprived them of the blessings of His mercy; ought
they to desert their own God, when the heathen have come unto Him? “When your fathers
tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works.…
12. “Forty years long was I very near unto this generation, and said, It is a people that
do always err in their hearts; for they have not known My ways” (ver. 10). The forty years
have the same meaning as the word “always.” For that number forty indicates the fulness
of ages, as if the ages were perfected in this number. Hence our Lord fasted forty days, forty
days He was tempted in the desert,4409 and forty days He was with His disciples after His
resurrection.4410 On the first forty days He showed us temptation, on the latter forty days
consolation: since beyond doubt when we are tempted we are consoled. For His body, that
is, the Church, must needs suffer temptations in this world: but that Comforter, who said,
“Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world,”4411 is not wanting. For this was

I with them forty years, to show such a race of men, which alway provoketh Me, even unto

world’s duration.
13. …We began with exulting joy: but this Psalm hath ended with great fear: “Unto
whom I sware in My wrath, that they should not enter into My rest” (ver. 11). It is a great
thing for God to speak: how much greater for Him to swear? Thou shouldest fear a man
when he sweareth, lest he do somewhat on account of his oath against his will: how much
more shouldest thou fear God, when He sweareth, seeing He can swear nought rashly? He
chose the act of swearing for a confirmation. And by whom doth God swear? By Himself:
for He hath no greater by whom to swear.4412 By Himself He confirmeth His promises: by
Himself He confirmeth His threats. Let no man say in his heart, His promise is true; His
threat is false: as His promise is true, so is His threat sure. Thou oughtest to be equally assured
of rest, of happiness, of eternity, of immortality, if thou hast executed His commandments;
as of destruction, of the burning of eternal fire, of damnation with the devil, if thou hast
despised His commandments.…

Psalm XCV
Psalm XCVI.4413
1. My lord and brother Severus4414 still defers the pleasure we shall feel in his discourse,
which he oweth us; for he acknowledgeth, that he is held a debtor. For all the Churches
through which he hath passed, by his tongue the lord hath gladdened: much more therefore
ought that Church to be rejoiced, out of which the Lord hath propagated his preaching
among the rest. But what shall we do, but obey his will? I said, however, brethren, that he
deferred, not that he defrauded us. Therefore let us keep him as a debtor bound, and release
him not until he hath paid. Attend therefore, beloved: as far as the Lord alloweth, let us say
somewhat of this Psalm, which indeed you already know; for the fresh mention of truth is
sweet. Possibly when its title was pronounced, some heard it with wonder. For the Psalm is
inscribed: “When the house was being built after the Captivity.” This title having been pre-
fixed, ye were perhaps expecting in the text of the Psalm to hear what stones were hewn
from the mountains, what masses were drawn to the spot, what foundations were laid, what
beams were placed on high, what columns raised. Its song is of nothing of this kind.…It is
no such house that is in building; for behold where it is built, not in one spot, not in any
particular region. For thus he beginneth:—
2. “O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth”4415 (ver. 1). If
all the earth singeth a new song, it is thus building while it singeth: the very act of singing
is building: but only, if it singeth not the old song. The lust of the flesh singeth the old song:
the love of God singeth the new.…Hear why it is a new song: the Lord saith, “A new com-
mandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.”4416 The whole earth then singeth a
new song: there the house of God is built. All the earth is the house of God. If all the earth
is the house of God,4417 he who clingeth not to all the earth, is a ruin, not a house; that old
ruin whose shadow that ancient temple represented. For there what was old was destroyed,
that what was new might be built up.…The Apostle bindeth us together into this very
structure, and fasteneth us when bound together in that unity, saying, “Forbearing one an-
other in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”4418 Where
there is this unity of Spirit, there is one stone; but one stone formed out of many. How one
formed out of many? By forbearing one another in love. Therefore the house of the Lord
our God is in building; it is this that is being wrought, for this are these words, for this these

readings, for this the preaching of the Gospel over the whole world; as yet it is in building.
This house hath increased greatly, and filled many nations: nevertheless, it hath not yet
prevailed through all nations: by its increase it hath held many, and will prevail over all: and
it is gainsaid by those who boast of their being of its household, and who say, it hath already
lost ground. It still increaseth, still all those nations which have not yet believed are destined
to believe; that no man may say, will that tongue believe? will the barbarians believe? what
is the meaning of the Holy Spirit having appeared in the fiery tongues, 4419 except that there
is no tongue so hard that it cannot be softened by that fire? For we know that many barbarous
nations have already believed in Christ: Christ already possesseth regions where the Roman
empire hath never yet reached; what is as yet closed to those who fight with the sword, is
not closed to Him who fighteth with wood. For “the Lord hath reigned from the wood.”4420
Who is it who fighteth with wood? Christ. With His cross He hath vanquished kings, and
fixed upon their forehead, when vanquished, that very cross; and they glory in it, for in it
is their salvation. This is the work which is being wrought, thus the house increaseth, thus
it is building: and that ye may know, hear the following verses of the Psalm: see them labour-
ing upon, and constructing the house. “O sing unto the Lord all the earth.”
3. “Sing unto the Lord, bless His Name: be telling good tidings of His salvation from
day to day” (ver. 2). How doth the building increase? “Be telling,” he saith, “good tidings of
His salvation from day to day.” Let it be preached from day to day; from day to day, he saith,
let it be built; let My house, saith God, increase. And as if it were said by the workmen,
Where dost Thou command it to be built? Where dost Thou will Thy house to increase?
Choose for us some level, spacious spot, if Thou wish an ample house built Thee. Where
dost Thou bid us be telling good tidings from day to day? He showeth the place: “Declare
His honour unto the heathen:” His honour, not yours. O ye builders, “Declare His honour
unto the heathen.” Should ye choose to declare your own honour, ye shall fall: if His, ye
shall be built up, while ye are building. Therefore they who choose to declare their own
honour, have refused to dwell in that house; and therefore they sing not a new song with
all the earth.4421 For they do not share it with the whole round world; and hence they are
not building in the house, but have erected a whited wall. How sternly doth God threaten
the whited wall?4422 There are innumerable testimonies of the Prophets, whence He curseth
the whited wall. What is the whited wall, save hypocrisy, that is, pretence? Without it is
bright, within it is dirt.…A certain person,4423 speaking of this whited wall, said thus: “as,

Psalm XCVI
if in a wall which standeth alone, and is not connected with any other walls, you make a
door, whoever enters, is out of doors; so in that part which hath refused to sing the new
song together with the house, but hath chosen to build a wall, and that a whited one, and
not solid, what availeth it that it hath a door?” If thou enterest, thou art found to be without.
For because they themselves did not enter by the door, their door also doth not admit them
within. For the Lord saith, “I am the door: by Me they enter in.”4424…“Declare His honour
unto the heathen.” What is, unto the heathen? Perhaps by nations but a few are meant: and
that part which hath raised the whited wall hath still somewhat to say: why are not Getulia,
Numidia, Mauritania, Byzacium, nations? Provinces are nations. Let the word of God take
the word from hypocrisy, from the whited wall, building up the house over the whole world.
It is not enough to say, “Declare His honour unto the heathen;” that thou mayest not think
any nations excepted, he addeth, “and His wonders unto all people.”
4. “For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised” (ver. 4). What Lord, except
Jesus Christ, “is great, and cannot worthily be praised”? Ye know surely that He appeared
as a Man: ye know surely that He was conceived in a woman’s womb, ye know that He was
born from the womb, that He was suckled, that He was carried in arms, circumcised, that
a victim was offered for Him, that He grew; lastly, ye know that He was buffeted, spit upon,
crowned with thorns, was crucified, died, was pierced with a spear; ye know that He suffered
all these things: “He is great, and cannot worthily be praised.” Despise not what is little,
understand what is great. He became little, because ye were such: let Him be acknowledged
great, and in Him ye shall be great.…For what can a small tongue say towards the praise of
the Great One? By saying, Beyond praise,4425 he hath spoken, and hath given to imagination
what it may conceive: as if saying, What I cannot utter, do thou reflect on; and when thou
shalt have reflected, it will not be enough. What no man’s thought uttereth, doth any man’s
tongue utter? “The Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised.” Let Him be praised, and
preached: His honour declared, and His house built.
5. …For the spot where he wished to build the house, is itself woody, where it was said
yesterday, “we found it in the wood.”4426 For he was seeking that very house, when he said,
“in the wood.” And why is that spot woody? Men used to worship images: it is not wonderful
that they fed hogs. For that son who left his father, and spent his all on harlots, living as a
prodigal, used to feed hogs,4427 that is, to worship devils; and by this very superstition of
the heathen, all the earth became a wood. But he who buildeth a house, rooteth up the wood;
and for this reason it was said, “While the house was being built, after the captivity.”4428

Psalm XCVI
For men were held captive under the devil, and served devils; but they were redeemed from
captivity. They could sell, but they could not redeem themselves. The Redeemer came, and
gave a price; He poured forth His Blood, and bought the whole world. Ye ask what He
bought? Ye see what He hath given; find out then what He bought. The Blood of Christ was
the price. What is equal to this? What, but the whole world? What, but all nations? They
are very ungrateful for their price, or very proud, who say that the price is so small that it
bought the Africans only; or that they are so great, as that it was given for them alone. Let
them not then exult, let them not be proud: He gave what He gave for the whole world. He
knew what He bought, because He knew at what price He bought it. Thus because we are
redeemed, the house is built after the captivity. And who are they who held us in captivity?
Because they to whom it is said, “Declare His honour,” are the clearers of the wood: that
they may root out the wood, free the earth from captivity, and build, and raise up, by declaring
the greatness of the Lord’s house. How is the wood of devils cleared away, unless He who
is above them all be preached? All nations then had devils for their gods: those whom they
called gods, were devils, as the Apostle more openly saith, “The things which the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice unto devils, and not to God.” 4429 Since therefore they were in cap-
tivity, because they sacrificed to devils, and on that account the whole earth had remained
woody; He is declared to be great, and above all worldly praise.
6. …For when he had said, “He is more to be feared than all gods:” he added, “As for
all the gods of the heathen, they are devils.”…Because “all the gods of the heathen are devils.”
And is this all the praise of Him who cannot worthily be praised, that He is above all the
gods of the heathen, which are devils? Wait, and hear what followeth: “It is the Lord that
made the heavens.” Not above all gods only therefore, but above all the heavens which He
made, is the Lord. If he were to say, “above all gods, for the gods of the heathen are devils,”
and if the praise of our Lord stopped here, he had said less than we are accustomed to think
of Christ; but when he said, “But it is the Lord that made the heavens;” see what difference
there is between the heavens and devils: and what between the heavens and Him who made
the heavens; behold how exalted is the Lord. He said not, But the Lord sitteth above the
heavens; for perhaps some one else might be imagined to have made them, upon which He
was enthroned: but, “It is the Lord that made the heavens.” If He made the heavens, He
made the Angels also: Himself made the Angels, Himself made the Apostles. The devils
yielded to the Apostles: but the Apostles themselves were heavens, who bore the Lord.…O
heavens, which He made, declare His honour unto the heathen! Let His house be built
throughout the earth, let all the earth sing a new song.
7. “Confession and beauty are before Him” (ver. 6). Dost thou love beauty? Wishest
thou to be beautiful? Confess! He said not, beauty and confession, but confession and beauty.
4429 1 Cor. x. 20.
Psalm XCVI
Thou wast foul; confess, that thou mayest be fair: thou wast a sinner; confess, that thou
mayest be righteous. Thou couldest deform thyself: thou canst not make thyself beautiful.
But of what sort is our Betrothed, who hath loved one deformed, that he might make her
fair? How, saith some one, loved He one deformed? “I came not,” said He, “to call the
righteous, but sinners.”4430 Whom callest Thou? sinners, that they may remain sinners?
No, saith He. And by what means will they cease to be sinners? “Confession and beauty are
before Him.” They honour Him by confession of their sins, they vomit the evils which they
had greedily devoured; they return not to their vomit, like the unclean dog;4431 and there
will then be confession and beauty: we love beauty; let us first choose confession, that beauty
may follow. Again, there is one who loveth power and greatness: he wisheth to be great as
the Angels are. There is a certain greatness in the Angels; and such power, that if the Angels
exert it to the full, it cannot be withstood. And every man desireth the power of the Angels,
but their righteousness every man loveth not. First love righteousness, and power shall follow
thee. For what followeth here? “Holiness and greatness are in His sanctification.” Thou wast
before seeking for greatness: first love righteousness: when thou art righteous, thou shall
also be great. For if thou preposterously dost wish first to be great, thou fallest before thou
canst rise: for thou dost not rise, thou art raised up. Thou risest better, if He raise thee who
falleth not. For He who falleth not descendeth unto thee: thou hadst fallen: He descendeth,
He hath stretched forth His hand unto thee; thou canst not rise by thy own strength, embrace
the hand of Him who descendeth, that thou mayest be raised up by the Strong One.
8. What then? If “confession and beauty are before Him: holiness and greatness in His
sanctification” (ver. 7). This we declare, when we are building the house; behold, it is already
declared unto the heathen; what ought the heathen to do, to whom those who have cleared
away the wood have declared the Lord’s honour? He now saith to the heathen themselves,
“Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord worship and
honour.” Ascribe them not unto yourselves: because they also who have declared it unto
you, have not declared their own, but His honour. Do ye then “ascribe unto the Lord worship
and honour;” and say, “Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us: but unto Thy Name give the
praise.”4432 Put not your trust in man. If each of you is baptized, let him say: He baptizeth
me, of whom the friend of the Bridegroom said, “He baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.”4433
For when ye say this, ye ascribe unto the Lord worship and honour: “Ascribe unto the Lord
worship and honour.”

9. “Ascribe unto the Lord glory unto His Name” (ver. 8). Not unto the name of man,
not unto your own name, but unto His ascribe worship.…Confession is a present unto God.
O heathen, if ye will enter into His courts, enter not empty. “Bring presents.” What presents
shall we bring with us? The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and a contrite
heart, “O God, shalt not Thou despise.” 4434 Enter with an humble heart into the house of
God, and thou hast entered with a present. But if thou art proud, thou enterest empty. For
whence wouldest thou be proud, if thou wert not empty? For if thou wast full, thou wouldest
not be puffed up. How couldest thou be full? If thou wert to bring a present, which thou
shouldest carry to the courts of the Lord. Let us not retain you much longer: let us run over
what remaineth. Behold the house increasing: behold the edifice pervade the whole world.
Rejoice, because ye have entered into the courts; rejoice, because ye are being built into the
temple of God. For those who enter are themselves built up, they themselves are the house
of God: He is the inhabitor, for whom the house is built over the whole world, and this “after
the captivity.” “Bring presents, and come into His courts.”
10. “O worship the Lord in His holy court” (ver. 9): in the Catholic Church; this is His
holy court. Let no man say, “Lo, here is Christ, or there. For there shall arise false proph-
ets.”4435 Say this unto them,4436 “There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that
shall not be thrown down.” Ye are calling me to the whited wall; I adore my God in His holy
court. “Let the whole earth be moved before His face.”
11. “Tell it out among the nations, that the Lord reigneth from the wood:4437 and that
it is He who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved” (ver. 10). What
testimonies of the building of the house of God! The clouds of heaven thunder out
throughout the world that God’s house is being built; and the frogs cry from the marsh,4438
We alone are Christians. What testimonies do I bring forward? That of the Psalter. I bring
forward what thou singest as one deaf: open thine ears; thou singest this; thou singest with
me, and thou agreest not with me; thy tongue soundeth what mine doth, and yet thine heart
disagreeth with mine. Dost thou not sing this? Behold the testimonies of the whole world:
“Let the whole earth be moved before His face:” and dost thou say, that thou art not moved?
“Tell it out among the heathen, that the Lord hath reigned from the wood.” Shall men per-
chance prevail here, and say they reign by wood, because they reign by means of the clubs
of their bandits?4439 Reign by the Cross of Christ, if thou art to reign by wood. For this wood

of thine maketh thee wooden: the wood of Christ passeth thee across the sea. Thou hearest
the Psalm saying, “He hath set aright the round world, that it cannot be moved;” and thou
sayest it hath not only been moved since it was made fast, but hath also decreased. Dost
thou speak the truth, and the Psalmist falsehood? Do the false prophets, when they cry out,
“Lo, here is Christ, and there,” 4440 speak truth; and doth this Prophet lie? Brethren, against
these most open words ye hear in the corners rumours like these; “such an one was a traditor,”
and, “such an one was a traditor.”4441 What dost thou say? Are thy words, or the words of
God, to be heard? For, “it is He who hath set aright the round world, that it cannot be
moved.” I show unto thee the round world built: bring thy present, and come into the courts
of the Lord. Thou hast no presents: and on that account thou art not willing to enter. What
is this? If God were to appoint unto thee a bull, goat, or ram, for a present, thou wouldest
find one to bring: He hath appointed a humble heart, and thou wilt not enter; for thou
findest not this in thyself, because thou art swollen with pride. “He hath set aright the round
world, that it cannot be moved: and He shall judge the people righteously.” Then shall they
mourn, who now refuse to love righteousness.
12. “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad” (ver. 11). Let the heavens, which
declare the glory of God, rejoice; let the heavens rejoice, which the Lord made; let the earth
be glad, which the heavens rain upon. For the heavens are the preachers, the earth the
listeners. “Let the sea be stirred up, and the fulness thereof.” What sea? The world. The sea
hath been stirred up, and the fulness thereof: the whole world was roused up against the
Church, while it was being extended and built over all the earth. Concerning this stirring
up, ye have heard in the Gospel, “They shall deliver you up to councils.”4442 “The sea was
stirred up: but how should the sea ever conquer Him who made it?
13. “The plains shall be joyful, and all things that are in them” (ver. 12). All the meek,
all the gentle, all the righteous, are the “plains” of God. “Then shall all the trees of the woods
rejoice.” The trees of the woods are the heathen. Why do they rejoice? Because they were
cut off from the wild olive, and engraffed into the good olive.4443 “Then shall all the trees
of the woods rejoice:” because huge cedars and cypresses have been cut down, and undecaying
timbers have been bought for the building of the house. They were trees of the woods; but
before they were sent to the building: they were trees of the woods, but before they produced
the olive.
14. “Before the face of the Lord. For He cometh, for He cometh to judge the world” (ver.
13). He came at first, and will come again. He first came in His Church in clouds. What are

the clouds which bore Him? The Apostles who preached, respecting whom ye have heard,
when the Epistle was being read: “We are ambassadors,” he saith, “for Christ: we pray you
in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.” 4444 These are the clouds in whom He cometh,
excepting His last Advent, when He will come to judge the quick and the dead. He came
first in the clouds. This was His first voice which sounded forth in the Gospel: “From this
time shall they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds.”4445 What is, “from this time”?
Will not the Lord come in later times, when all the tribes of the earth shall mourn? He first
came in His own preachers, and filled the whole round world. Let us not resist His first
coming, that we may not tremble at His second. “But woe to them that are with child, and
that give suck in those days!”4446 Ye have heard but now in the Gospel: “Take ye heed, for
ye know not at what hour He cometh.”4447 This is said figuratively. Who are those with
child, and who give suck? Those who are with child, are the souls whose hope is in the world:
but those who have gained what they hoped for, are meant by “they who give suck.” For
example: one wisheth to buy a country seat; he is with child, for his object is not gained as
yet, the womb swelleth in hope: he buyeth it; he hath brought forth, he now giveth suck to
what he hath bought. “Woe to them that are with child, and that give suck in those days!”
Woe to those who put their hope in the world; woe to them that cling to those things which
they brought forth through hope in the world. What then should the Christian do? He
should use, not serve, the world.4448 What is this? Those that have as those that have not.…He
who is without carefulness, waiteth without fear for his Lord’s coming. For what sort of love
is it of Christ, to fear lest He come? Brethren, are we not ashamed? We love Him, and yet
we fear lest He come. Are we sure that we love Him? or do we love our sins more? Therefore
let us hate our sins for their own sake, and love Him who will come to punish our sins. He
will come, whether we like or not: for because He cometh not just now, it is no reason that
He will not come at all. He will come, and when thou knowest not; and if He shall find thee
ready, thy ignorance is no hurt to thee. “Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before
the Lord; for He cometh:” at His first coming. And what afterwards? “For He cometh to
judge the earth. And all the trees of the woods shall rejoice.” He came first: and later to judge
the earth: He shall find those rejoicing who believed in His first coming, “for He cometh.”
15. “For with righteousness shall He judge the world:” not a part of it, for He bought
not a part: He will judge the whole, for it was the whole of which He paid the price. Ye have
heard the Gospel, where it saith, that when He cometh, “He shall gather together His elect

from the four winds.”4449 He gathereth all His elect from the four winds: therefore from
the whole world. For Adam4450 himself (this I had said before) signifieth in Greek the whole
world; for there are four letters, A, D, A, and M. But as the Greeks speak, the four quarters
of the world have these initial letters, ’Ανατολὴ, they call the East; Δύσις, the West; ῎Αρκτος,
the North; Μεσημβρία, the South: thou hast the word Adam. Adam therefore hath been
scattered over the whole world. He was in one place, and fell, and as in a manner broken
small,4451 he filled the whole world: but the mercy of God gathered together the fragments
from every side, and forged4452 them by the fire of love, and made one what was broken.
That Artist knew how to do this; let no one despair: it is indeed a great thing, but reflect
who that Artist was. He who made, restored: He who formed, reformed. What are righteous-
ness and truth? He will gather together His elect with Him to the judgment, but the rest He
will separate one from another; for He will place some on the right, others on the left hand.
But what is more just, what more true, than that they shall not expect mercy from their
Judge, who have refused to act mercifully, before their Judge come? But those who chose to
act with mercy, with mercy shall be judged.…

Psalm XCVI
Psalm XCVII.4453
1. …This Psalm is entitled, “A Psalm of David’s, when his land was restored.” Let us
refer the whole to Christ, if we wish to keep the road of a right understanding: let us not
depart from the corner stone,4454 lest our understanding suffer a fall: in Him let that become
fixed, which wavered with unstable motion; let that rest upon Him, which before was waving
to and fro in uncertainty. Whatever doubt a man hath in his mind when he heareth the
Scriptures of God, let him not depart from Christ; when Christ hath been revealed to him
in the words, let him then be assured that he hath understood; but before he arriveth at the
understanding of Christ, let him not presume that he hath understood. “For Christ is the
end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”4455 What doth this mean, and
how are these words understood in Christ, “When his land was restored”?…
2. The earth restored is the resurrection of the flesh; for after His resurrection, all those
things which are sung of in the Psalm were done. Let us then hear a Psalm full of joy on the
restoration of the Earth. Let the Lord our God excite in us a hope and a pleasure worthy of
so great a thing; may He rule our discourse, that it be fit for your hearts, that whatever joy
our heart doth feel in such sights, He may bring on to our tongue, and thence conduct it
into your ears, then to your heart, thence to your actions.
3. …“The Lord is King, let the earth be glad: yea, let the multitude of the isles be joyous”
(ver. 1). It is so indeed, because the word of God hath been preached not in the continent
alone, but also in those isles which lie in mid sea: even these are full of Christians, full of the
servants of God. For the sea doth not retard Him who made it. Where ships can approach,
cannot the words of God? The isles are filled. But figuratively the isles may be taken for all
the Churches. Why isles? Because the waves of all temptations roar around them. But as an
isle may be beaten by the waves which on every side dash around it, yet cannot be broken,
and rather itself doth break the advancing waves, than by them is broken: so also the Churches
of God, springing up throughout the world, have suffered the persecutions of the ungodly,
who roar around them on every side; and behold the isles stand fixed, and at last the sea is
calmed.
4. “Clouds and darkness are round about Him: righteousness and judgment are the
direction of His seat” (ver. 2).…The Lord Himself saith: “For judgment I am come into this
world; that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind.”4456
They who seem unto themselves to see, who think themselves wise, who think healing not
needful for them, that they may be made blind, may not understand. And that “they which

Psalm XCVII
see not may see;” that they who confess their blindness may obtain to be enlightened. Let
there be therefore “clouds and darkness round about Him,” for those who have not under-
stood Him: for those who confess and humble themselves, “righteousness and judgment
are the direction of His seat.” He called those who believe in Him His seat: for from them
hath He made Himself a seat, since in them Wisdom sitteth; for the Son of God is the Wisdom
of God. But we have heard from another passage of Scripture a strong confirmation of this
interpretation. “The soul of the righteous is the seat of Wisdom.”4457 Because then they
who have believed in Him have been made righteous: justified by faith, they have become
His own seat: He sitteth in them, judging from them, and guiding them.…
5. “There shall go a fire before Him, and burn up His enemies on every side” (ver. 3).
We remember having read in the Gospel, He shall say, “Depart into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels.”4458 I do not think it is said of that fire. Why do I not? Because
he speaketh of some fire, which shall go before Him, before He cometh to judgment. For it
is said, that the fire goeth before Him, and burneth up His enemies on every side, that is,
throughout the whole world. That fire will burn after His advent: this, on the contrary, will
go before Him. What fire then is this?…Behold, we have understood the fire that goeth before
Him, that is to be understood of a kind of temporal punishment of the unbelieving and
ungodly: let us understand the fire, if possible, of the salvation of the redeemed also; for
thus we had proposed. The Lord Himself saith: “I am come to send fire on the earth:”4459
“fire” in the same way as a “sword;” as in another passage He saith, that He was not come
to send peace, but a sword, upon earth.4460 The sword to divide, the fire to burn: but each
salutary: for the sword of His own word hath in salutary wise separated us from evil habits.
For He brought a sword, and separated every believer either from his father who believed
not in Christ, or from his mother in like manner unbelieving: or at least, if we were born of
Christian parents, from his ancestors. For no man among us had not either a grandsire, or
great grandsire, or some ancestry among the heathen, and in that unbelief which is accursed
before God. We are separated from that which we were before; but the sword which separ-
ateth, but slayeth not, hath cut between us. In the same way the fire also: “I am come to send
fire upon the earth.” Believers in Him were set on fire, they received the flame of love: and
for this reason when the Holy Spirit itself had been sent to the Apostles, It thus appeared:
“cloven tongues, like as of fire.”4461 Burning with this fire they set out on their march through
4457 Prov. xii. 23; 1 Cor. i. 24.

4459 Luke xii. 49.

4461 Acts ii. 3.
Psalm XCVII
the world, to burn and set on fire His enemies on every side. What enemies of His? They
who forsaking the God who made them, adored the idols they had made.…
6. “His lightnings gave shine unto the world” (ver. 4). This is great joy. Do we not see?
is it not clear? His lightnings have shined unto the whole world: His enemies have been set
on fire, and burnt. All that gainsaid hath been burnt, and “His lightnings have given shine
unto the world.” How have they shone? That the world might at length believe. Whence
were the lightnings? From the clouds. What are the clouds of God? The preachers of the
truth. But thou seest a cloud, misty and dark in the sky, and it hath I know not what hidden
within it. If there be lightning from the cloud, a brightness shineth forth: from that which
thou didst despise, hath burst forth that which thou mayest dread. Our Lord Jesus Christ
therefore sent His Apostles, as His preachers, like clouds: they were seen as men, and were
despised; as clouds appear, and are despised, until what thou wonderest at gleameth from
them. For they were in the first place men encumbered with flesh, weak; then, men of low
station, unlearned, ignoble: but there was within what could lighten forth; there was in them
what could flash abroad. Peter a fisherman approached, prayed, and the dead arose.4462 His
human form was a cloud, the splendour of the miracle was the lightning. So in their words,
so in their deeds, when they do things to be wondered at, and utter words to be wondered
at, “His lightnings gave shine unto the world; the earth saw it, and was afraid.” Is it not true?
Doth not the whole Christian world at length exclaim, Amen, afraid at the lightnings which
burst forth from those clouds?
7. “The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord” (ver. 5). Who are the hills?
The proud. Every high thing raising itself against God, at the deeds of Christ and of the
Christians, trembled, yielded, and when I say, what hath been already said, “melted,” a better
word cannot be found. “The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord.” Where is the
elevation of powers? where the hardness of the unbelieving? The Lord was a fire unto them,
they melted at His presence like wax; so long hard, until that fire was applied. Every height
hath been levelled; it dareth not now blaspheme Christ: and though the Pagan believeth not
in Him, he blasphemeth Him not; though not as yet become a living stone, yet the hard hill
hath been subdued. “At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth:” not of the Jews only,
but of the Gentiles also, as the Apostle saith; for He is not the God of the Jews alone, but of
the Gentiles also.4463 He is therefore the Lord of the whole earth, the Lord Jesus Christ born
in Judæa, but not born for Judæa alone, because before He was born He created all men;
and He who created, also new created, all men.
8. “The heavens have declared His righteousness: and all the people have seen His glory”
(ver. 6). What heavens have declared? “The heavens declare the glory of God.”4464 Who are
4462 Acts ix. 40.
4463 Rom. iii. 29.
4464 Ps. xix. 1.
Psalm XCVII
the heavens? Those who have become His seat; for as God sitteth in the heavens, so doth
He sit in the Apostles, so doth He sit in the preachers of the Gospel. Even thou, if thou wilt,
shalt be a heaven. Dost thou wish to be so? Purge from thy heart the earth. If thou hast not
earthly lusts, and hast not in vain uttered the response, that thou hast “lifted up thy heart,”
thou shalt be a heaven.4465 “If ye be risen with Christ,” saith the Apostle to believers, “set
your affection on things above, not on things of the earth.”4466 Thou hast begun to set thine
affection upon things above, not on things upon earth; hast thou not become a heaven?
Thou carriest flesh, and in thy heart thou art already a heaven; for thy conversation will be
in heaven.4467 Being such, thou also declarest Christ; for who of the faithful declareth not
Christ?…Therefore the whole Church preacheth Christ, and the heavens declare His right-
eousness; for all the faithful, whose care it is to gain unto God those who have not yet believed,
and who do this from love, are heavens. From them God thundereth forth the terror of His
judgment; and he who was unbelieving trembleth, and is alarmed, and believeth. He shows
unto men what power Christ had throughout the world, by pleading with them, and leading
them to love Christ. For how many this day have led their friends either to some pantomimist,
or flute-player? Why, except from their liking him? And do ye love Christ. For He who
conquered the world hath exhibited such spectacles, as that no man can say that he findeth
in them cause for blame. For each person’s favourite in the theatre is often vanquished there.
But no man is vanquished in Christ: there is no reason for shame. Seize, lead, draw, whom
ye may: be without fear, ye are leading unto Him, who displeaseth not those who see Him;
and ask ye Him to enlighten them, that they may behold to good account.
9. “Confounded be all they that worship carved images” (ver. 7). Hath not this come to
pass? Have they not been confounded? Are they not daily confounded? For carved images
are images wrought by the hand. Why are all who worship carved images confounded? Be-
cause all people have seen His glory. All nations now confess the glory of Christ: let those
who worship stones be ashamed. Because those stones were dead, we have found a living
Stone; indeed those stones never lived, so that they cannot be called even dead; but our
Stone is living, and hath ever lived with the Father, and though He died for us, He revived,
and liveth now, and death shall no more have dominion over Him.4468 This glory of His
the nations have acknowledged; they leave the temples, they run to the Churches. Do they
still seek to worship carved images? Have they not chosen to forsake their idols? They have
been forsaken by their idols. “Who glory in their idols.” But there is a certain disputer who
seemeth unto himself learned, and saith, I do not worship that stone, nor that image which
4465 [See on this, Dignum, etc., p. 332, note 1, supra.—C.]
4466 Col. iii. 1, 2.
4467 Philip. iii. 20.
4468 Rom. vi. 9.
Psalm XCVII
is without sense;…I worship not this image but I adore 4469 what I see, and serve him whom
I see not. Who is that? Some invisible deity, he replieth, who presideth over that image. By
giving this account of their images, they seem to themselves able disputants, because they
do not worship idols, and yet do worship devils. “The things,” brethren, saith the Apostle,
“which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice unto devils, and not to God; we know that an
idol is nothing: and that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God;
and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.”4470 Let them not therefore excuse
themselves on this ground, that they are not devoted to insensate idols; they are rather de-
voted to devils, which is more dangerous. For if they were only worshipping idols, as they
would not help them, so they would not hurt them; but if thou worship and serve devils,
they themselves will be thy masters.…
10. But observe holy men, who are like the Angels. When thou hast found some holy
man who serveth God, if thou wish to worship him instead of God, he forbiddeth thee: he
will not arrogate to himself the honour due to God, he will not be unto thee as God, but be
with thee under God. Thus did the holy Apostles Paul and Barnabas. They preached the
word of God in Lycaonia. When they had performed wonderful works in Lycaonia, the
people of that country brought victims, and wished to sacrifice to them, calling Barnabas
Jupiter, and Paul Mercury: they were not pleased. Did they perchance refuse to be sacrificed
to, because they abhorred to be compared to devils? No, but because they shuddered at divine
honour being paid to men. Their own words show this: it is no guess of ours; for the text of
the book goeth on to say how they were moved.4471…Just then, as good men forbade those
who had wished to worship them as gods, and wish rather that God alone be worshipped,
God alone be adored, to God alone sacrifice be offered, not to themselves; so also all the
holy Angels seek His glory whom they love; endeavour to impel and to excite to the contem-
plation of Him all whom they love: Him they declare to them, not themselves, since they
are angels; and because they are soldiers, they study only how to seek the glory of their
Captain; but if they have sought their own glory, they are condemned as usurpers.4472 Such
were the devil and his angels; he claimed for himself divine honour, and for all his demons;
he filled the Pagan temples, and persuaded them to offer images and sacrifices to himself.
Was it not better to worship holy Angels than devils? They answer: we do not worship
devils; we worship angels, as ye call them, the powers and the ministers of the great God. I
wish ye would worship them: ye would easily learn from themselves not to worship them.
4473 Hear an Angel teaching. He was teaching a disciple of Christ, and showing him many
4469 i.e. fall down before.

Psalm XCVII
wonders in the Revelation of John: and when some wonderful vision had been shown him,
he trembled, and fell down at the Angel’s feet; but that Angel, who sought not but the glory
of God, said, “See thou do it not; for I am a fellow-servant of thee, and of thy brethren the
prophets.”4474 What then, my brethren? Let no man say, I fear lest the Angel may be angry
with me, if I worship him not as my God. He is then angry with thee, when thou hast chosen
to worship him: for he is righteous, and loveth God. As devils are angry if they are not
worshipped, so are Angels angry if they are worshipped instead of God. But lest the weak
and trembling heart perchance say unto itself: If then the demons are incensed because they
are not worshipped, I fear to offend them; what can even their chief the devil do unto thee?
If he had any power over us no one of us would remain. Are not daily so many things said
against him by the mouth of Christians, and yet the harvest of Christians increaseth. When
thou art angry with the most depraved of thy slaves, thou givest him the name, “Satan,”
Devil. Perhaps in this thou dost err, since thou sayest it to a man, and thy immoderate anger
hurrieth thee to revile the image of God: and yet thou choosest a term thou deeply hatest,
to apply to him. If he could, would he not revenge himself? But it is not allowed: and he
doth so much only as is allowed him. For when he wished to tempt Job, he had to ask power
to do so:4475 and he could do nothing had he not received power. Why then dost thou not
fearlessly worship God, without whose will no one hurteth thee, and by whose permission
thou art chastened, not overcome? For if it shall have pleased the Lord thy God to permit
some man to hurt thee, or some spirit: He will chasten thee, that thou mayest cry unto
Him:4476 “Confounded,” therefore, “be all they that delight in vain gods: worship Him, all
ye His angels.” Let Pagans learn to worship God: they wish to worship Angels: let them
imitate Angels, and worship Him who is worshipped by Angels. “Worship Him, all ye His
angels.” Let that Angel worship who was sent to Cornelius (for worshipping Him he sent
Cornelius to Peter), himself Peter’s fellow-servant; let him worship Christ, Peter’s Lord.
“Worship Him, all ye gods!”
11. “Sion heard of it, and rejoiced” (ver. 8). What did Sion hear? That all His Angels
worship Him.…For the Church was not as yet among the Gentiles; in Judæa the Jews had
some of them believed, and the very Jews who believed thought that they only belonged to
Christ: the Apostles were sent to the Gentiles, Cornelius was preached to; Cornelius believed,
was baptized, and they who were with Cornelius were also baptized. 4477 But ye know what
happened, that they might be baptized: the reader indeed hath not reached this point, but,
nevertheless, some recollect; and let those who do not recollect, hear briefly from me. The
4474 Rev. xix. 10.
4475 Job i. 11.
4476 Ps. cxviii. 18.
4477 Acts x. 47.
Psalm XCVII
Angel was sent to Cornelius: the Angel sent Cornelius to Peter; Peter came to Cornelius.
And because Cornelius and his household were Gentiles, and uncircumcised: lest they might
hesitate to give the Gospel to the uncircumcised: before Cornelius and his household were
baptized, the Holy Spirit came, and filled them, and they began to speak with tongues. Now
the Holy Spirit had not fallen upon any one who had not been baptized: but upon these It
fell before baptism. For Peter might hesitate whether he might baptize the uncircumcised:
the Holy Spirit came, they began to speak with tongues; the invisible gift was given, and
took away all doubt about the visible Sacrament; they were all baptized.…What did Sion
hear, and rejoice at? That the Gentiles also had received the word of God. One wall had
come, but the corner existed not as yet. The name Sion is here peculiarly given to the Church
which was in Judæa. “Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad.”
Thus it is written, “The apostles and brethren that were in Judæa heard.” See if the daughters
of Judæa rejoiced not. What did they hear? “That the Gentiles had also received the word
of God.”…Therefore, “The daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Thy judgments, O Lord.”
What is, because of Thy judgments? Because in any nation, and in any people, he that serveth
Him is accepted of Him:4478 for He is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gen-
tiles.4479
12. See if this be not the reason for the joy of the daughters of Judah. “For Thou, Lord,
art most high over all the earth” (ver. 9). Not in Judæa alone, but over Jerusalem; not over
Sion only, but over all the earth. To this whole earth the judgments of God prevailed, so
that it assembled its nations from every quarter: judgments with which they who have cut
themselves off have no communion: they neither hear the prophecy, nor see its completion;
“For Thou, Lord, art most high over all the earth: Thou art exalted far above all gods.” What
is “far”? 4480 For it is said of Christ. What then meaneth “far,” except that Thou mayest be
acknowledged coequal with the Father? What meaneth, “above all gods”? Who are they?
Idols have not life, have not sense: devils have life and sense; but they are evil. What great
thing is it that Christ is exalted above devils? He is exalted above devils: but neither is this
very great; the heathen gods indeed are devils,4481 but “He is far above all gods.” Even men
are styled gods: “I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the Most Highest:”
again it is written, “God standeth in the congregation of princes: He is a Judge among
4478 Ps. xcvii. 35.
4479 Rom. iii. 29.
4480 Nimis.
4481 Ps. xcvi. 5.
Psalm XCVII
gods.”4482 Jesus Christ our Lord is exalted above all: not only above idols, not only above
devils; but above all righteous men. Even this is not enough; above all Angels also: for whence
otherwise is this, “Worship Him, all ye gods”? “Thou art far exalted above all gods.”
13. What then do we all, who have assembled before Him, before Him who is exalted
far above all gods? He hath given us a brief commandment, “O ye that love the Lord, see
that ye hate the thing which is evil!” (ver. 10). Christ doth not deserve that with Him thou
shouldest love avarice. Thou lovest Him: thou shouldest hate what He hateth. There is a
man who is thine enemy, he is what thou art; ye are the work of one Creator, with the same
nature: and yet if thy son were to speak unto thine enemy, and come to his house, and
constantly converse with him, thou wouldest be inclined to disinherit him; because he
speaketh with thine enemy. And how so? Because thou seemest to say justly, Thou art my
enemy’s friend, and seekest thou aught of my property? Attend then. Thou lovest Christ:
avarice is Christ’s foe; why speak with her? I say not, speak with her; why dost thou serve
her? For Christ commandeth thee to do many things, and thou dost them not; she com-
mandeth thee, and thou dost them. Christ commandeth thee to clothe the poor man: and
thou dost it not; avarice biddeth thee defraud, and this thou dost in preference. If such be
the case, if such thou art, do not very confidently promise thyself Christ’s heritage. But thou
sayest, I love Christ. Hence it appeareth that thou lovest what is good, if thou shalt be found
to hate what is evil.…
14. Because then he had said above, “see that ye hate the thing which is evil,” lest ye
should fear to hate evil, lest he should kill thee, he addeth instantly, “The Lord preserveth
the souls of His servants.” Hear Him preserving the souls of His servants, and saying, “Fear
not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.”4483 He who hath most power
against thee, slayeth the body. What hath he done unto thee? What he also did to the Lord
thy God. Why lovest thou to have what Christ hath, if thou fearest to suffer what Christ did?
He came to bear thy life, temporal, weak, subject unto death. Surely fear to die, if thou canst
avoid dying. What thou canst not avoid through thy nature, why dost thou not undergo by
faith? Let the adversary who threateneth take away from thee that life, God giveth thee an-
other life: for He gave thee this life also, and without His will even this shall not be taken
from thee; but if it be His will that it be taken from thee, He hath a life to give thee in ex-
change; fear not to be robbed for His sake. Art thou unwilling to put off a patched garment?
He will give thee a robe of glory. What robe dost thou tell me of? “This corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”4484 This very flesh of thine
shall not perish. Thine enemy can rage as far as to thy death: he hath not power beyond,
4482 Ps. lxxxii. 6, 1.
4483 Matt. x. 28.
4484 1 Cor. xv. 53.
Psalm XCVII
either over thy soul, or even over thy flesh; for although he scatter thy flesh about, he
hindereth not the resurrection. Men were fearful for their life: and what said the Lord unto
them? “The very hairs of your head are all numbered.”4485 Dost thou, who losest not a single
hair, fear the loss of thy life? All things are numbered with God. He who created all things,
will restore all things. They were not, and they were created: they were, and shall they not
be restored?…“He shall deliver them from the hand of the ungodly.”
15. But perhaps thou wilt say, I lose this light. “There is sprung up a light for the right-
eous” (ver. 11). What light fearest thou thou mayest lose? fearest thou thou mayest be in
darkness? Fear not thou mayest lose light; nay, fear lest while thou art guarding against the
loss of this light, thou mayest lose that true light. For we see to whom that light is given
which thou fearest losing, and with whom it is shared. Do the righteous only see this sun,
when He maketh it rise over the just and unjust, and raineth upon the just and unjust?4486
Wicked men, robbers, the unchaste, beasts, flies, worms, see that light together with thee.
What sort of light doth He keep for the righteous, who giveth this even to such as these?
Deservedly the Martyrs beheld this light in faith; for they who despised this light of the sun,
had some light in their eyes, which they longed for, who rejected this. Do you imagine that
they were really in misery, when they walked in chains? Spacious was the prison to the
faithful, light were the chains to the confessors. They who preached Christ amid their tor-
ments, had joy in the iron-chair. What light hath sprung up for the righteous? Not that
which springeth up for the unrighteous; not that which He causeth to rise over the good
and bad. There is a different light which springeth up to the righteous; of which light, that
never rose upon themselves, the unrighteous shall in the end say, “Therefore have we erred
from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined upon us, and the sun
of righteousness rose not upon us.”4487 Behold, by loving this sun they have lain in the
darkness of the heart. What did it profit them to have seen with their eyes this sun, and not
in mind to have seen that light? Tobit was blind, but he used to teach his son the way of
God. Ye know this, that Tobit warned his son, and said to him, “Son, give alms of thy sub-
stance; because that alms suffer not to come into darkness.”4488 Even he who was in darkness
spoke thus.…Dost thou wish to know that light? Be true-hearted. What is, be true-hearted?
Be not of a crooked heart before God, withstanding His will, and wishing to bend Him unto
thee, and not to rule thyself to please Him; and thou wilt feel the joyful gladness which all
the true-hearted know.

Psalm XCVII
16. “Be glad, ye righteous” (ver. 12). Perhaps already the faithful hearing the word, “Be
glad,” are thinking of banquets, preparing cups, waiting for the season of roses; because it
is said, “Be glad, ye righteous!” See what followeth, “Be glad in the Lord.” Thou art waiting
for the season of spring, that thou mayest be glad: thou hast the Lord for joyful gladness,
the Lord is always with thee, He hath no special season; thou hast Him by night, thou hast
Him by day. Be true-hearted; and thou hast ever joy from Him. For that joy which is after
the fashion of the world, is not true joy. Hear the prophet Isaiah: “There is no joy, saith my
God, to the wicked.”4489 What the wicked call joy is not joy, such as he knew who made no
account of their joy: let us believe him, brethren. He was a man, but he knew both kinds of
joy. He certainly knew the joys of the cup, for he was a man, he knew the joy of the table,
he knew the joys of marriage, he knew those joys worldly and luxurious. He who knew them
saith with confidence, “There is no joy to the wicked, saith the Lord.” But it is not man who
speaks, it is the Lord.…But thou sayest, I see not that light which Isaiah saw. Believe, and
thou shalt see it. For perhaps thou hast not the eye to see it; for it is an eye by which that
beauty is discerned. For as there is an eye of the flesh, by means of which this light is seen:
so there is an eye of the heart, by which that joy is perceived: perhaps that eye is wounded,
dimmed, disturbed by passion, by avarice, by indulgence, by senseless lust; thine eye is dis-
turbed: thou canst not see that light. Believe, before thou seest: thou shalt be healed, and
shalt see.
17. “And confess to the remembrance of His holiness.” Now made glad, now rejoicing
in the Lord, confess unto Him; for unless it were His will, ye would not rejoice in Him. For
the Lord Himself saith: “These things I have spoken to you: that in Me ye might have peace.
But in the world ye shall have tribulation.”4490 If ye are Christians, look for tribulations in
this world; look not for more peaceful and better times. Brethren, ye deceive yourselves;
what the Gospel doth not promise you, promise not to yourselves. Ye know what the Gospel
saith; we are speaking to Christians; we ought not to disobey the faith. The Gospel saith this,
that in the last times many evils, many stumbling-blocks, many tribulations, much iniquity,
shall abound; but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.4491 “The love,”
it saith, “of many shall wax cold.” Whosoever then hath been stedfastly fervent in spirit, as
the Apostle saith, “fervent in spirit,”4492 his love shall not wax cold: because “the love of
God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.”4493 Let no
man therefore promise himself what the Gospel doth not promise. Behold, happier times

will come, and I am doing this, and purchasing this. It is good for thee to listen to Him who
is not deceived, nor hath deceived any man, who promised thee joy not here, but in Himself;
and when all here hath passed away, to hope that with Him thou wilt for ever reign; lest
when thou dost wish to reign here, thou mayest neither enjoy gladness here, nor find it
there.
Psalm XCVII
Psalm XCVIII.4494
1. “O sing unto the Lord a new song” (ver. 1). The new man knoweth this, the old man
knoweth it not. The old man is the old life, and the new man the new life: the old life is de-
rived from Adam, the new life is formed in Christ. But in this Psalm, the whole world is
enjoined to sing a new song. More openly elsewhere the words are these: “O sing unto the
Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth;” 4495 that they who cut themselves
off from the communion of the whole earth,4496 may understand that they cannot sing the
new song, because it is sung in the whole, and not in a part of it. Attend here also, and see
that this is said. And when the whole earth is enjoined to sing a new song, it is meant, that
peace singeth a new song. “For He hath done marvelous things.” What marvelous things?
Behold, the Gospel was just now being read, and we heard the marvellous things of the Lord.
The only son of his mother, who was a widow, was being carried out dead: the Lord, in
compassion, made them stand still; they laid him down, and the Lord said, “Young man, I
say unto thee, Arise.”4497…“The Lord hath done marvellous things.” What marvellous
things? Hear: “His own right hand, and His holy arm, hath healed for Him.” What is the
Lord’s holy Arm? Our Lord Jesus Christ. Hear Isaiah: “Who hath believed our report, and
to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?”4498 His holy arm then, and His own right hand,
is Himself. Our Lord Jesus Christ is therefore the arm of God, and the right hand of God;
for this reason is it said, “hath He healed for Him.” It is not said only, “His right hand hath
healed the world,” but “hath healed for Him.” For many are healed for themselves, not for
Him. Behold how many long for that bodily health, and receive it from Him: they are healed
by Him, but not for Him. How are they healed by Him, and not for Him? When they have
received health, they become wanton: they who when sick were chaste, when cured become
adulterers: they who when in illness injured no man, on the recovery of their strength attack
and crush the innocent: they are healed, but not unto Him. Who is he who is healed unto
Him? He who is healed inwardly. Who is he that is healed inwardly? He who trusteth in
Him, that when he shall have been healed inwardly, reformed into a new man, afterwards
this mortal flesh too, which doth languish for a time, may in the end itself even recover its
most perfect health. Let us therefore be healed for Him. But that we may be healed for Him,
let us believe in His right hand.
2. “The Lord hath made known His salvation” (ver. 2). This very right hand, this very
arm, this very salvation, is our Lord Jesus Christ of whom it is said, “And all flesh shall see

the salvation of God;”4499 of whom also that Simeon who embraced the Infant in his arms,
spoke, “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation.”4500 “The Lord hath made known His salvation.” To whom did He make it known?
To a part, or to the whole? Not to any part specially. Let no man betray, no man deceive,
no man say, “Lo, here is Christ, or there:”4501 the man who saith, Lo, He is here, or there,
pointeth to some particular spots. To whom “hath the Lord declared His salvation”? Hear
what followeth: “His righteousness hath He openly showed in the sight of the heathen.” Our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is the right hand of God, the arm of God, the salvation of
God, and the righteousness of God.
3. “He hath remembered His mercy to Jacob, and His truth unto the house of Israel”
(ver. 3). What meaneth this, “He hath remembered His mercy and truth”? He hath pitied,
so that He promised; because He promised and showed His mercy, truth hath followed:
mercy hath gone before promise, promise hath been fulfilled in truth.…
“And His truth unto the house of Israel.” Who is this Israel? That ye may not perchance
think of one nation of the Jews, hear what followeth: “All the ends of the world have seen
the salvation of our God.” It is not said, all the earth: but, “all the ends of the world:” as it is
said, from one end to the other. Let no man cut this down, let no man scatter it abroad;
strong is the unity of Christ. He who gave so great a price, hath bought the whole: “All the
ends of the world.”
4. Because they have seen, then, “Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands” (ver.
4). Ye already know what it is to make a joyful noise. Rejoice, and speak. If ye cannot express
your joy, shout ye; let the shout manifest your joy, if your speech cannot: yet let not joy be
mute; let not your heart be silent respecting its God, let it not be mute concerning His gifts.
If thou speakest to thyself, unto thyself art thou healed; if His right hand hath healed thee
for Him, speak thou unto Him for whom thou hast been healed. “Sing, rejoice, and make
melody.”
5. “Make melody unto the Lord upon the harp: on the harp and with the voice of a
Psalm” (ver. 5). Praise Him not with the voice only; take up works, that ye may not only
sing, but work also. He who singeth and worketh, maketh melody with psaltery and upon
the harp. Now see what sort of instruments are next spoken of, in figure: “With ductile
trumpets also, and the sound of the pipe of horn” (ver. 6). What are ductile trumpets, and
pipes of horn? Ductile trumpets are of brass: they are drawn out by hammering; if by ham-
mering, by being beaten, ye shall be ductile trumpets, drawn out unto the praise of God, if
ye improve when in tribulation: tribulation is hammering, improvement is the being drawn
4499 Luke iii. 6.
4500 Luke ii. 28–30.
4501 Matt. xxiv. 23.
Psalm XCVIII
out. Job was a ductile trumpet, when suddenly assailed by the heaviest losses, and the death
of his sons, become like a ductile trumpet by the beating of so heavy tribulation, he sounded
thus: “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.”4502
How did he sound? How pleasantly doth his voice sound? This ductile trumpet is still under
the hammer.…We have heard how he was hammered; let us hear how he soundeth: let us,
if it please you, hear the sweet sound of this ductile trumpet: “What! shall we receive good
at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” O courageous, O sweet sound! whom
will not that sound awake from sleep? whom will not confidence in God awake, to march
to battle fearlessly against the devil; not to struggle with his own strength, but His who
proveth him. For He it is who hammereth: for the hammer could not do so of itself.…See
how (I dare so speak, my brethren) even the Apostle was beaten with this very hammer: he
saith, “there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet me.”4503
Behold he is under the hammer: let us hear how he speaketh of it: “For this thing,” he saith,
“I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace
is sufficient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” I, saith His Maker, wish
to make this trumpet perfect; I cannot do so unless I hammer it; in weakness is strength
made perfect. Hear now the ductile trumpet itself sounding as it should: “When I am weak,
then am I strong.”…
6. The voice of the pipe of horn, what is it? The horn riseth above the flesh: in rising
above the flesh it needs must be solid so as to last, and able to speak. And whence this? Be-
cause it hath surpassed the flesh. He who wisheth to be a horn trumpet, let him overcome
the flesh. What meaneth this, let him overcome the flesh? Let him surpass the desires, let
him conquer the lusts of the flesh. Hear the horn trumpets.…What meaneth this, “Set your
affection on things above”? It meaneth, Rise above the flesh, think not of carnal things. They
were not yet horn trumpets, to whom he now spoke thus: “I could not speak unto you,
brethren, as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you
with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it: neither yet now are
ye able. For ye are yet carnal.”4504 They were not therefore horn trumpets, because they had
not risen above the flesh. Horn both adhereth to the flesh, and riseth above the flesh; and
although it springeth from the flesh, yet it surpasseth it. If therefore thou art spiritual, when
before thou wast carnal; as yet thou art treading the earth in the flesh, but in spirit thou art
rising into heaven; for though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh.…Brethren,
do not reproach brethren whom the mercy of God hath not yet converted; know that as
long as ye do this, ye savour of the flesh. That is not a trumpet which pleaseth the ears of

Psalm XCVIII
God: the trumpet of boastfulness maketh the war fruitless. Let the horn trumpet raise thy
courage against the devil; let not the fleshly trumpet raise thy pride against thy brother.
“Make a joyful noise in the sight of the Lord the King.”
7. While ye are rejoicing, and delighted with the ductile trumpets, and the voice of the
horn, what followeth? “Let the sea be stirred up, and the fulness thereof” (ver. 7). Brethren,
when the Apostles, like ductile trumpets and horns, were preaching the truth, the sea was
stirred up, its waves arose, tempests increased, persecutions of the Church took place.
Whence hath the sea been stirred up? When a joyful noise was made, when Psalms of
thanksgiving were being sung before God: the ears of God were pleased, the waves of the
sea were raised. “Let the sea be stirred up, and the fulness thereof: the round world, and all
that dwell therein.” Let the sea be stirred up in its persecutions. “Let the floods clap their
hands together” (ver. 8). Let the sea be aroused, and the floods clap their hands together;
persecutions arise, and the saints rejoice in God. Whence shall the floods clap their hands?
What is to clap their hands? To rejoice in works. To clap hands, is to rejoice; hands, mean
works. What floods? Those whom God hath made floods, by giving them that Water, the
Holy Spirit. “If any man thirst,” saith He, “let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth
on Me, out of his bosom shall flow rivers of living water.”4505 These rivers clapped their
hands, these rivers rejoiced in works, and blessed God. “The hills shall be joyful together.”
8. “Before the Lord, for He is come; for He is come to judge the earth” (ver. 9). “The
hills” signify the great. The Lord cometh to judge the earth, and they rejoice. But there are
hills, who, when the Lord is coming to judge the earth, shall tremble. There are therefore
good and evil hills; the good hills, are spiritual greatness; the bad hills, are the swelling of
pride. “Let the hills be joyful together before the Lord, for He is come; for He is come to
judge the earth.” Wherefore shall He come, and how shall He come? “With righteousness
shall He judge the world, and the people with equity” (ver. 10). Let the hills therefore rejoice;
for He shall not judge unrighteously. When some man is coming as a judge, to whom the
conscience cannot lie open, even innocent men may tremble, if from him they expect a reward
for virtue, or fear the penalty of condemnation; when He shall come who cannot be deceived,
let the hills rejoice, let them rejoice fearlessly; they shall be enlightened by Him, not con-
demned; let them rejoice, because the Lord will come to judge the world with equity; and
if the righteous hills rejoice, let the unrighteous tremble. But behold, He hath not yet come:
what need is there they should tremble? Let them mend their ways, and rejoice. It is in thy
power in what way thou willest to await the coming of Christ. For this reason He delayeth
to come, that when He cometh He may not condemn thee. Lo, He hath not yet come: He
is in heaven, thou on earth: He delayeth His coming, do not thou delay wisdom. His coming
4505 John vii. 37–39.
Psalm XCVIII
is hard to the hard of heart, soft to the pious. See therefore even now what thou art: if hard
of heart, thou canst soften; if thou art soft, even now rejoice that He will come. For thou art
a Christian. Yea, thou sayest. I believe that thou prayest, and sayest, “Thy kingdom come.”4506
Thou desirest Him to come, whose coming thou fearest. Reform thyself, that thou mayest
not pray against thyself.
4506 Matt. vi. 10.
Psalm XCVIII
Psalm XCIX.4507
1. Beloved brethren, it ought already to be known to you, as sons of the Church, and
well instructed in the school of Christ through all the books of our ancient fathers, who
wrote the words of God and the great things of God, that their wish was to consult for our
good, who were to live at this period, believers in Christ; who, at a seasonable time came
unto us, the first time, in humility; at the second, destined to come in exaltation.…For thus
it is said in the Psalms: “Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked
down from heaven.”4508 Now, therefore, our whole design is, when we hear a Psalm, a
Prophet, or the Law, all of which was written before our Lord Jesus Christ came in the flesh,
to see Christ there, to understand Christ there. Attend therefore, beloved, to this Psalm,
with me, and let us herein seek Christ; certainly He will appear to those who seek Him, who
at first appeared to those who sought Him not; and He will not desert those who long for
Him, who redeemed those who neglected Him. Behold, the Psalm beginneth concerning
Him: of Him it is said:—
2. “The Lord is King, be the people angry” (ver. 1). For our Lord Jesus Christ began to
reign, began to be preached, after He arose from the dead and ascended into heaven, after
He had filled His disciples with the confidence of the Holy Spirit, that they should not fear
death, which He had already killed in Himself. Our Lord Christ began then to be preached,
that they who wished for salvation might believe in Him; and the peoples who worshipped
idols were angry. They who worshipped what they had made were angry, because He by
whom they were made was declared. He announced, in fact, through His disciples, Himself,
who wished them to be converted unto Him by whom they were made, and to be turned
away from those things which they had made themselves. They were angry with their Lord
in behalf of their idols, they who even if they were angry with their slave on their idol’s ac-
count, were to be condemned. For their slave was better than their idol: for God made their
slave, the carpenter made their idol. They were so angry in their idol’s behalf, that they
feared not to be angry with their Lord. But the words, “be they angry,” are a prediction, not
a command; for in a prophecy it is that this is said, “The Lord is King, be the people angry.”
Some good resulteth even from the enraged people: let them be angry, and in their anger
let the Martyrs be crowned.…Ye heard when Jeremiah was being read before the reading
of the Apostle,4509 if ye listened; ye saw therein the times in which we now live. He said,
“The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, let them perish from the earth,
and from under the heaven.”4510 He said not, The gods that have not made the heavens and

earth, let them perish from the heaven and from the earth; because they never were in
heaven: but what did he say? “Let them perish from the earth, and from under the heaven.”
As if, while the word earth was repeated, the repetition of the word heaven were wanting
(because they never were in heaven): he repeateth the earth twice, since it is under heaven.
“Let them perish from the earth, and from under the heaven,” from their temples. Consider
if this be not now taking place; if in a great measure it hath not already happened: for what,
or how much, hath remained? The idols remained rather in the hearts of the pagans, than
in the niches of the temples.
3. “He who sitteth between the cherubims:” thou dost understand, “He is King: let the
earth be stirred up.”…The Cherubim is the seat of God, as the Scripture showeth us, a certain
exalted heavenly throne, which we see not; but the Word of God knoweth it, knoweth it as
His own seat: and the Word of God and the Spirit of God hath Itself revealed to the servants
of God where God sitteth. Not that God doth sit, as doth man; but thou, if thou dost wish
that God sit in thee, if thou wilt be good, shalt be the seat of God; for thus is it written, “The
soul of the righteous is the seat of wisdom.”4511 For a throne is in our language called a seat.
For some, conversant with the Hebrew tongue, have interpreted cherubim in the Latin
language (for it is a Hebrew term) by the words, fulness of knowledge. Therefore, because
God surpasseth all knowledge, He is said to sit above the fulness of knowledge. Let there be
therefore in thee fulness of knowledge, and even thou shalt be the throne of God.…He
knoweth all things: for our hairs are numbered before God. 4512 But the fulness of knowledge
which He willed man to know is different from this; the knowledge which He willed thee
to have, pertaineth to the law of God. And who can, thou mayest perhaps say unto me,
perfectly know the Law, so that he may have within himself the fulness of the knowledge of
the Law, and be able to be the seat of God? Be not disturbed; it is briefly told thee what thou
hast, if thou dost wish to have the fulness of knowledge, and to become the throne of God:
for the Apostle saith, “Love is the fulfilling of the Law.”4513 What followeth then? Thou hast
lost the whole of thine excuse. Ask thine heart; see whether it hath love. If there be love
there, there is the fulfilment of the Law there also; already God dwelleth in thee, thou hast
become the throne of God. “Be the people angry;” what can the angry people do against him
who hath become the throne of God? Thou givest heed unto them who rage against thee:
Who is it that sitteth within thee, thou givest not heed. Thou art become a heaven, and
fearest thou the earth? For the Scripture saith in another passage, that the Lord our God
doth declare, “The heaven is My throne.”4514 If therefore even thou by having the fulness
4511 Prov. xii. 23.
4512 Matt. x. 30.
4513 Rom. xiii. 10.
4514 Isa. lxvi. 1.
Psalm XCIX
of knowledge, and by having love, hast been made the throne of God, thou hast become a
heaven. For this heaven which we look up to with these eyes of ours, is not very precious
before God. Holy souls are the heaven of God; the minds of the Angels, and all the minds
of His servants, are the heaven of God.
4. “The Lord is great in Sion, and high above all people” (ver. 2).…He whom I spoke to
thee of as above the Cherubims, is great in Sion. Ask thou now, what is Sion? We know Sion
to be the city of God. The city of Jerusalem is called Sion; and is so called according to a
certain interpretation, for that Sion signifieth watching, that is, sight and contemplation;
for to watch is to look forward to, or gaze upon, or strain the eyes to see. Now every soul is
a Sion, if it trieth to see that light which is to be seen. For if it shall have gazed upon a light
of its own, it is darkened; if upon His, it is enlightened. But, now that it is clear that Sion is
the city of God; what is the city of God, but the Holy Church? For men who love one another,
and who love their God who dwelleth in them, constitute a city unto God. Because a city is
held together by some law; their very law is Love; and that very Love is God: for openly it
is written, “God is Love.”4515 He therefore who is full of Love, is full of God; and many, full
of love, constitute a city full of God. That city of God is called Sion; the Church therefore is
Sion. In it God is great.…
5. Do ye imagine, brethren, that they whose instruments re-echoed yesterday, are not
angry with our fastings? But let us not be angry with them, but let us fast for them. For the
Lord our God who sitteth in us hath said, He hath Himself commanded us to pray for our
enemies, to pray for them that persecute us:4516 and as the Church doth this, the persecutors
are almost extinct.…The drunken man doth not offend himself, but he offendeth the sober
man. Show me a man who is at last happy in God, liveth gravely, sigheth for that everlasting
peace which God hath promised him; and see that when he hath seen a man dancing to an
instrument, he is more grieved for his madness, than for a man who is in a frenzy from a
fever. If then we know their evils, considering that we also have been freed from those very
evils, let us grieve for them; and if we grieve for them, let us pray for them; and that we may
be heard, let us fast for them. For we do not keep our own fasts in their holidays. Different
are the fasts which we celebrate through the days of the approaching Passover, through
different seasons which are fixed for us in Christ: but through their holidays we fast for this
reason, that when they are rejoicing, we may groan for them. For by their joy they excite
our grief, and cause us to remember how wretched they are as yet. But since we see many
freed thence, where we also have been, we ought not to despair even of them. And if they
are still enraged, let us pray; and if still a particle of earth that hath remained behind be
stirred up against us, let us continue in lamentation for them, that to them also God may
4515 1 John iv. 8.
4516 Matt. v. 44.
Psalm XCIX
grant understanding, and that with us they may hear those words, in which we are at this
moment rejoicing.
6. All these very people, over whom Thou art great in Sion, “Let them confess unto Thy
Name, which is great” (ver. 3). Thy Name was little when they were enraged: it hath become
great; let them now confess. In what sense do we say, that the Name of Christ was little, before
it was spread abroad to so great an extent? Because His report is meant by His Name. His
Name was small; already it hath become great. What nation is there that hath not heard of
the Name of Christ? Therefore let now the people confess unto Thy Name, which is great,
who before were enraged with Thy little Name. Wherefore shall they confess? Because it is
“wonderful and holy.” Thy very Name is wonderful and holy. He is so preached as crucified,
so preached as humbled, so preached as judged, that He may come exalted, that He may
come living, that He may come to judge in power. He spareth at present the people who
blaspheme Him, because “the long-suffering of God leadeth to repentance.”4517 For He who
now spareth, will not always spare: nor will He, who is now being preached that He may be
feared, fail to come to judge. He will come, my brethren, He will come: let us fear Him, and
let us live so that we may be found on His right hand. For He will come, and will judge, so
as to place some on the left hand, some on the right.4518 And He doth not act in an uncertain
manner, so as to err perchance betwixt men, so that he who should be set on the right hand,
be set on the left; or that he who ought to stand on the left, by a mistake of God should stand
on the right: He cannot err, so as to place the evil where He ought to set the good; nor to
place the good, where He should have set the evil. If He cannot err, we err, if we fear not;
but if we have feared in this life, we shall not then have what to fear for. “For the King’s
honour loveth judgment.”…
7. “Thou hast prepared equity; Thou hast wrought judgment and righteousness in Jacob.”
For we too ought to have judgment, we ought to have righteousness; but He worketh in us
judgment and righteousness, who created us in whom He might work them. How ought
we too to have judgment and righteousness? Thou hast judgment, when thou dost distinguish
evil from good: and righteousness when thou followest the good, and turnest aside from
the evil. By distinguishing them, thou hast judgment; by doing, thou hast righteousness.
“Eschew evil,” he saith, “and do good; seek peace, and ensue it.”4519 Thou shouldest first
have judgment, then righteousness. What judgment? That thou mayest first judge what is
evil, and what is good. And what righteousness? That thou mayest shun evil, and do good.
But this thou wilt not gain from thyself; see what he hath said, “Thou hast wrought judgment
and righteousness in Jacob.”

Psalm XCIX
8. “O magnify the Lord our God” (ver. 5). Magnify Him truly, magnify Him well. Let
us praise Him, let us magnify Him who hath wrought the very righteousness which we have;
who wrought it in us, Himself. For who but He who justified us, wrought righteousness in
us? For of Christ it is said, “who justifieth the ungodly.”4520…“And fall down before4521
His footstool: for He is holy.” What are we to fall down before? His footstool. What is under
the feet is called a footstool, in Greek ὑποπόδιον, in Latin Scabellum or Suppedaneum. But
consider, brethren, what he commandeth us to fall down before. In another passage of the
Scriptures it is said, “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool.” 4522 Doth he
then bid us worship the earth, since in another passage it is said, that it is God’s footstool?
How then shall we worship the earth, when the Scripture saith openly, “Thou shalt worship
the Lord thy God”?4523 Yet here it saith, “fall down before His footstool:” and, explaining
to us what His footstool is, it saith, “The earth is My footstool.” I am in doubt; I fear to
worship the earth, lest He who made the heaven and the earth condemn me; again, I fear
not to worship the footstool of my Lord, because the Psalm biddeth me, “fall down before
His footstool.” I ask, what is His footstool? and the Scripture telleth me, “the earth is My
footstool.” In hesitation I turn unto Christ, since I am herein seeking Himself: and I discover
how the earth may be worshipped without impiety,4524 how His footstool may be worshipped
without impiety. For He took upon Him earth from earth; because flesh is from earth, and
He received flesh from the flesh of Mary. And because He walked here in very flesh, and
gave that very flesh to us to eat for our salvation; and no one eateth that flesh, unless he hath
first worshipped: we have found out in what sense such a footstool of our Lord’s may be
worshipped, and not only that we sin not in worshipping it, but that we sin in not worship-
ping. But doth the flesh give life? Our Lord Himself, when He was speaking in praise of this
same earth, said, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.”…But when
our Lord praised it, He was speaking of His own flesh, and He had said, “Except a man eat
My flesh, he shall have no life in him.”4525 Some disciples of His, about seventy,4526 were
offended, and said, “This is an hard saying, who can hear it?” And they went back, and
walked no more with Him. It seemed unto them hard that He said, “Except ye eat the flesh
of the Son of Man, ye have no life in you:” they received it foolishly, they thought of it car-

nally, and imagined that the Lord would cut off parts from His body, and give unto them;
and they said, “This is a hard saying.” It was they who were hard, not the saying; for unless
they had been hard, and not meek, they would have said unto themselves, He saith not this
without reason, but there must be some latent mystery herein. They would have remained
with Him, softened, not hard: and would have learnt that from Him which they who re-
mained, when the others departed, learnt. For when twelve disciples had remained with
Him, on their departure, these remaining followers suggested to Him, as if in grief for the
death of the former, that they were offended by His words, and turned back. But He instructed
them, and saith unto them, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth, but the flesh profiteth nothing;
the words that I have spoken unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”4527 Understand
spiritually what I have said; ye are not to eat this body which ye see; nor to drink that blood
which they who will crucify Me shall pour forth. I have commended unto you a certain
mystery; spiritually understood, it will quicken. Although it is needful that this be visibly
celebrated, yet it must be spiritually understood.4528
9. “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among such as call upon His Name:
these called upon the Lord, and He heard them” (ver. 6). “He spake unto them out of the
cloudy pillar” (ver. 7).…Of Moses it is not there stated that he was a priest. But if he was
not this, what was he? Could he be anything greater than a priest? This Psalm declareth that
he also was himself a priest: “Moses and Aaron among His priests.” They therefore were
the Lord’s priests. Samuel is read of later in the Book of Kings: this Samuel is in David’s
times; for he anointed the holy David. Samuel from his infancy grew up in the temple.…He
mentioneth these: and by these desireth us to understand all the saints. Yet why hath he
here named those? Because we said that we ought here to understand Christ. Attend, holy
brethren. He said above, “O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before His footstool,
for He is holy:” praising some one, that is, our Lord Jesus Christ; whose footstool is to be
worshipped, because He assumed flesh, in which He was to appear before the human race;
and wishing to show unto us that the ancient fathers also had preached of Him, because our
Lord Jesus Christ is Himself the True Priest, he mentioned these, because God spake unto
them out of the cloudy pillar. What meaneth, “out of the cloudy pillar”? He was speaking
figuratively. For if He spoke in some cloud, those obscure words predicted some one un-
known, yet to be manifest. This unknown one is no longer unknown; for He is known by
us, our Lord Jesus Christ.…He who first spoke out of the cloudy pillar, hath in Person spoken
unto us in His footstool; that is, on earth, when He had assumed the flesh, for which reason
we worship His footstool, for He is holy. He Himself used to speak out of the cloud, which

Psalm XCIX
was not then understood: He hath spoken in His own footstool, and the words of His cloud
have been understood. “They kept His testimonies, and the law that He gave them.”…“Thou
heardest them,” he saith, “O Lord our God: Thou wast forgiving to them, O God” (ver. 8).
God is not said to be forgiving toward anything but sins: when He pardoneth sins, then He
forgiveth. And what had He in them to punish, so that He was forgiving in pardoning them?
He was forgiving in pardoning their sins, He was also forgiving in punishing them. For what
followeth? “And punishedst all their own affections.” Even in punishing them Thou wast
forgiving toward them: for not in remitting, but also in punishing their sins, hast Thou been
forgiving. Consider, my brethren, what he hath taught us here: attend. God is angry with
him whom, when he sinneth, He scourgeth not: for unto him to whom He is truly forgiving,
He not only remitteth sins, that they may not injure him in a future life; but also chasteneth
him, that he delight not in continual sin.
10. Come, my brethren; if we ask how these were punished, the Lord will aid me to tell
you. Let us consider these three persons, Moses, Aaron, and Samuel: and how they were
punished, since he said, “Thou hast punished all their own affections:” meaning those affec-
tions of theirs, which the Lord knew in their hearts, which men knew not. For they were
living in the midst of the people of God, without complaint from man. But what do we say?
That perhaps the early life of Moses was sinful; for he fled from Egypt, after slaying a man.4529
The early life of Aaron also was such as would displease God; for he allowed a maddened
and infatuated people to make an idol to worship;4530 and an idol was made for God’s people
to worship. What sin did Samuel, who was given up when an infant to the temple? He passed
all his life amid the holy sacraments of God: from childhood the servant of God. Nothing
was ever said of Samuel, nothing by men. Perhaps God knew of somewhat there to chasten;
since even what seemeth perfect unto men, unto that Perfection is still imperfect. Artists
show many of their works to the unskilful; and when the unskilful have pronounced them
perfect, the artists polish them still further, as they know what is still wanting to them, so
that men wonder at things they had imagined already perfect having received so much ad-
ditional polish. This happeneth in buildings, and in paintings, and in embroidery, and almost
in every species of art. At first they judge it to be already in a manner perfect, so that their
eyes desire nothing further: but the judgment of the inexperienced eye is one, and that of
the rule of art another. Thus also these Saints were living before the eyes of God, as if faultless,
as if perfect, as if Angels: but He who punished all their own affections, knew what was
wanting in them. But He punished them not in anger, but in mercy: He punished them that
He might perfect what He had begun, not to condemn what He had cast away. God therefore
4529 Exod. ii. 12–15.
4530 Exod. xxxii. 1–4.
Psalm XCIX
punished all their affections. How did He punish Samuel? where is this punishment?…What
was said unto Moses was a type, not a punishment. What punishment is death to an old
man? What punishment was it, not to enter into that land, into which unworthy men entered?
But what is said of Aaron? He also died an old man: his sons succeeded him in the priesthood:
his son afterwards ruled in the priesthood: how did He punish Aaron also?4531 Samuel also
died a holy old man, leaving his sons as his successors.4532 I seek for the punishment inflicted
upon them, and according to men I find it not: but according to what I know the servants
of God suffer every day, they were day by day punished. Read ye, and see the punishments,
and ye also who are advanced bear the punishments. Every day they suffered from the ob-
stinate people, every day they suffered from the ungodly livers; and were compelled to live
among those whose lives they daily censured. This was their punishment. He unto whom
it is small hath not advanced far; for the ungodliness of others tormenteth thee in proportion
as thou hast departed far from thine own.…
11. “O magnify the Lord our God!” (ver. 9). Again we magnify Him. He who is merciful
even when He striketh, how is He to be praised, how is He to be magnified? Canst thou
show this unto thy son, and cannot God? For thou art not good when thou dost caress thy
son, and evil when thou strikest him. Both when thou dost caress him thou art a father, and
when thou strikest him, thou art his father: thou dost caress him, that he may not faint; thou
strikest him, that he may not perish. “O magnify the Lord our God, and worship Him upon
His holy hill: for the Lord our God is holy.” As he said above, “O magnify the Lord our God
and fall down before His footstool:”4533 now we have understood what it is to worship His
footstool: thus also but now after he had magnified the Lord our God, that no man might
magnify Him apart from His hill, he hath also praised His hill. What is His hill? We read
elsewhere concerning this hill, that a stone was cut from the hill without hands, and shattered
all the kingdoms of the earth, and the stone itself increased. This is the vision of Daniel
which I am relating. This stone which was cut from the hill without hands increased, and
“became,” he saith, “a great mountain, and filled the whole face of the earth.”4534 Let us
worship on that great mountain, if we desire to be heard. Heretics4535 do not worship on
that mountain, because it hath filled the whole earth; they have stuck fast on part of it, and
have lost the whole. If they acknowledge the Catholic Church, they will worship on this hill
with us. For we already see how that stone that was cut from the mountain without hands
hath increased, and how great tracts of earth it hath prevailed over, and unto what nations

it hath extended. What is the mountain whence the stone was hewn without hands? The
Jewish kingdom, in the first place; since they worshipped one God. Thence was hewn the
stone, our Lord Jesus Christ.…That stone then was born of the mountain without hands:
it increased, and by its increase broke all the kingdoms of the earth. It hath become a great
mountain, and hath filled the whole face of the earth. This is the Catholic Church, in whose
communion rejoice that ye are. But they who are not in her communion, since they worship
and praise God apart from this same mountain, are not heard unto eternal life; although
they may be heard unto certain temporal things. Let them not flatter themselves, because
God heareth them in some things: for He heareth Pagans also in some things. Do not the
Pagans cry unto God, and it raineth? Wherefore? Because He maketh His sun to rise over
the good and the bad, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust.4536 Boast not therefore,
Pagan, that when thou criest unto God, God sendeth rain, for He sendeth rain upon the just
and the unjust. He hath heard thee in temporal things: He heareth thee not in things eternal,
unless thou hast worshipped in His holy hill. “Worship Him upon His holy hill: for the Lord
our God is holy.”…

Psalm XCIX
Psalm C.4537
1. Ye heard the Psalm, brethren, while it was being chanted: it is short, and not obscure:
as if I had given you an assurance, that ye should not fear fatigue.…
2. The title of this Psalm is, “A Psalm of confession.” The verses are few, but big with
great subjects; may the seed bring forth within your hearts, the barn be prepared for the
Lord’s harvest.
3. “Jubilate,” therefore, “unto the Lord, all ye lands” (ver. 1). This Psalm giveth this ex-
hortation to us, that we jubilate unto the Lord. Nor doth it, as it were, exhort one particular
corner of the earth, or one habitation or congregation of men; but since it is aware that it
hath sown blessings on every side, on every side it doth exact jubilance. Doth all the earth
at this moment hear my voice? And yet the whole earth hath heard this voice. All the earth
is already jubilant in the Lord; and what is not as yet jubilant, will be so. For blessing, extend-
ing on every side, when the Church was commencing to spread from Jerusalem throughout
all nations,4538 everywhere overturneth ungodliness, and everywhere buildeth up piety: the
good are mingled with the wicked throughout all lands. Every land is full of the discontented
murmurs of the wicked, and of the jubilance of the good. What then is it, “to jubilate”? For
the title of the present Psalm especially maketh us give good heed to this word, for it is en-
titled, “A Psalm of confession.” What meaneth, to jubilate with confession? It is the sentiment
thus expressed in another Psalm: “Blessed is the people that understandeth jubilance.” Surely
that which being understood maketh blessed is something great. May therefore the Lord
our God, who maketh men blessed, grant me to understand what to say, and grant you to
understand what ye hear: “Blessed is the people that understandeth jubilance.”4539 Let us
therefore run unto this blessing, let us understand jubilance, let us not pour it forth without
understanding. Of what use is it to be jubilant and obey4540 this Psalm, when it saith, “Jubilate
unto the Lord, all ye lands,” and not to understand what jubilance is, so that our voice only
may be jubilant, our heart not so? For the understanding is the utterance of the heart.4541
4. I am about to say what ye know. One who jubilates, uttereth not words, but it is a
certain sound of joy without words: for it is the expression of a mind poured forth in joy,
expressing, as far as it is able, the affection, but not compassing the feeling. A man rejoicing
in his own exultation, after certain words which cannot4542 be uttered or understood,

Psalm C
bursteth forth into sounds of exultation without words, so that it seemeth that he indeed
doth rejoice with his voice itself, but as if filled with excessive joy cannot express in words
the subject of that joy.…Those who are engaged at work in the fields are most given to ju-
bilate; reapers, or vintagers, or those who gather any of the fruits of the earth, delighted with
the abundant produce, and rejoicing in the very richness and exuberance of the soil, sing
in exultation; and among the songs which they utter in words, they put in certain cries
without words in the exultation of a rejoicing mind; and this is what is meant by jubilat-
ing.4543…
5. When then are we jubilant? When we praise that which cannot be uttered. For we
observe the whole creation, the earth and the sea, and all things that therein are: we observe
that each have their sources and causes, the power of production, the order of birth, the
limit of duration, the end in decease, that successive ages run on without any confusion,
that the stars roll, as it seemeth, from the East to the West, and complete the courses of the
years: we see how the months are measured, how the hours extend; and in all these things
a certain invisible element, I know not what, but some principle4544 of unity, which is termed
spirit or soul, present in all living things, urging them to the pursuit of pleasure and the
avoidance of pain, and the preservation of their own safety; that man also hath somewhat
in common with the Angels of God; not with cattle, such as life, hearing, sight, and so forth;
but somewhat which can understand God, which peculiarly doth belong to the mind, which
can distinguish justice and injustice, as the eye discerneth white from black. In all this con-
sideration of creation, which I have run over as I could, let the soul ask itself: Who created
all these things? Who made them? Who made among them thyself?…I have observed the
whole creation, as far as I could. I have observed the bodily creation in heaven and on earth,
and the spiritual in myself who am speaking, who animate my limbs, who exert voice, who
move the tongue, who pronounce words, and distinguish sensations. And when can I
comprehend myself in myself? How then can I comprehend what is above myself? Yet the
sight of God is promised to the human heart, and a certain operation of purifying the heart
is enjoined; this is the counsel of Scripture. Provide the means of seeing what thou lovest,
before thou try to see it. For unto whom is it not sweet to hear of God and His Name, except
to the ungodly, who is far removed, separated from Him?…
6. Be therefore like Him in piety, and earnest in meditation: for “the invisible things of
Him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made;”4545 look upon the
things that are made, admire them, seek their author. If thou art unlike, thou wilt turn back;
if like, thou wilt rejoice. And when, being like Him, thou shalt have begun to approach Him,

Psalm C
and to feel God, the more love increaseth in thee, since God is love, thou wilt perceive
somewhat which thou wast trying to say, and yet couldest not say. Before thou didst feel
God, thou didst think that thou couldest express God; thou beginnest to feel Him, and then
feelest that what thou dost feel thou canst not express. But when thou hast herein found
that what thou dost feel cannot be expressed, wilt thou be mute, wilt thou not praise God?
Wilt thou then be silent in the praises of God, and wilt thou not offer up thanksgivings unto
Him who hath willed to make Himself known unto thee? Thou didst praise Him when thou
wast seeking, wilt thou be silent when thou hast found Him? By no means; thou wilt not be
ungrateful. Honour is due to Him, reverence is due to Him, great praise is due to Him.
Consider thyself, see what thou art: earth and ashes; look who it is hath deserved to see, and
What; consider who thou art, What to see, a man to see God! I recognise not the man’s de-
serving, but the mercy of God. Praise therefore Him who hath mercy.…
7. “Serve the Lord with gladness.” All servitude is full of bitterness: all who are bound
to a lot of servitude both are slaves, and discontented. Fear not the servitude of that Lord:
there will be no groaning there, no discontent, no indignation; no one seeketh to be sold to
another master, since it is a sweet service, because we are all redeemed. Great happiness,
brethren, it is, to be a slave in that great house, although in bonds. Fear not, bound slave,
confess unto the Lord: ascribe thy bonds to thine own deservings; confess in thy chains, if
thou art desirous they be changed into ornaments.…At the same time thou art slave, and
free; slave, because thou art created such; free, because thou art loved by God, by whom
thou wast created: yea, free indeed, because thou lovest Him by whom thou wast made.
Serve not with discontent; for thy murmurs do not tend to release thee from serving, but to
make thee a wicked servant. Thou art a slave of the Lord, thou art a freedman of the Lord:
seek not so to be emancipated as to depart from the house of Him who frees thee.…
8. I will, therefore, saith he, live separate with a few good men: why should I live in
common with crowds? Well: those very few good men, from what crowds have they been
strained out? If however these few are all good: it is, nevertheless, a good and praiseworthy
design in man, to be with such as have chosen a quiet life; distant from the bustle of the
people, from noisy crowds, from the great waves of life, they are as if in harbour. Is there
therefore here that joy? that jubilant gladness which is promised? Not as yet; but still groans,
still the anxiety of temptations. For even the harbour hath an entrance somewhere or other;
if it had not, no ship could enter it; it must therefore be open on some side: but at times on
this open side the wind rusheth in; and where there are no rocks, ships dashed together
shatter one another. Where then is security, if not even in harbour? And yet it must be
confessed, it is true, that persons in harbour are in their degree much better off than when
afloat on the main. Let them love one another, as ships in harbour, let them be bound to-
gether happily; let them not dash against one another: let absolute equality be preserved
there, constancy in love; and when perchance the wind rusheth in from the open side, let
Psalm C
there be careful piloting there. Now what will one who perchance presideth over such places,
nay, who serveth his brethren, in what are called monasteries, tell me? I will be cautious: I
will admit no wicked man. How wilt thou admit no evil one?…Those who are about to
enter, do not know themselves; how much less dost thou know them? For many have
promised themselves that they were about to fulfil that holy life, which has all things in
common, where no man calleth anything his own, who have one soul and one heart in
God:4546 they have been put into the furnace, and have cracked. How then knowest thou
him who is unknown even to himself?…Where then is security? Here nowhere; in this life
nowhere, except solely in the hope of the promise of God. But there, when we shall reach
thereunto, is complete security, when the gates are shut, and the bars of the gates of Jerusalem
made fast;4547 there is truly full jubilance, and great delight. Only do not thou feel secure
in praising any sort of life: “judge no man blessed before his death.”4548
9. By this means men are deceived, so that they either do not undertake, or rashly attempt,
a better life; because, when they choose to praise, they praise without mention of the evil
that is mixed with the good: and those who choose to blame, do so with so envious and
perverse a mind, as to shut their eyes to the good, and exaggerate only the evils which either
actually exist there, or are imagined. Thus it happeneth, that when any profession hath been
ill, that is, incautiously, praised, if it hath invited men by its own reputation, they who betake
themselves thither discover some such as they did not believe to be there; and offended by
the wicked recoil from the good. Brethren, apply this teaching to your life, and hear in such
a manner that ye may live. The Church of God, to speak generally, is magnified: Christians,
and Christians alone, are called great, the Catholic (Church) is magnified; all love each
other; each and all do all they can for one another; they give themselves up to prayers, fastings,
hymns; throughout the whole world, with peaceful unanimity God is praised. Some one
perhaps heareth this, who is ignorant that nothing is said of the wicked who are mingled
with them; he cometh, invited by these praises, findeth bad men mixed with them, who were
not mentioned to him before he came; he is offended by false Christians, he flieth from true
Christians. Again, men who hate and slander them, precipitately blame them: asking, what
sort of men are Christians? Who are Christians? Covetous men, usurers. Are not the very
persons who fill the Churches on holidays the same who during the games and other spec-
tacles fill the theatres and amphitheatres? They are drunken, gluttonous, envious, slanderers
of each other. There are such, but not such only. And this slanderer in his blindness saith
nothing of the good: and that praiser in his want of caution is silent about the bad.…Thus
also in that common life of brethren, which exists in a monastery: great and holy men live

therein, with daily hymns, prayers, praises of God; their occupation is reading; they labour
with their own hands, and by this means support themselves;4549 they seek nothing covet-
ously; whatever is brought in for them by pious brethren, they use with contentedness and
charity; no one claimeth as his own what another hath not; all love, all forbear one another
mutually. Thou hast praised them; thou hast praised; he who knoweth not what is going on
within, who knoweth not how, when the wind entereth, ships even in harbour dash against
one another, entereth as if in hope of security, expecting to find no man to forbear; he find-
eth there evil brethren, who could not have been found evil, if they had not been admitted
(and they must be at first tolerated, lest they should perchance reform; nor can they easily
be excluded, unless they have first been endured): and becometh himself impatient beyond
endurance. Who asked me here? I thought that love was here. And irritated by the perversity
of some few men, since he hath not persevered in fulfilling his vow, he becometh a deserter
of so holy a design, and guilty of a vow he hath never discharged. And then, when he hath
gone forth himself too, he also becometh a reproacher, and a slanderer; and records those
things only (sometimes real), which he asserts that he could not have endured. But the real
troubles of the wicked ought to be endured for the society of the good. The Scripture saith
unto him: “Woe unto those that have lost patience.”4550 And what is more, he belcheth
abroad the evil savour of his indignation, as a means to deter them who are about to enter;
because, when he had entered himself, he could not persevere. Of what sort are they? Envious,
quarrelsome, men who forbear no man, covetous; saying, He did this there, and he did that
there. Wicked one, why art thou silent about the good! Thou sayest enough of those whom
thou couldest not endure: thou sayest nothing of those who endured thy wickedness.…
10. “O serve the Lord with gladness” (ver. 2): he addresseth you, whoever ye are who
endure all things in love, and rejoice in hope. “Serve the Lord,” not in the bitterness of
murmuring, but in the “gladness of love.” “Come before His presence with rejoicing.” It is
easy to rejoice outwardly: rejoice before the presence of God. Let not the tongue be too
joyful: let the conscience be joyful. “Come before His presence with a song.”
11. “Be ye sure that the Lord He is God” (ver. 3). Who knoweth not that the Lord, He
is God? But He speaketh of the Lord, whom men thought not God: “Be ye sure that the Lord
He is God.” Let not that Lord become vile in your sight: ye have crucified Him, scourged
Him, spit upon Him, crowned Him with thorns, clothed Him in a dress of infamy, hung
Him upon the Cross, pierced Him with nails, wounded Him with a spear, placed guards at
His tomb; He is God. “It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.” It is He that hath
made us: “and without Him was not anything made that was made.”4551 What reason have

ye for exultation, what reason have ye for pride? Another made you; the Same who made
you, suffereth from you. But ye extol yourselves, and glory in yourselves, as if ye were created
by yourselves. It is good for you that He who made you, make you perfect.…“We are His
people, and the sheep of His pasture.” Sheep and one sheep. These sheep are one sheep: and
how loving a Shepherd we have! He left the ninety and nine, and descended to seek the one,
He bringeth it back on His own shoulders4552 ransomed by His own blood. That Shepherd
dieth without fear for the sheep, who on His resurrection regaineth His sheep.
12. “Enter into His gates with confession” (ver. 3). At the gates is the beginning: begin
with confession. Thence is the Psalm entitled, “A Psalm of Confession:” there be joyful.
Confess that ye were not made by yourselves, praise Him by whom ye were made. Let thy
good come from Him, in departing from whom thou hast caused thine evil. “Enter into His
gates with confession.” Let the flock enter into the gates: let it not remain outside, a prey
for wolves. And how is it to enter? “With confession.” Let the gate, that is, the commencement
for thee, be confession. Whence it is said in another Psalm, “Begin unto the Lord with con-
fession.”4553 What he there calleth “Begin,” here he calleth “Gates.” “Enter into His gates
in confession.” What? And when we have entered, shall we not still confess? Always confess
Him: thou hast always what to confess for. It is hard in this life for a man to be so far changed,
that no cause for censure be discoverable in him: thou must needs blame thyself, lest He
who shall condemn blame thee. Therefore even when thou hast entered His courts, then
also confess. When will there be no longer confession of sins? In that rest, in that likeness
to the Angels. But consider what I have said: there will there be no confession of sins. I said
not, there will be no confession: for there will be confession of praise. Thou wilt ever confess,
that He is God, thou a creature; that He is thy Protector, thyself protected. In Him thou
shalt be as it were hid.4554 “Go into His courts with hymns; and confess unto Him.” Confess
in the gates; and when ye have entered the courts, confess with hymns. Hymn are praises.
Blame thyself, when thou art entering; when thou hast entered, praise Him. “Open me the
gates of righteousness,” he saith in another Psalm, “that I may go into them, and confess
unto the Lord.”4555 Did he say, when I have entered, I will no longer confess? Even after his
entrance, he will confess. For what sins did our Lord Jesus Christ confess, when He said, “I
confess unto Thee, O Father”?4556 He confessed in praising Him, not in accusing Himself.
“Speak good of His Name.”

13. “For the Lord is pleasant” (ver. 4). Think not that ye faint in praising Him. Your
praise of Him is like food: the more ye praise Him, the more ye acquire strength, and He
whom ye praise becometh the more sweet. “His mercy is everlasting.” For He will not cease
to be merciful, after He hath freed thee: it belongeth to His mercy to protect thee even unto
eternal life. “His mercy,” therefore, “is to everlasting: and His truth from generation to
generation” (ver. 5). Understand by “from generation to generation,” either every generation,
or in two generations, the one earthly, the other heavenly. Here there is one generation
which produceth mortals; another which maketh such as are everlasting. His Truth is both
here, and there. Imagine not that His truth is not here, if His truth were not here, he would
not say in another Psalm: “Truth is risen out of the earth;”4557 nor would Truth Itself say,
Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”4558

Psalm C
Psalm CI.4559
1. In this Psalm, we ought to seek in the whole body of it what we find in the first verse:
“Mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord” (ver. 1). Let no man flatter himself
that he will never be punished through God’s mercy; for there is judgment also; and let no
man who hath been changed for the better dread the Lord’s judgment, seeing that mercy
goeth before it. For when men judge, sometimes overcome by mercy, they act against justice;
and mercy, but not justice, seemeth to be in them: while sometimes, when they wish to en-
force a rigid judgment, they lose mercy. But God neither loseth the severity of judgment in
the bounty of mercy, nor in judging with severity loseth the bounty of mercy. Suppose we
distinguish these two, mercy and judgment, by time; for possibly, they are not placed in this
order without a meaning, so that he said not “judgment and mercy,” but “mercy and judg-
ment:” so that if we distinguish them by succession in time, perhaps we find that the present
is the season for mercy, the future for judgment. How is it that the season of mercy cometh
first? Consider first how it is with God, that thou also mayest imitate the Father, in so far
as He shall permit thee.…“He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sen-
deth rain on the just and on the unjust.” Behold mercy. When thou seest the just and the
unjust behold the same sun, enjoy the same light, drink from the same founts, satisfied with
the same rain, blessed with the same fruits of the earth, inhale this air in the same way,
possess equally the world’s goods; think not that God is unjust, who giveth these things
equally to the just and the unjust. It is the season of mercy, not as yet of judgment. For unless
God spared at first through mercy, He would not find those whom He could crown through
judgment. There is therefore a season for mercy, when the long-suffering of God calleth
sinners to repentance.
2. Hear the Apostle distinguishing each season, and do thou also distinguish
it.…“Thinkest thou,” he saith, “O man, that judgest them that do such things, and doest the
same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?” And as if we were to reply, Why do I
commit such sins daily, and no evil occurreth unto me? he goeth on to show to him the
season of mercy: “Despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-
suffering?” And he did indeed despise them; but the Apostle hath made him anxious. “Not
knowing,” he saith, “that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”4560 Behold the
season of mercy. But that he might not think this would last for ever, how did he in the next
verse raise his fears? Now hear the season of judgment; thou hast heard the season of mercy,
on which account, “mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord:” “But thou,” saith
the Apostle, “after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath
against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render
4559 Lat. C. A discourse to the people.
4560 Rom. ii. 4.
Psalm CI
Psalm CI
to every man according to his deeds.”4561 Lo, “mercy and judgment.” But he hath threatened
concerning judgment: is therefore the judgment of God to be feared only, and not to be
loved? To be feared by the wicked on account of punishment, to be loved by the good on
account of the crown. Because then the Apostle hath alarmed the wicked in the testimony
which I have quoted, hear where he giveth hope concerning judgment to the good. He puts
forth himself, and shows in himself too the season of mercy. For unless he found a period
of mercy, in what condition would judgment find him? A blasphemer, a persecutor, an injurer
of others. For he thus speaketh, and praiseth the season of mercy, in which season we are
now living: “I who was before,” he saith, “a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
but I obtained mercy.” But perhaps he only hath obtained mercy? Hear how he cheereth us:
“That in me,” he saith, “first, Christ Jesus might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern
to them which should hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting.”4562 What meaneth, “that
He might show forth all long-suffering”? That every sinner and wicked man might see that
Paul received pardon, and might not despair of himself? Lo, he hath instanced himself, and
thereby cheered others also.…But did Paul alone deserve this? For I had asserted, that as he
raised our fears by the former testimony, so did he encourage us by the latter. When he said,
“The Lord, the righteous Judge, shall render to me at that day:” he addeth, “and not to me
only, but unto all them also that love His appearing”4563 and His kingdom. Since therefore,
brethren, we have a season of mercy, let us not on that account flatter, or indulge ourselves,
saying, God spareth ever.…
3. “I will sing to the harp, and will have understanding, in the spotless way. When Thou
shalt come unto me” (ver. 2). Except in the spotless way, thou canst neither sing to the harp,
nor understand. If thou dost wish to understand, sing in the spotless way, that is, work with
cheerfulness before thy God. What is the spotless way? Hear what followeth: “I walked in
innocence, in the midst of my house.” This spotless way beginneth from innocence, and it
endeth also in innocence. Why seek many words? Be innocent: and thou hast perfected
righteousness.…But who is innocent? He who while he hurteth not another, injureth not
himself. For he who hurteth himself, is not innocent. Some one saith: Lo, I have not robbed
any one, I have not oppressed any one: I will live happily on my own substance, the fruits
of my virtuous toil; I wish to have fine banquets, I wish to spend as much as pleaseth me,
to drink with those whom I like as much as I please; whom have I robbed, whom have I
oppressed, who hath complained of me? He seemeth innocent. But if he corrupt himself, if
he overthrow the temple of God within himself, why hope that he will act with mercy toward
others, and spare the wretched? Can that man be merciful to others, who unto himself is
4561 Rom. ii. 5, 6.
4562 1 Tim. i. 13, 16.
4563 2 Tim. iv. 8.
Psalm CI
cruel? The whole of righteousness, therefore, is reduced to the one word, innocence. But
the lover of iniquity, hateth his own soul. When he loved iniquity, he fancied he was injuring
others. But consider whether he was injuring others: “He who loveth iniquity,” he saith,
“hateth his own soul.” 4564 He therefore who wishes to injure another, first injureth himself;
nor doth he walk, since there is no room. For all wickedness suffereth from narrowness:
innocence alone is broad enough to walk in. “I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the
midst of my house.” By the middle of his house, he either signifieth the Church herself; for
Christ walketh in her: or his own heart; for our inner house is our heart: as he hath explained
in the above words, “in the innocence of my heart.” What is the innocence of the heart? The
middle of his house? Whoever hath a bad house in this, is driven out of doors. For whoever
is oppressed within his heart by a bad conscience, just as any man in consequence of the
overflow of a waterspout or of smoke goeth out of his house, suffereth not himself to dwell
therein; so he who hath not a quiet heart, cannot happily dwell in his heart. Such men go
out of themselves in the bent of their mind, and delight themselves with things without,
that affect the body; they seek repose in trifles, in spectacles, in luxuries, in all evils.
Wherefore do they wish themselves well without? Because it is not well with them within,
so that they may rejoice in a good conscience.…
4. “I set no wicked thing before my eyes” (ver. 3).…I did love no wicked thing. And he
explaineth this same wicked thing: “I hated them that do unfaithfulness.” Attend, my
brethren. If ye walk with Christ in the midst of His house, that is, if either in your heart ye
have a good repose, or in the Church herself proceed on a good journey in the way of godli-
ness; ye ought not to hate those unfaithful only who are without, but whomsoever also ye
may have found within. Who are the unfaithful? They who hate the law of God; who hear,
and do it not, are called unfaithful. Hate the doers of unfaithfulness, repel them from thee.
But thou shouldest hate the unfaithful, not men: one man who is unfaithful, hath, ye see,
two names, man, and unfaithful: God made him man, he made himself unfaithful; love in
him what God made, persecute in him what he made himself. For when thou shalt have
persecuted his unfaithfulness, thou killest the work of man, and freest the work of God. “I
hated the doers of unfaithfulness.”
5. “The wicked heart hath not cleaved unto me.”…The heart of a man, who wisheth not
anything contrary to any that God wisheth, is called straight.…If therefore the righteous
heart followeth God, the crooked heart resisteth God. Suppose something untoward
happeneth to him, he crieth out, “God, what have I done unto Thee? What sin have I com-
mitted?” He wisheth himself to appear just, God unjust. What is so crooked as this? It is not
enough that thou art crooked thyself: thou must think thy rule crooked also. Reform thyself,
and thou findest Him straight, in departing from whom thou hast made thyself crooked.
4564 Ps. xi. 5.
Psalm CI
He doth justly, thou unjustly; and for this reason thou art perverse, since thou callest man
just, and God unjust. What man dost thou call just? Thyself. For when thou sayest, “What
have I done unto Thee?” thou thinkest thyself just. But let God answer thee: “Thou speakest
truth: thou hast done nothing to Me: thou hast done all things unto thyself; for if thou hadst
done anything for Me, thou wouldest have done good. For whatever is done well, is done
unto Me; because it is done according to My commandment; but whatever of evil is done,
is done unto thee, not unto Me; for the wicked man doth nothing except for his own sake,
since it is not what I command.” When ye see such men, brethren, reprove them, convince
and correct them: and if ye cannot reprove or correct them, consent not to them.
6. “When the wicked man departed from me, I knew him not” (ver. 4). I approved him
not, I praised him not, he pleased me not. For we find the word “to know” occasionally used
in Scripture, in the sense of “to be pleased.” For what is hidden from God, brethren? Doth
He know the just, and doth He not know the unjust? What dost thou think of, that He doth
not know? I say not, what thinkest thou; but what wilt thou ever think, that He will not have
seen beforehand? God knoweth all things, then; and yet in the end, that is in judgment after
mercy, He saith of some persons: “I will profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from
Me, ye workers of iniquity.”4565 Was there any one He did not know? But what meaneth,
“I never knew you”? I acknowledge you not in My rule. For I know the rule of My righteous-
ness: ye agree not with it, ye have turned aside from it, ye are crooked. Therefore He said
here also: “When the wicked man departed from Me, I knew him not.”…Therefore, “when
the wicked man departed from me,” that is, when the wicked man was unlike me, and was
unwilling to imitate my paths, was unwilling in his wickedness to live as I had proposed
myself for his imitation; “I knew him not.” What meaneth, “I knew him not”? Not that I
was ignorant of him, but that I did not approve him.
7. “Whoso privily slandered his neighbour, him I persecuted” (ver. 5). Behold the
righteous persecutor, not of the man, but of the sin. “With the proud eye, and the insatiable
heart, I did not feed.” What meaneth, “I did not feed with”? I did not eat in common with
such. Attend, beloved; since ye are about to hear something wonderful. If he did not feed
with this man, he did not eat with him; for to feed is to eat; how is it then that we find our
Lord Himself eating with the proud? It was not only with those publicans and sinners, for
they were humble: for they acknowledged their weakness, and asked for the physician. We
find that He ate with the proud Pharisees themselves. A certain proud man had invited Him:
it was the same who was displeased because a sinning woman, one of ill repute in the city,
approached the feet of our Lord.…That Pharisee was proud: the Lord ate with him; what is
it therefore that he saith? “With such an one I did not eat.” How doth He enjoin unto us
what He hath not done Himself? He exhorteth us to imitate Himself: we see that He ate with
4565 Matt. vii. 23.
Psalm CI
the proud; how doth He forbid us to eat with the proud? We indeed, brethren, for the sake
of reproof, abstain from communion with our brethren, and do not eat with them, that they
may be reformed? We rather eat with strangers, with Pagans, than with those who hold with
us, if we have seen that they live wickedly, that they may be ashamed, and amend; as the
Apostle saith, “And if any man obey not our word by this Epistle, note that man, and have
no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admon-
ish him as a brother.”4566 For the sake of healing others we usually do this; but nevertheless
we often eat with many strangers and ungodly men.
8. The pious heart hath its banquets, the proud heart hath its banquets: for it was on
account of the food of the proud heart, that he said, “with an insatiable heart.” How is the
proud heart fed? If a man is proud, he is envious: otherwise it cannot be. Pride is the
mother of enviousness: it cannot but generate it, and ever coexist with it. Every proud man
is, therefore, envious: if envious, he feedeth on the misfortunes of others. Whence the Apostle
saith, “But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed of one an-
other.”4567 Ye see them, then, eating: eat not with these: fly such banquets: for they cannot
satisfy themselves with rejoicing in others’ evils, because their hearts are insatiable. Beware
thou art not caught in their feasts by the devil’s noose.…Just as birds feed at the trap, or
fishes at the hook, they were taken, when they fed. The ungodly therefore have their own
feasts, the godly also have theirs. Hear the feasts of the godly: “Blessed are they who hunger
and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.”4568 If therefore the godly eateth the
meat of righteousness, and the ungodly of pride; it is no wonder if he is insatiable in heart.
He eateth the meat of iniquity: do not eat the meat of iniquity, and the proud in eye, and
the insatiable in heart, eateth not with thee.
9. And whence wast thou fed? And what pleased thee, when he did not eat with thee?
“Mine eyes,” he saith, “were upon such as are faithful in the land, that they might sit with
me” (ver. 6). That is, that with Me they might be seated.4569 In what sense are they “to sit”?
“Ye shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”4570 The faithful of the
earth judge, for to them it is said, “Know ye not, that we shall judge angels?”4571 “Whoso
walketh in a spotless way, he ministered unto me.” To “Me,” he saith, not to himself. For
many minister the Gospel, but unto themselves; because they seek their own things, not the
things of Jesus Christ.4572…

10. “The proud man hath not dwelt in the midst of my house” (ver. 7). Understand this
of the heart. The proud did not dwell in my heart: no such dwelt in my heart: for he hurried
away from me. None but the meek and peaceful dwelt in my heart; the proud dwelt not
there, for the unrighteous one dwelleth not in the heart of the righteous. Let the righteous
be distant from thee, I know not how many miles and stations:4573 ye dwell together, if ye
have one heart. “The proud doer hath not dwelt in the midst of my house: he that speaketh
unjust things hath not directed in the sight of my eyes.” This is the spotless way, where we
understand when the Lord cometh unto us.
11. “In the morning I destroyed all the ungodly that were in the land. That I may root
out all wicked doers from the city of the Lord” (ver. 8). This is obscure. There are then
wicked doers in the city of the Lord, and they at present, seemingly, spared. Why so? Because
it is the season of mercy: but that of judgment will come; for the Psalm thus began, “Of
mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord.”…
12. He at present spareth, He will then judge. But when will He judge? When night shall
have passed away. For this reason He hath said: “In the morning.” When the day shall at
last have arrived, night having passed by. Why doth He spare them until the dawn? Because
it was night. What meaneth, it was night? Because it was the season for mercy: He was
merciful, while the hearts of men were hidden. Thou seest some one living ill; thou endurest
him: for thou knowest not of what sort he will prove to be; since it is night; whether he who
to-day liveth ill, to-morrow may live well; and whether he who to-day liveth well, to-morrow
may be wicked. For it is night, and God endureth all men, since He is of long-suffering: He
endureth them, that sinners may be converted unto Him. But they who shall not have re-
formed themselves in that season of mercy, shall be slain. And wherefore? That they may
be scattered abroad 4574 from the city of the Lord, from the fellowship of Jerusalem, from
the fellowship of the Saints, from the fellowship of the Church. But when shall they be slain?
“At dawn.” What meaneth, “at dawn”? When night shall have passed away. Wherefore now
doth he spare? Because it is the season of mercy. Why doth He not always spare? Because,
“Mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord.” Brethren, let no man flatter himself:
all the doers of iniquity shall be slain; Christ shall slay them at the dawn, and shall destroy
them from His city. But now while it is the time of mercy, let them hear Him. Everywhere
He crieth out by the Law, by the Prophets, by the Psalms, by the Epistles, by the Gospels:
see that He is not silent; that He spareth; that He granteth mercy; but beware, for the judg-
ment will come.

Psalm CII.4575
1. Behold, one poor man prayeth, and prayeth not in silence. We may therefore hear
him, and see who he is: whether it be not perchance He, of whom the Apostle saith, “Though
He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be
rich.”4576 If it is He, then, how is He poor? For in what sense He is rich, who seeth not?
What then is richer than He, by whom riches were made, even those which are not true
riches? For through Him we have even these riches, ability, memory, character, health of
body, the senses, and the conformation of our limbs: for when these are safe, even the poor
are rich. Through Him also are those greater riches, faith, piety, justice, charity, chastity,
good conduct: for no man hath these, except through Him who justifieth the ungodly.…Be-
hold, how rich! In one so rich, how are we to recognise these words? “I have eaten ashes as
it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.”4577 Have these so great riches come
to this? The former state is a very high one, this is a very lowly one.…Yet still examine
whether this poor man be He; since, “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”4578
Reflect also upon these words: “I am Thy servant, and the Son of Thine handmaid.”4579
Observe, this handmaid, chaste, a virgin, and a mother: for there He received our poverty,
when He was clothed in the form of a servant, emptying Himself; lest thou shouldest dread
His riches, and in thy beggarly state shouldest not dare approach Him. There, I say, He put
on the form of a servant, there He was clothed with our poverty; there He made Himself
poor, and us rich. We are now drawing near to understand these things of Him: nevertheless
we may not as yet rashly pronounce.…
2. Let him add poverty then to poverty: let Him transfigure unto Himself our humble
body: let Him be our Head, we His limbs, let there be two in one flesh.4580…For He hath
deigned to hold even us as His limbs. The penitent also are among His limbs. For they are
not shut out, nor separated from His Church: nor would He make the Church His spouse,
unless by words like these: “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”4581 Let us
then hear what the head and the body prayeth, the bridegroom and bride, Christ and the
Church,4582 both one Person; but the Word and the flesh are not both one thing; the Father
and the Word are both one thing; Christ and the Church are both one Person, one perfect

man in the form of His own fulness.…Let us hear therefore Christ, poor within us and with
us, and for our sakes. For the title itself indicates the poor one. Lastly, remember that I
conjectured who that poor one was: let us hear His prayer, and recognise His Person; and
mistake not, when thou shalt have heard anything that cannot apply to His Head; it was for
this reason that I have prefaced as I have, that whatever thou shalt hear of this description,
thou mayest understand as sounding from the weakness of the body, and recognise the voice
of the members in the head. The title is, “A Prayer of the afflicted, when he was tormented,
and poured out his prayer before the Lord.” It is the same poor one who elsewhere saith:
“From the ends of the earth will I call upon Thee, when my heart is in heaviness.”4583 He
is afflicted because He is also Christ; who in the Prophet’s words calleth Himself both
Bridegroom and Bride: “He hath bound on me the diadem as on a bridegroom, and as a
bride hath adorned me with an ornament.”4584 He called Himself Bridegroom, He called
Himself Bride; wherefore this, unless Bridegroom applieth to the Head, Bride to the body?
They are one voice then, because they are one flesh. Let us hear, and recognise ourselves in
these words; and if we see that we are without, let us labour to be there.
3. “Hear my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto Thee” (ver. 1). “Hear my
prayer, O Lord,” is the same as, “Let my crying come unto Thee:” the feeling of the suppliant
is shown by the repetition. “Turn not Thy face away from me.” When did God turn away
His Face from His Son? when did the Father turn away His Face from Christ? But for the
sake of the poverty of my members, “Turn not away Thy face from me: whatsoever day I
am troubled, incline Thine ear unto me” (ver. 2).…Thou art in trouble this day, I am in
trouble; another is in trouble to-morrow, I am in trouble; after this generation other des-
cendants, who succeed your descendants, are in trouble, I am in trouble; down to the end
of the world, whoever are in trouble in My body, I am in trouble.…Peter prayed, Paul prayed,
the rest of the Apostles prayed; the faithful prayed in those times, the faithful prayed in the
following times, the faithful prayed in the times of the Martyrs, the faithful pray in our times,
the faithful will pray in the times of our descendants. “Right soon:” for I now ask that which
Thou art willing to grant. I ask not earthly things, as an earthly man; but redeemed at last
from my former captivity, I long for the kingdom of heaven; “Hear me right soon:” for it is
only to such a longing that Thou hast said, “Even while Thou art speaking, I will say, Here
I am.”4585 Wherefore dost thou call? in what tribulation? in what want? O poor one, before
the gate of God all-rich, in what longing dost thou beg? from what destitution dost thou ask
relief? from what want dost thou knock, that it may be opened unto thee?

Psalm CII
4. “For my days are consumed away like smoke” (ver. 3). O days! if days: for where day
is heard of, light is understood. “My days,” my times; wherefore, “like smoke,” unless from
the puffing up of pride?…See smoke, like pride, ascending, swelling, vanishing: deservedly
therefore failing, and not stedfast. “And my bones are scorched up as it were in an oven.”
Both my bones, and my strength, not without tribulation, not without burning. The bones
of the body of Christ, the strength of His body, is it anywhere greater than in the Holy
Apostles? And yet see that the bones are scorched. “Who is offended, and I burn not?”4586
They are brave, faithful, able interpreters and preachers of the word, living as they speak,
speaking as they hear; they are clearly brave, yet all who suffer offences, are an oven to them.
For there is love there, and more so in the bones. The bones are within all the flesh, and
support all the flesh. But if any man suffer any offence, and endanger his soul; the bone is
scorched in proportion as it loveth.…
5. Look back to Adam, whence the human race sprung. For how but from him was
misery propagated? whence but from him is this hereditary poverty? Let him then, who in
his own body was at one time in despair, now that he is set in Christ’s body, say with hope,
“My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass” (ver. 4). Deservedly, since all flesh is
grass.4587 But how did this happen unto thee? “Since I have forgotten to eat my bread.” For
God had given His commandment for bread. For what is the bread of the soul? The serpent
suggesting, and the woman transgressing, he touched the forbidden fruit,4588 he forgot the
commandment: his heart was smitten as it deserved, and withered like grass, since he forgot
to eat his bread. Having forgotten to eat bread, he drinketh poison: his heart is smitten, and
withered like grass.…Now eat that bread which thou hadst forgotten. But this very Bread
hath come, in whose body thou mayest remember the voice of thy forgetfulness, and cry
out in thy poverty, so that thou mayest receive riches. Now eat: for thou art in His body,
who saith, “I am the living bread which came down from heaven.”4589 Thou hadst forgotten
to eat thy bread; but after His crucifixion, “all the ends of the earth shall be reminded, and
be converted unto the Lord.”4590 After forgetfulness, let remembrance come, let bread be
eaten from heaven, that we may live; not manna, as they did eat, and died;4591 that bread,
of which it is said, “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness.”4592

6. “For the voice of my groaning, the bones cleave unto my flesh” (ver. 5). For many
groan, and I also groan; even for this I groan, because they groan for a wrong cause. That
man hath lost a piece of money, he groaneth: he hath lost faith, he groaneth not: I weigh the
money and the faith, and I find more cause for groaning for him who groaneth not as he
ought, or doth not groan at all. He committeth fraud, and rejoiceth. With what gain, with
what loss? He hath gained money, he hath lost righteousness. For the latter reason, he who
knoweth how to groan, groaneth; he who is near the head, who righteously clingeth to
Christ’s body, groaneth for this reason. But the carnal do not groan for this reason, and they
cause themselves to be groaned for, because they do not groan for this reason; nor can we
despise them, whether they groan not at all, or groan for the wrong cause. For we wish to
correct them, we wish to amend them, we wish to reform them, and when we cannot, we
groan; and when we groan, we are not separated from them.…
7. “I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, and like an owl among ruined walls”
(ver. 6). Behold three birds and three places: the pelican, the owl, and the sparrow;4593 and
the three places are severally, the wilderness, the ruined walls, and the house-top. The pelican
in the wilderness, the owl in the ruined walls, and the sparrow in the house-top. In the first
place we must explain, what the pelican signifieth: since it is born in a region which maketh
it unknown to us. It is born in lonely spots, especially those of the river Nile in Egypt.
Whatever kind of bird it is, let us consider what the Psalm intended to say of it. “It dwelleth,”
it saith, “in the wilderness.” Why enquire of its form, its limbs, its voice, its habits? As far
as the Psalm telleth thee, it is a bird that dwelleth in solitude. The owl is a bird that loveth
night. Parietinæ, or ruins, as we call them, are walls standing without roof, without inhab-
itants, these are the habitation of the owl. And then as to the house-top and the sparrows,
ye are familiar with them. I find, therefore, some one of Christ’s body, a preacher of the
word, sympathizing with the weak, seeking the gains of Christ, mindful of his Lord to
come.4594 Let us see these three things from the office of His steward. Hath such a man
come among those who are not Christians? He is a pelican in the wilderness. Hath he come
among those who were Christians, and have relapsed? He is an owl in the ruined walls; for
he forsaketh not even the darkness of those who dwell in night, he wisheth to gain even
these. Hath he come among such as are Christians dwelling in a house, not as if they believed
not, or as if they had let go what they had believed, but walking lukewarmly in what they
believe? The sparrow crieth unto them, not in the wilderness, because they are Christians;
nor in the ruined walls, because they have not relapsed; but because they are within the roof;
4593 [In the next verse.—C.]
4594 Matt. xxv. 26.
Psalm CII
under the roof rather, because they are under the flesh. The sparrow above the flesh crieth
out, husheth not up the commandments of God, nor becometh carnal, so that he be subject
to the roof. “What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye on the housetops.”4595 There are three
birds and three places; and one man may represent the three birds, and three men may
represent severally the three birds; and the three sorts of places, are three classes of men:
yet the wilderness, the ruined walls, and the house-top, are but three classes of men.
8. …Let us not pass over what is said, or even read, of this bird, that is, the pelican; not
rashly asserting anything, but yet not passing over what has been left to be read and uttered
by those who have written it. Do ye so hear, that if it be true, it may agree; if false, it may
not hold. These birds are said to slay their young with blows of their beaks, and for three
days to mourn them when slain by themselves in the nest: after which they say the mother
wounds herself deeply, and pours forth her blood over her young, bathed in which they re-
cover life. This may be true, it may be false: yet if it be true, see how it agreeth with Him,
who gave us life by His blood.4596 It agreeth with Him in that the mother’s flesh recalleth
to life her young with her blood; it agreeth well. For He calleth Himself a hen brooding over
her young.4597…If, then, it be so truly, this bird doth closely resemble the flesh of Christ,
by whose blood we have been called to life. But how may it agree with Christ, that the bird
herself slays her own young? Doth not this agree with it? “I will slay, and I will make alive:
I will wound, and I will heal.”4598 Would the persecutor Saul4599 have died, unless he were
wounded from heaven; or would the preacher be raised up, unless by life given him from
His blood? But let those who have written on the subject see to this; we ought not to allow
our understanding of it to rest upon doubtful ground.4600 Let us rather recognise this bird
in the wilderness; as the Psalm expresseth it, “A pelican in the solitude.” I suppose that Christ
born of a Virgin is here meant. He was born in loneliness, because He alone was thus born.
After the nativity, we come to His Passion.…Born in the wilderness, because alone so born;
suffering in the darkness of the Jews as it were in night, in their sin, as it were in ruins: what
next? “I have watched:” and “am become even as it were a sparrow, that sitteth alone upon
the house-top” (ver. 7). Thou hadst then slept amid the ruins, and hadst said, “I laid me
down, and slept.”4601 What meaneth, “I slept”? Because I chose, I slept: I slept for love of
night: but, “I rose again,” followeth. Therefore “I watched,” is here said. But after He watched,

what did He? He ascended into heaven, He became as a sparrow by flying; that is, by ascend-
ing; “alone on the house-top;” that is, in heaven. He is therefore as the pelican by birth, as
the owl by dying, as the sparrow by ascending again: there in the wilderness, as one alone;
here in the ruined walls, as one slain by those who could not stand in the building; and here
again watching and flying for our sakes alone on the house-top, He there intercedeth in our
behalf.4602 For our Head is as the sparrow, His body as the turtle-dove. “For the sparrow
hath found her an house.” What house? In heaven, where He doth mediate for us. “And the
turtle-dove a nest,” the Church of God hath found a nest from the wood of His Cross, where
“she may lay her young,” her children.
9. “Mine enemies revile me all day, and they that praised me are sworn together against
me” (ver. 8). With their mouth they praised, in their heart they were laying snares for me.
Hear their praise: “Master, we know that Thou art true, and teachest the way of God in
truth, neither carest Thou for any man. Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?”4603
And whence this evil repute, except because I came to make sinners my members, that by
repentance they may be in my body? Thence is all the calumny, thence the persecution.
“Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? They that be whole need not a phys-
ician, but they that be sick.”4604 Would that ye were aware of your sickness, that ye might
seek a physician; ye would not slay Him, and through your infatuated pride perish in a false
health.
10. “I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping” (ver. 9).
Because He chose to have among His members these kinds of men, that they should be
healed and set free, thence is the evil repute. Now at this day what is the character of Pagan
calumny against us? what, brethren, do ye conceive they tell us? Ye corrupt discipline, and
pervert the morality of the human race. Why dost thou attack us; say why? what have we
done? By giving, he replieth, to men room for repentance, by promising impunity for all
sins: for this reason men do evil deeds, careless of consequences, because everything is
pardoned them, when they are converted.…And what is to become of thee, miserable man,
if there shall be no harbour of impunity? If there is only licence for sinning, and no pardon
for sins, where wilt thou be, whither wilt thou go? Surely even for thee did it happen, that
that afflicted one ate ashes as it were bread, and mingled His drink with weeping. Doth not
such a feast now please thee? But nevertheless, he replieth, men add to their sins under the
hope of pardon. Nay, but they would add to them if they despaired of pardon. Dost thou
not observe in what licentious cruelty gladiators live? whence this, except because, as destined
for the sword and sacrifice, they choose to sate their lust, before they pour forth their blood?

4603 Matt. xxii. 16, 17.
4604 Matt. ix. 11, 12.
Psalm CII
4605 Wouldest not thou also thus address thyself? I am already a sinner, already an unjust
man, one already doomed to damnation, hope of pardon there is none: why should I not
do whatever pleaseth me, although it be not lawful? why not fulfil, as far as I can, any longings
I may have, if, after these, nothing but torments only be in store? Wouldest thou not thus
speak unto thyself, and from this very despair become still worse? Rather than this, then,
He who promiseth forgiveness, doth correct thee, saying, “As I live, saith the Lord, I have
no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and
live.”4606…For in order that men might not live the worse from despair, He promised a
harbour of forgiveness; again, that they might not live the worse from hope of pardon, He
made the day of death uncertain: fixing both with the utmost providence, both as a refuge
for the returning, and a terror to the loitering. Eat ashes as bread, and mingle thy drink with
weeping; by means of this banquet thou shalt reach the table of God. Despair not; pardon
hath been promised thee. Thanks be to God, he saith, because it is promised; I hold fast the
promise of God. Now therefore live well. To-morrow, he replieth, I will live well. God hath
promised the pardon; no one promised thee to-morrow.…
11. “And that because of thine indignation and wrath: because thou hast taken me up,
thou hast cast me down” (ver. 10). This is thy wrath, O Lord, in Adam: that wrath in which
we were all born, which cleaveth unto us by our birth; the wrath froth the stock of iniquity,
the wrath from the mass of sin: according to what the Apostle saith, “We also were once the
children of wrath, even as others.” For He saith not, the wrath of God shall come upon him:
but, “abideth upon him:” because that wrath in which he was born is not taken away.…Man
set in honour, is made in the image of God: raised up to this honour, lifted up from the dust,
from the earth, he hath received a reasonable soul; by the vivacity of that very reason, he is
placed before all beasts, cattle, birds that fly, and fishes.4607 For which of these hath reason
to understand? Because none of them is created in the image of God.…Therefore, “Because
Thou hast taken me up, Thou hast cast me down:” punishment followeth me, because Thou
hast given me a free choice. For if Thou hadst not given me a free choice, and for this reason
didst not make me better than cattle, just condemnation would not follow me when I sinned.
Thus Thou hast taken me up in giving me freedom of choice, and by Thy judgment Thou
hast cast me down.
12. “My days have declined like a shadow” (ver. 11).…He had said above, “My days are
consumed away like smoke;” and he now saith, “My days have declined like a shadow.” In
this shadow, day must be recognised; in this shadow, light must be discerned; lest afterward
it be said in late and fruitless repentance, “What hath pride profited us? or what good hath
4605 [See p. 315, note 10, supra.—C.]
4606 Ezek. xiii. 11.
4607 Gen. i. 26.
Psalm CII
riches with our vaunting brought us? All those things are passed away like a shadow.”4608
Say at this season, all things will pass away like a shadow, and thou mayest not pass away
like a shadow. “My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like grass.” For he
had said above, “my heart is smitten down, and I am withered like grass.” But the grass be-
dewed with the Saviour’s blood will flourish afresh. “I have withered like grass;” I, that is,
man, after that disobedience; this I have suffered from Thy just judgment: but what art
Thou?
13. For not because I have fallen, hast Thou grown old: for Thou art strong to set me
free, who hast been strong to humble me. “But Thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: and Thy
remembrance throughout all generations” (ver. 12). “Thy remembrance,” because Thou
dost not forget: “throughout all generations,” forasmuch as we know the promise of life,
both present and future.4609
14. “Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that Thou have mercy
upon her” (ver. 13). What time? “But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth
His Son, made of a woman, made under the Law.” And where is Sion? “To redeem them
that were under the Law.”4610 First then were the Jews: for thence were the Apostles, thence
those more than five hundred brethren,4611 thence that later multitude, who had but one
heart and one soul toward God.4612 Therefore, “the time is come.” What time? “Behold,
now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of salvation.”4613 Who saith this? That
Servant of God, that Builder, who said, “Ye are God’s building.”4614
15. Here therefore what saith he? “For thy servants take pleasure in her stones” (ver.
14). In whose stones? In the stones of Sion? But there are those there that are not stones.
Not stones of what? What then followeth? “and pity the dust thereof.” I understand by the
stones of Sion all the Prophets: there was the voice of preaching sent before, thence the
ministry of the Gospel assumed, through their preaching Christ became known. Therefore
thy servants have taken pleasure in the stones of Sion. But those faithless apostates from
God, who offended their Creator by their evil deeds, have returned to the earth, whence
they were taken. They have become dust, they have become ungodly.4615 But wait, Lord;
bear with us, Lord; be long-suffering, O Lord: let not the wind rush in, and sweep away this

dust from the face of the earth. Let thy servants come, let them come, let them acknowledge
in the stones thy voice, let them pity the dust of Sion, let them be formed in thy image: let
the dust say, lest it perish, “Remember that we are but dust.”4616 This of Sion: was not that
which crucified the Lord, dust? What is worse, it was dust from the ruined walls; altogether
dust it was, but nevertheless it was not in vain said of this dust, “Father, forgive them.” From
this very dust there came a wall of so many thousands who believed, and who laid the price
of their possessions at the Apostles’ feet. From that dust then there arose a human nature
formed4617 and beautiful. Who among the heathen acted thus? How few are there whom
we admire for having done thus, compared with the many thousands of these converts? At
first suddenly three, afterwards five thousand; all living in unity, all laying the price of their
possessions, when they had sold them, at the Apostles’ feet, that it might be distributed to
each, as each had need, who had one soul and one heart toward God.4618 Who made this
even of that very dust, but He who created Adam himself out of dust? This then is concerning
Sion, but not in Sion only.
16. “The heathen shall fear Thy Name, O Lord; and all the kings of the earth Thy Majesty”
(ver. 15). Now that Thou hast pitied Sion, now that Thy servants have taken pleasure in her
stones, by acknowledging the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets; now that they have
pitied her dust; so that man is formed, or rather re-formed, in life out of dust; hence
preaching hath increased among the heathen: let the heathen fear Thy Name, let another
wall approach also from the heathen, let the Corner Stone4619 be recognised, let the two
who come from different regions, but who no longer differ in belief, meet in close union.
17. “For the Lord shall build up Sion” (ver. 16). This work is going on now. O ye living
stones, run to the work of building, not to ruin. Sion is in building, beware of the ruined
walls: the tower is building, the ark is in building; remember the deluge. This work is in
progress now; but when Sion is built, what will happen? “And He will appear in His glory.”
That He might build up Sion, that He might be a foundation in Sion, He was seen by Sion,
but not in His glory: “we have seen Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.”4620 But truly
when He shall have come with His angels to judge,4621 shall they not look then upon Him
whom they have pierced?4622 and they shall be put to confusion when too late, who refused
confusion in early and healthful repentance.

18. “He hath turned Him unto the prayer of the poor destitute, and despised not their
desire” (ver. 17). This is going on now in the building of Sion: the builders of Sion pray,
they groan: He is the one poor, because the poor are many; because the thousands among
so many nations are one in Him, because He is the unity of the peace of the Church, He is
one, He is many: one, through love: many, on account of His extension. Therefore we now
pray, we now run: now, if any man hath used to be otherwise, and lived differently, let him
eat ashes as it were bread, and mingle his drink with weeping. Now is the time, when Sion
is in building: now the stones are entering into the structure: when the building is finished,
and the house dedicated, why dost thou run, to ask when too late, to beg in vain, to knock
to no purpose, doomed to abide without with the five foolish virgins? 4623 Therefore now
run.
19. “Let these things be written for those that come after” (ver. 18). When these words
were written, they profited not so much those among whom they were written for they were
written to prophesy the New Testament, among men who lived according to the Old Testa-
ment. But God had both given that Old Testament, and had settled in that land of promise
His own people. But since “Thy remembrance is from generation to generation,” belongeth
not to the ungodly, but to the righteous; “in our generation” belongeth to the Old Testament;
while “in the other generation” belongeth to the New Testament; and since the New Testa-
ment announceth this that was prophesied, “Let these things be written for those that come
after: and the people which shall be created, shall praise the Lord.” Not the people which is
created, but “the people which shall be created.” What is clearer, my brethren? Here is
prophesied that creation of which the Apostle saith: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he
is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”4624 “For
he hath looked down from His lofty sanctuary.” He hath looked down from on high, that
He might come unto the humble: from on high He hath become humble, that He might
exalt the humble.…
20. “Out of the heaven did the Lord look down upon the earth” (ver. 19): “that He might
hear the mournings of such as are in fetters, and deliver the children of such as are put to
death” (ver. 20). We have found it said in another Psalm, “O let the sorrowful sighs of the
fettered come before Thee;”4625 and in a passage where the voice of the martyrs was meant.
Whence are the martyrs in fetters?…But God had bound them with these fetters, hard indeed
and painful for a season, but endurable on account of His promises, unto whom it is said,
“On account of the words of Thy lips, I have kept hard ways.” We must indeed groan in
these fetters in order to gain the mercy of God. These fetters must not be shunned, in order
4623 Matt. xxv. 12.
4624 2 Cor. v. 17.
4625 Ps. lxxix. 11.
Psalm CII
to gain a destructive freedom and the temporal and brief pleasure of this life, to be followed
by perpetual bitterness. Accordingly Scripture,4626 that we may not refuse the fetters of
wisdom, thus addresseth us: “…Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her
chains a robe of glory.” Let the fettered therefore cry out, as long as they are in the chains
of the discipline of God, in which the martyrs have been tried: the fetters shall be loosed,
and they shall fly away, and these very fetters shall afterwards be turned into an ornament.
This hath happened with the martyrs. For what have the persecutors effected by killing
them, except that their fetters were thereby loosed, and turned into crowns?…The remission
of sins, is the loosing. For what would it have profited Lazarus, that he came forth from the
tomb, unless it were said to him, “loose him, and let him go”?4627 Himself indeed with His
voice aroused him from the tomb, Himself restored his life by crying unto him, Himself
overcame the mass of earth that was heaped upon the tomb, and he came forth bound hand
and foot: not therefore with his own feet, but by the power of Him who drew him forth.
This taketh place in the heart of the penitent: when thou hearest a man is sorry for his sins,
he hath already come again to life; when thou hearest him by confessing 4628 lay bare his
conscience, he is already drawn forth from the tomb, but he is not as yet loosed. When is
he loosed, and by whom is he loosed? “Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth,” He saith,
“shall be loosed in Heaven.”4629 Forgiveness of sins may justly be granted by the Church:
but the dead man himself cannot be aroused except by the Lord crying within him; for God
doth this within him. We speak to your ears: how do we know what may be going on in
your hearts? But what is going on within, is not our doing, but His.4630
21. “That the name of the Lord may be declared in Sion” (ver. 21). For at first, when the
fettered were appointed unto death, the Church was oppressed: since these tribulations the
Name of the Lord has been declared in Sion, with great freedom, in the Church herself. For
she is Sion: not that one spot, at first proud, afterwards taken captive; but the Sion whose
shadow was that Sion, which signifieth a watch-tower; because when placed in the flesh, we
see into the things before us, extending ourselves not to the present which is now, but to
the future. Thus it is a watch-tower: for every watcher gazes far. Places where guards are
set, are termed watch-towers: these are set on rocks, on mountains, in trees, that a wider
prospect may be commanded from a higher eminence. Sion therefore is a watch-tower, the
Church is a watch-tower.…If therefore the Church be a watch-tower, the Name of the Lord

is already declared there. Not the Lord’s Name only is declared in that Sion, but “His praise,”
He saith, “in Jerusalem.”
22. And how is it declared? “In the nations gathering together in one, and the kingdoms,
that they may serve the Lord” (ver. 22). How is this accomplished, unless by the blood of
the slain? How accomplished, but by the groans of the fettered? Those therefore who were
in tribulation and humility have been heard; that in our times the Church might be in the
great glory which we see her in, so that the very kingdoms which then persecuted her, now
serve the Lord.
23. “She answered Him in the way of His strength” (ver. 23).…The preceding words
show, that either “His praise,” or “Jerusalem,” answered: for it was said, “And His praise in
Jerusalem; in the nations gathering together in one, and the kingdoms, that they may serve
the Lord. Respondit ei.” We cannot say, “the kingdoms answered,” for he would have said
responderunt. Respondit ei. We cannot say, “the nations answered,” for he would have said,
responderunt (in the plural). Since then it is Respondit ei, in the singular, we look for the
singular number above, and find that the words, “His praise,” and “Jerusalem,” are the only
words in which we find it. But since it is doubtful, whether it be “His praise,” or “Jerusalem,”
let us expound it each way. How did “His praise” answer Him? When they who are called
by Him thank Him. For He calleth, we answer; not by our voice, but by our faith; not by
our tongue, but by our life.…From His elect and holy men, Jerusalem also answereth Him.
For Jerusalem also was called: and the first Jerusalem refused to hear, and it was said unto
her, “Behold, thy house shall be left unto the desolate.”4631…But that Jerusalem, of whom
it was written, “Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear,”4632 “She hath answered Him.”
What meaneth, “She hath answered Him”? She despiseth Him not when He called. He sent
rain, She gave fruit.
24. “She answered Him:” but where? “in the path of His strength.”…The Church
therefore answered Him not in the way of weakness; because after His resurrection He called
the Church from the whole world, no longer weak upon the cross, but strong in heaven.
For it is not the praise of the Christian faith that they believe that Christ died, but that they
believe that He arose from the dead. Even the Pagan believeth that He died; and maketh
this a charge against thee, that thou hast believed in one dead. What then is thy praise? It is
that thou believest that Christ arose from the dead, and that thou dost hope that thou shalt
rise from the dead through Christ: this is the praise of faith. “For if thou shalt confess with
thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised Him
from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”4633…This is the faith of Christians. In this faith then,
4631 Matt. xxiii. 38.

Psalm CII
in which the Church is gathered, “She hath answered Him,” She gave Him worship according
to His commandments: “in the path of His strength,” not in the path of His weakness.
25. How she answered Him, ye have already heard above. “In the gathering of the nations
into one.” Herein she answered Him, in unity: he who is not in unity, answereth Him not.
For He is One, the Church is unity: none but unity answereth to Him who is One.…Since
some4634 were destined to say against her, She hath existed, and no longer doth exist; “Show
me,” He saith, “the shortness of my days,” what is it, that I know not what apostates from
me murmur against me? why is it that lost men contend that I have perished? For they surely
say this, that I have been, and no longer am: “Show me the shortness of my days.” I do not
ask from Thee about those everlasting days: they are without end, where I shall be; it is not
those I ask of: I ask of temporal days; show unto me my temporal days; “show me the
shortness,” not the eternity, “of my days.” Declare unto me, how long I shall be in this world:
on account of those who say, “She hath been,” and is no more: on account of those who say,
The Scriptures are fulfilled, all nations have believed, but the Church hath become apostate,
and hath perished from among all nations.…
26. Seest thou not that there are still nations among whom the Gospel hath not been
preached? Since then it is needful that what the Lord spoke shall be fulfilled, declaring unto
the Church the shortness of my days, that this Gospel be preached in all nations, and then
that the end may come, why is it that thou sayest that the Church hath already perished
from among all nations, when the Gospel is being preached for this purpose, that it may be
in all nations? Therefore the Church remaineth even unto the end of the world, in all nations;
and this is the shortness of Her days, because all that is limited is short; so that She may pass
into eternity from this brief existence. May heretics be lost,4635 may that which they are be
lost, and may they be found, that they may be what they are not. Shortness of days will be
unto the end of the world: shortness for this reason, because the whole of this season, I say
not from this day unto the end of the world, but from Adam down to the end of the world,
is a mere drop compared with eternity.
27. Let not therefore heretics flatter themselves against me, because I said, “the shortness
of my days,” as if they would not last down to the end of the world. For what hath he added?
“O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days” (ver. 24). Deal Thou not with me
according as heretics speak. Lead me on unto the end of the world, not only to the middle
of my days; and finish my short days, that Thou mayest afterwards grant unto me eternal
days. Wherefore then hast thou asked concerning the shortness of thy days? Wherefore?
Dost thou wish to hear? “Thy years are in the generation of generations.” This is why I asked
concerning those short days, because although my days should endure unto the end of the
4634 [i.e. the party of Donatus.—C.]
4635 Pereant.
Psalm CII
world, yet they are short in comparison of Thy days. For “Thy years are in the generation
of generations.” Wherefore doth he not say, Thy years are unto worlds of worlds; for thus
rather is eternity usually signified in the holy Scriptures; but he saith, “Thy years are in the
generation of generations”? But what are thy years? what, but those which do not come,
and then pass away? what, but they which come not, so as to cease again? For every day in
this season so cometh as to cease again; every hour, every month, every year; nothing of
these is stationary; before it hath come, it is to be; after it hath come, it will not be. Those
everlasting years of thine, therefore, those years that are not changed, “are in the generation
of generations.” There is a “generation of generations;” in that shall thy years be. There is
one such, and if we acknowledge it aright, we shall be in it, and the years of God shall be in
us. How shall they be in us? Just as God Himself shall be in us: whence it is said, “That God
may be all in all.”4636 For the years of God, and God Himself, are not different: but the years
of God are the eternity of God: eternity is the very substance of God, which hath nothing
changeable; there nothing is past, as if it were no longer: nothing is future, as if it existed
not as yet. There is nothing there but, Is: there is not there, Was, and Will be; because what
was, is now no longer: and what will be, is not as yet: but whatever is there, simply Is.…Behold
this great I Am! What is man’s being to this? To this great I Am, what is man, whatever he
be? Who can understand that To Be? who can share it? who can pant, aspire, presume that
he may be there? Despair not, human frailty! “I am,” He saith, “the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Thou hast heard what I am in Myself: now hear
what I am on thy account. This eternity then hath called us, and the Word burst forth from
eternity. It is now eternity, it is now the Word, and no longer time.
28. …From so many generations thou wilt gather together all the holy offspring of all
generations, and wilt form one generation thence: “In” this “generation of generations are
Thy years,” that is, that eternity will be in that generation, which is collected from all gener-
ations, and reduced into one; this shall share in Thy eternity. Other generations are born
for fulfilling their times, out of which this one is regenerated for ever; though changed it
shall be endued with life, it shall be fitted to bear Thee, receiving strength from Thee.
29. “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the Heavens
are the work of Thy hands” (ver. 25).…God laid the foundation of the earth, we know: the
heavens are the works of His hands. For do not imagine that God doth one thing with His
hand, another by His word. What He doth by His word, He doth by His hand: for He hath
not distinct bodily members, who said, “I Am That I Am.” And perhaps His Word is His
hand, assuredly His hand is His power. For inasmuch as it is said, “Let there be a firma-
ment,”4637 and there was a firmament; He is understood to have created it by His Word;
4636 1 Cor. xv. 28.
4637 Gen. i. 6.
Psalm CII
but when He said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness;”4638 He seemeth to
have created him by His hand. Hear therefore: “The heavens are the work of Thy hands.”
Lo, what He created by His word, He created also by His hands; because He created them
through His excellence, through His power. Observe rather what He created, and seek not
to know in what manner He created them. It is much to thee to understand how He created
them, since He created thyself so, that thou mayest first be a servant obeying, and afterwards
perhaps a friend understanding.4639
30. “They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure” (ver. 26). The Apostle Peter saith this
openly: “By the word of God the heavens were of old,” etc.4640 He hath said then that the
heavens have already perished by the flood: and we know that the heavens perished as far
as the extent of this atmosphere of ours. For the water increased, and filled the whole of that
space in which birds fly; thus perished the heavens that are near the earth; those heavens
which are meant when we speak of the birds of heaven. But there are heavens of heavens
higher than these in the firmament: but whether these also shall perish by fire, or those only
which perished also by the flood, is a much harder question among the learned, nor can it
easily, especially in a limited space of time, be explained. Let us therefore dismiss or put it
off; nevertheless, let us know that these things perish, and that God endureth.…
31. Perhaps by the heavens we here may understand, without being far-fetched, the
righteous themselves, the saints of God, abiding in whom God hath thundered in His
commandments, lightened in His miracles, watered the earth with the wisdom of truth, for
“The heavens have declared the glory of God.”4641 But shall they perish? Shall they in any
sense perish? In what sense? As a garment.4642 What is, as a garment? As to the body. For
the body is the garment of the soul; since our Lord called it a garment, when He said, “Is
not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?”4643 How then doth the garment
perish? “Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.”4644
They then shall perish: but as to the body: “But Thou shalt endure.”…Such heavens therefore
shall perish; not, however, for ever; they shall perish, that they may be changed. Doth not
the Psalm say this? Read the following: “They shall all wax old as doth a garment; and as a

vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall be changed.” Thou hearest of the garment,
of the vesture, and dost thou understand anything but the body? We may therefore hope
for the change of our bodies also, but from Him who was before us, and abideth after
us.…“But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail” (ver. 27). But what are we to those
years with these beggarly years? and what are they? Yet we ought not to despair. He had
already said in His great and exceeding Wisdom, “I Am That I Am;” and yet He saith to
console us, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob:”4645
and we are Abraham’s seed:4646 even we, although abject, although dust and ashes, trust in
Him. We are servants: but for our sakes our Lord took the garb of a servant:4647 for us who
are mortal the Immortal One deigned to die, for our sakes He showed His example of resur-
rection. Let us therefore hope that we may reach these lasting years, in which days are not
spent in a revolution of the Sun, but what is abideth even as it is, because it alone truly Is.
32. “The children of Thy servants shall dwell there: and their seed shall stand fast for
ages” (ver. 28): for the age of ages, the age of eternity, the age that abideth. But, “the children,”
he saith, “of Thy servants:” is it to be feared lest we be the servants of God, and our children,
and not ourselves, dwell there? Or if we are the children of the servants, inasmuch as we are
the Apostles’ children, what are we to say? Can those children rising after have so unhappy
a presumption, as to boast in their late succession, and so to venture to say, We shall be
there; the Apostles will not be there? May this be far from their piety as children, from their
faith as little ones, from their understanding when of age! The Apostles also will be there:
rams go before, lambs follow. Wherefore then, “the children of Thy servants;” and not in
brief, “Thy servants”? Both they are Thy servants, and their children are Thy servants; and
the children of these, their grandsons, what are they but Thy servants? Thou wouldest include
them all briefly, if Thou shouldest say, Thy servants shall dwell therein.…“The children of
Thy servants,” are the works of Thy servants; no one shall dwell there, but through his own
works. What therefore meaneth, Their children shall dwell? Let no man boast that he shall
dwell there, if he calleth himself God’s servant, and hath not works; for none but children
shall dwell there. What meaneth therefore, “The children of Thy servants shall dwell there”?
Thy servants shall dwell there by their own works, Thy servants shall dwell there through
their own children. Be not therefore barren, if thou dost wish to dwell there; send before
the children whom thou mayest follow, by sending them before thee, not by burying them.
Let thy children lead thee to the land of promise, the land of the living, not of the dying:
whilst thou art living here in this pilgrimage, let them go before thee, let them receive thee.…

Psalm CIII.4648
1. …“Bless the Lord, O my soul! and all that is within me, His holy Name” (ver. 1). I
suppose that he speaketh not of what is within the body; I do not suppose him to mean this,
that our lungs and liver, and so forth, are to burst forth into the voice of blessing of the Lord.
There are lungs in our breast indeed, like a kind of bellows, which send forth successive
breathings, which breathing forth of the air inhaled is pressed out into voice and sound,
when the words are articulated; nor can any utterance sound forth from our mouth, but
what the pressed lungs have given vent to; but this is not the meaning here; all this relateth
to the ears of men. God hath ears: the heart also hath a voice. A man speaketh to the things
within him, that they may bless God, and saith unto them, “all that is within me bless His
holy Name!” Dost thou ask the meaning of what is within thee? Thy soul itself. In saying
then, “all that is within me, bless His holy Name,” it only repeateth the above, “Bless the
Lord, O my soul:” for the word “Bless,” is understood. Cry out with thy voice, if there be a
man to hear; hush thy voice, when there is no man to hear thee; there is never wanting one
to hear all that is within thee. Blessing therefore hath already been uttered from our mouth,
when we were chanting these very words. We sung as much as sufficed for the time, and
were then silent: ought our hearts within us to be silent to the blessing of the Lord? Let the
sound of our voices bless Him at intervals, alternately, let the voice of our hearts be perpetual.
When thou comest to church to recite a hymn, thy voice soundeth forth the praises of God:
thou hast sung as far as thou couldest, thou hast left the church; let thy soul sound the praises
of God. Thou art engaged in thy daily work: let thy soul praise God. Thou art taking food;
see what the Apostle saith: “Whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God.”4649 I venture
to say; when thou sleepest, let thy soul praise the Lord. Let not thoughts of crime arouse
thee, let not the contrivances of thieving arouse thee, let not arranged plans of corrupt
dealing arouse thee. Thy innocence even when thou art sleeping is the voice of thy soul.
2. “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His rewards” (ver. 2). But the rewards
of the Lord cannot be before thine eyes unless thy sins are before thine eyes. Let not delight
in past sin be before thine eyes, but let the condemnation of sin be before thine eyes: con-
demnation from thee, forgiveness from God. For thus God rewardeth thee, so that thou
mayest say, “How shall I reward the Lord for all His rewards unto me?”4650 This it was that
the martyrs considering (whose memory we are this day celebrating), and all the saints who
have despised this life, and as ye have heard in the Epistle of St. John, laid down their lives
for the brethren, which is the perfection of love,4651 even as our Lord saith: “Greater love

Psalm CIII
Psalm CIII
hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends:”4652 this the holy martyrs,
then, considering, despised their lives here, that they might find them there, following our
Lord’s words when He said, “He that loveth his life, shall lose it; and he that loseth his life
for My sake, shall keep it unto life eternal.”4653…“Forget not,” he saith, “all His rewards:”
not awards, but “rewards.”4654 For something else was due, and what was not due hath been
paid. Whence also these words: “What,” he asketh, “shall I reward the Lord for all His rewards
unto me?” Thou hast rewarded good with evil; He rewardeth evil with good. How hast thou,
O man, rewarded thy God with evil for good? Thou who hast once been a blasphemer, and
a persecutor, and injurious,4655 hast rewarded blasphemies. For what good things? First,
because thou art: but a stone also is. Next, because thou livest: but a brute also liveth. What
reward wilt thou give the Lord, for His having created thee above all the cattle; and above
all the fowls of the air, in His image and likeness?4656 Seek not how to reward Him: give
back unto Him His own image: He requireth no more; He demandeth His own coin.4657…
3. Think thou, soul, of all the rewards of God, in thinking over all thy wicked deeds: for
as many as are thy sins, so many are His rewards of good. And what present, what offering,
what sacrifice, canst thou ever tender unto Him?…What wilt thou reward the Lord with?
For thou wast reflecting, and couldest not find: “I will receive the cup of salvation.” What?
hath not the Lord Himself given the cup of salvation? Reward Him from thine own, if thou
canst. I would say, No, do it not; reward Him not from thine own; God doth not will to be
rewarded from thine own. If thou rewardest Him from thine own, thou rewardest sin. For
all that thou hast thou hast from Him: sins only thou hast of thine own. He doth not wish
to be rewarded from thine, He doth will from His own. Just as, if thou shouldest bring to a
husbandman, from the land which he hath sown, an ear of wheat, thou hast rewarded him
from the husbandman’s own produce; if thorns, that hast offered him of thine own. Reward
truth, in truth praise the Lord: if thou shalt choose to reward Him from thine own, thou
wilt lie. He who speaketh a lie, speaketh of his own.4658 If he who speaketh a lie, speaketh
of his own: so he who speaketh truth, speaketh of the Lord’s. But what is to receive the cup
of salvation, but to imitate the Passion of our Lord?…I will receive the cup of Christ, I will
drink of our Lord’s Passion. Beware that thou fail not. But, “I will call upon the Name of
the Lord.” They then who failed, called not upon the Lord; they presumed in their own

strength. Do thou so return, as remembering that thou art returning what thou hast received.
So then let thy soul bless the Lord, as not to forget all His rewards.
4. Hear ye all His rewards. “Who forgiveth all thy sin: who healeth all thine infirmities”
(ver. 3). Behold His rewards. What, save punishment, was due unto the sinner? What was
due to the blasphemer, but the hell of burning fire? He gave not these rewards: that thou
mayest not shudder with dread: and without love fear Him.…But thou art a sinner. Turn
again, and receive these His rewards: He “forgiveth all thy sin.”…Yet even after remission
of sins the soul herself is shaken by certain passions; still is she amid the dangers of
temptation, still is she pleased with certain suggestions; with some she is not pleased, and
sometimes she consenteth unto some of those with which she is pleased: she is taken. This
is infirmity: but He “healeth all thine infirmities.” All thine infirmities shall be healed: fear
not. They are great, thou wilt say: but the Physician is greater. No infirmity cometh before
the Almighty Physician as incurable: only suffer thou thyself to be healed: repel not His
hands; He knoweth how to deal with thee. Be not only pleased when He cherisheth thee,
but also bear with Him when He useth the knife: bear the pain of the remedy, reflecting on
thy future health.…Thou dost not endure in uncertainty: He who promised thee health,
cannot be deceived. The physician is often deceived: and promiseth health in the human
body. Why is he deceived? Because he is not healing his own creature. God made thy body,
God made thy soul. He knoweth how to restore what He hath made, He knoweth how to
fashion again what He hath already fashioned: do thou only be patient beneath the Physician’s
hands: for He hateth one who rejects His hands. This doth not happen with the hands of a
human physician.…
5. “Who redeemeth thy life from corruption” (ver. 4). Behold, “the body which is cor-
rupted, weigheth down the soul.”4659 The soul then hath life in a corruptible body. What
sort of life? It suffereth burdens, it beareth weights. How great obstacles are there to thinking
of God Himself, as it is right that men should think of God, as if interrupting us from the
necessity of human corruption? how many influences recall us, how many interrupt, how
many withdraw the mind when fixed on high? what a crowd of illusions, what tribes of
suggestions? All this in the human heart, as it were, teemeth with the worms of human
corruption. We have set forth the greatness of the disease, let us also praise the Physician.
Shall not He then heal thee, who made thee such as to be in health, hadst thou chosen to
keep the law of health which thou hadst received?…First think of thine own health. Some-
times a man is stricken in his own house, on his bed, with a more than usually manifest
disorder; although this disorder too, which men dislike to contemplate, be plain; yet each
man may be attacked with that sickness for which human physicians are sought, and may
gasp with fever in his bed; perhaps he may wish to consider of his domestic affairs, to make
4659 Wisd. ix. 15.
Psalm CIII
some order or disposition relating to his estate or his house; at once he is recalled from such
cares by the anxiety of his friends, plainly expressed around him, and he is advised to dismiss
these subjects, and first to take thought for his health. This then is addressed unto thee, and
to all men: if thou art not sick, think of other things: if thy very infirmity prove thee sick,
first take heed of thy health. Christ is thy health: think therefore of Christ. Receive the cup
of His saving Health, “who healeth all thine infirmities;” if thou shalt choose, thou shalt gain
this Health.…For thy life hath been redeemed from corruption: rest secure now: the contract
of good faith hath been entered upon; no man deceives, no man circumvents, no man op-
presses, thy Redeemer. He hath here made a barter, He hath already paid the price, He hath
poured forth His blood. The only Son of God, I say, hath shed His blood for us: O soul, raise
thyself, thou art of so great price.…“He redeemeth thy life from corruption.”
6. “Who crowneth thee with mercy and loving-kindness.” Thou hadst perhaps begun
to be in a manner proud, when thou didst hear the words, “He crowneth thee.” I am then
great, I have then wrestled. By whose strength? By thine, but supplied by Him.…He crowneth
thee, because He is crowning His own gifts, not thy deservings. “I laboured more abundantly
than they all,” said the Apostle; but see what he addeth: “yet not I, but the grace of God
which was with me.” 4660…It is then by His mercy that thou art crowned; in nothing be
proud; ever praise the Lord; forget not all His rewards. It is a reward when thou, a sinner
and an ungodly man, hast been called, that thou mayest be justified. It is a reward, when
thou art raised up and guided, that thou mayest not fall. It is a reward, when strength is
given thee, that thou mayest persevere unto the end. It is a reward, that even that flesh of
thine by which thou wast oppressed riseth again and that not even a hair of thy head perish-
eth. It is a reward, that after thy resurrection thou art crowned. It is a reward, that thou
mayest praise God Himself for evermore without ceasing.…
7. After the battle, then, I shall be crowned; after the crown, what shall I do? “He who
satisfieth thy longing with good things” (ver. 5).…Seek thy own good, O soul. For one thing
is good to one creature, another to another, and all creatures have a certain good of their
own, to the completeness and perfection of their nature. There is a difference as to what is
essential to each imperfect thing, in order that it may be made perfect; seek for thy own
good. “There is none good but One, that is, God.”4661 The highest good is thy good. What
then is wanting unto him to whom the highest good is good? For there are inferior goods,
which are good to different creatures respectively. What, brethren, is good unto the cattle,
save to fill the belly, to prevent want, to sleep, to indulge themselves, to exist, to be in health,
to propagate? This is good to them: and within certain bounds it hath an allotted measure
of good, granted by God, the Creator of all things. Dost thou seek such a good as this? God
4660 1 Cor. xv. 10.
4661 Matt. xix. 17.
Psalm CIII
giveth also this: but do not pursue it alone. Canst thou, a coheir of Christ, rejoice in fellowship
with cattle? Raise thy hope to the good of all goods. He will be thy good, by whom thou in
thy kind hast been made good, and by whom all things in their kind were made good. For
God made all things very good.…
8. When shall my longing be satisfied with good things? when, dost thou ask? “Thy
youth shall be renewed as the eagle’s.” Dost thou then ask when thy soul is to be satisfied
with good things? When thy youth shall be restored. And he addeth, as an eagle’s. Something
here lieth hidden; what however is said of the eagle, we will not pass over silently, since it
is not foreign to our purpose to understand it. Let this only be impressed upon our hearts,
that it is not said without cause by the Holy Spirit. For it hath intimated unto us a sort of
resurrection. And indeed the youth of the eagle is restored, but not into immortality, for a
similitude hath been given, as far as it could be drawn from a thing mortal to signify a thing
immortal, not to demonstrate it. The eagle is said, after it becometh overpowered with
bodily age, to be incapable of taking food from the immoderate length of its beak, which is
always increasing. For after the upper part of its beak, which forms a crook above the lower
part, hath increased from old age to an immoderate length, the length of this increase will
not allow of its opening its mouth, so as to form any interval between the lower beak and
the crook above. For unless there be such an opening, it hath no power of biting like a forceps,
by which to shear off what it may put within its jaws. The upper part therefore increasing,
and being too far hooked over, it cannot open its mouth, and take any food. This old age
doth to it, it is weighed down with the infirmity of age, and becometh too weak from want
of power to eat; two causes of infirmity assaulting it, old age, and want. By a natural device,
therefore, in order in some measure to restore its youth, the eagle is said to dash and strike
against a rock the upper lip of its beak, by the too great increase of which the opening for
eating is closed: and by thus rubbing it against the rock, it breaketh off the weight of its old
beak, which impeded its taking food. It cometh to its food, and everything is restored: it will
be after its old age like a young eagle; the vigour of all its limbs returneth, the lustre of its
plumage, the guidance of its wings, it flieth aloft as before, a sort of resurrection taketh place
in it. For this is the object of the similitude, like that of the Moon, which after waning and
being apparently intercepted, again is renewed, and becometh full; and signifieth to us the
resurrection; but when it is full it doth not remain so; again it waneth, that the signification
may never cease. Thus also what hath here been said of the eagle: the eagle is not restored
unto immortality, but we are unto eternal life; but the similitude is derived from hence, that
the rock taketh away from us what hindereth us. Presume not therefore on thy strength: the
firmness of the rock rubbeth off thy old age: for that Rock was Christ. 4662 In Christ our
youth shall be restored like that of the eagle.…
4662 1 Cor. x. 4.
Psalm CIII
9. “The Lord executeth mercy and judgment for all them that are oppressed with wrong”
(ver. 6).…An adulterous woman is brought forward to be stoned according to the Law, but
she is brought before the Lawgiver Himself.…Our Lord, at the time she was brought before
Him, bending His Head, began writing on the earth. When He bent Himself down upon
the earth, He then wrote on the earth: before He bent upon the earth, He wrote not on the
earth, but on stone. The earth was now something fertile, ready to bring forth from the
Lord’s letters. On the stone He had written the Law, intimating the hardness of the Jews:
He wrote on the earth, signifying the productiveness of Christians. Then they who were
leading the adulteress came, like raging waves against a rock: but they were dashed to pieces
by His answer. For He said to them, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
stone at her.” 4663 And again bending His head, He began writing on the ground. And now
each man, when he asked his own conscience, came not forward. It was not a weak adulterous
woman, but their own adulterate conscience, that drove them back. They wished to punish,
to judge; they came to the Rock, their judges were overthrown by the Rock.4664…
10. Execute mercy to4665 the wicked, not as being wicked. Do not receive the wicked,
in so far forth as he is wicked: that is, do not receive him as if from inclination towards and
love for his iniquity. For it is forbidden to give unto a sinner, and to receive sinners. Yet
how is this, “Give unto every man that asketh of thee”? and this, “if thine enemy hunger,
feed him”?4666 This is seemingly contradictory: but it is opened to those who knock in the
name of Christ, and will be clear unto those who seek. “Help not a sinner:” and, “give not
to the ungodly;”4667 and yet, “give unto every man that asketh of thee.” But it is a sinner
who asketh of me. Give, not as unto a sinner. When dost thou give as unto a sinner? When
that which maketh him a sinner, pleaseth thee so that thou givest.4668…Let those who give
to a man who fights with wild beasts, tell me why they give? Why doth he give to this man?
He loveth that in him, in which consists his greatest sin; this he feedeth, this he clotheth in
him, wickedness itself, made public by all witnessing it. Why doth the man give, who giveth
to actors, or to charioteers, or to courtesans? Do not these very persons give to human beings?
But it is not the nature of God’s work that they attend to, but the iniquity of the human
work.…When therefore thou givest, thou givest to infamy, not to bravery. As then he who

Psalm CIII
giveth to the fighter of beasts, giveth not to the man, but to a most infamous profession; for
if he were only a man, and not a fighter of beasts, thou wouldest not give; thou honourest
him in vice, not nature: so on the other hand, if thou give to the righteous, if thou give to
the prophet, if thou give to the disciple of Christ anything of which he is in want, without
thinking that he is Christ’s disciple, that he is God’s minister, that he is God’s steward; but
art thinking in that case of some temporal advantage, for instance, that when perchance he
shall be needful to thy cause, he may be bought for thee, because thou hast given him
something; thou hast no more given to the righteous, if thou hast thus given, than he gave
to the man, when he gave to the beast-fighter. The matter, then, most beloved, is quite open
to us, and I conceive, that although it was obscure, it is now clear. It was to this that the Lord
bound thee, when He said, “He who hath received the righteous man.” That were enough.
But as the righteous may be received with another intention,…He saith, “He who receiveth
a righteous man in the name of a righteous man:”4669 that is, receiving him in consideration
of his righteousness:…that is, because he is Christ’s disciple, because he is a steward of the
Mystery:4670 “Verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.”4671 So understand,
he who receiveth a sinner in the name of a sinner shall lose his reward.
11. …On this account therefore be merciful without fear, extend love even unto thine
enemies: punish those who chance to belong to thy government, restrain them with affection,
with charity, in regard to their eternal salvation; lest while thou sparest the flesh, the soul
perish. Do this: and though thou have to endure many,4672 over whom thou canst not exercise
discipline, because thou hast no lawful authority over them; bear their injuries; be without
apprehension. He will show mercy unto thee if thou shalt have been merciful: thou shalt be
merciful, without the injuries thou sufferest losing their punishment; “To Me belongeth
vengeance, I will repay,”4673 saith the Lord.
12. “He made His ways known unto Moses” (ver. 7).…For the Law was given with this
view, that the sick might be convinced of his infirmity, and pray for the physician. This is
the hidden way of God. Thou hadst long ago heard, “Who healeth all thine infirmities.”
Their infirmities were as yet hidden in the sick; the five books were given to Moses: the pool
was surrounded by five porches; he brought forth the sick, that they might lie there, that
they might be made known, not that they might be healed. The five porches discovered, but
healed not, the sick; the pool healed when one descended, and this when it was disturbed:4674

on which thou canst not exercise discipline.”
4673 Deut. xxxii. 35.
4674 John v. 2–4.
Psalm CIII
the disturbance of the pool was in our Lord’s Passion.…Since therefore this is a mystery
there, he teacheth that the Law was given that sinners might be convinced of their sin, and
call upon the Physician in order to receive grace.…Therefore, as I had begun to say, because
this is a great mystery in the Law, that it was given with this view, that by the increase of
sin, the proud might be humbled, the humbled might confess, the confessing might be
healed; these are the hidden ways, which He made known to Moses, through whom He gave
the Law, by which sin should abound, that grace might more abound.…“He hath made
known His good pleasure unto the children of Israel.” To all the children of Israel? To the
true children of Israel; yea, to all the children of Israel. For the treacherous, the insidious,
the hypocrites, are not children of Israel. And who are the children of Israel? “Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.” 4675
13. “The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great mercy” (ver.
8). Why so long-suffering? Why so great in mercy? Men sin and live; sins are added on, life
continueth: men blaspheme daily, and “He maketh His sun to rise over the good and the
wicked.”4676 On all sides He calleth to amendment, on all sides He calleth to repentance,
He calleth by the blessings of creation, He calleth by giving time for life, He calleth through
the reader, He calleth through the preacher, He calleth through the innermost thought by
the rod of correction, He calleth by the mercy of consolation: “He is long-suffering, and of
great mercy.” But take heed lest by ill using the length of God’s mercy, thou treasure up for
thyself, as the Apostle saith, wrath in the day of wrath.…For some there are who prepare
to turn, and yet put it off, and in them crieth out the raven’s voice, “Cras! Cras!”4677 The
raven which was sent from the ark, never returned.4678 God seeketh not procrastination in
the raven’s voice, but confession in the wailing of the dove. The dove, when sent forth, re-
turned. How long, To-morrow! To-morrow!? Look to thy last morrow: since thou knowest
not what is thy last morrow, let it suffice that thou hast lived up to this day a sinner. Thou
hast heard, often thou art wont to hear, thou hast heard to-day also; daily thou hearest, and
daily thou amendest not.…
14. “He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth He His anger for ever” (ver. 9). Since
it is in consequence of His anger that we live in the scourges and corruption4679 of mortality:
we have this in punishment for the first sin.…Is it not through His anger, my brethren, that
“in the sweat of thy face and in toil thou shalt eat bread, and the earth shall bear thorns and
thistles unto thee”?4680 This was said to our forefathers. Or if our life is different from this;

4680 Gen. iii. 19, 18.
Psalm CIII
if thou canst, turn unto some pleasure, where thou mayest not feel thorns. Choose what
thou hast wished, whether thou art covetous or luxurious; to name these two alone; add a
third passion, that of ambition; how great thorns are there in the desire of honours? in the
luxury of lusts how great thorns? in the ardour of covetousness how great thorns? What
troubles are there in base loves? What terrible anxieties here in this life? I omit hell. Beware
lest thou even now become a hell unto thyself. The whole of this, my brethren, is the result
of His anger: and when thou hast turned thyself unto works of righteousness, thou canst
not but toil upon earth; and toil endeth not before life endeth. We must toil on the way, that
we may rejoice in our country. He therefore consoleth by His promises thy toil, thy labours,
thy troubles, saying to thee, “He will not alway be chiding.”
15. “He hath not dealt with us according to our sins” (ver. 10). Thanks unto God, because
He hath vouchsafed this. We have not received what we were deserving of: “He hath not
dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our wickednesses.” “For
as the height of heaven above the earth, so hath the Lord confirmed His mercy toward them
that fear Him” (ver. 11). Observe the heaven: everywhere on every side it covereth the earth,
nor is there any part of the earth not covered by the heaven. Men sin beneath heaven: they
do all evil deeds beneath the heaven; yet they are covered by the heaven. Thence is light for
the eyes, thence air, thence breath, thence rain upon the earth for the sake of its fruits, thence
all mercy from heaven. Take away the aid of heaven from the earth: it will fail at once. As
then the protection of heaven abideth upon the earth, so doth the Lord’s protection abide
upon them that fear Him. Thou fearest God, His protection is above thee. But perhaps thou
art scourged, and conceivest that God hath forsaken thee. God hath forsaken thee,4681 if
the protection of heaven hath forsaken the earth.
16. “Look, how wide the east is from the west; so far hath He set our sins from us” (ver.
12). They who know the Sacraments know this; nevertheless, I only say what all may hear.4682
When sin is remitted, thy sins fall, thy grace riseth; thy sins are as it were on the decline, thy
grace which freeth thee on the rise. “Truth springeth from the earth.”4683 What meaneth
this? Thy grace is born, thy sins fall, thou art in a certain manner made new. Thou shouldest
look to the rising, and turn away from the setting.4684 Turn away from thy sins, turn unto
the grace of God; when thy sins fall, thou riseth and profitest.…One region of the heaven
falleth, another riseth: but the region which is now rising will set after twelve hours. Not
4681 Oxf. mss. repeat this: “God hath forsaken thee.”

4684 They looked toward the west, while they renounced Satan before Baptism, and then turned away to the
east. See St. Cyril’s Catechetical Lectures, lect. xix. Tr. p. 259.
Psalm CIII
like this is the grace which riseth unto us: both our sins fall for ever, and grace abideth for
ever.
17. “Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children, even so hath the Lord had mercy on
them that fear Him” (ver. 13). Let Him be as angry as He shall will, He is our Father. But
He hath scourged us, and afflicted us, and bruised us: He is our Father. Son, if thou bewailest,
wail beneath thy Father; do not so with indignation, do not so with the puffing up of pride.
What thou sufferest, whence thou mournest, it is medicine, not punishment; it is thy
chastening, not thy condemnation. Do not refuse the scourge, if thou dost not wish to be
refused thy heritage: do not think of what punishment thou sufferest in the scourge, but
what place thou hast in the Testament.
18. “For He knoweth our forming”4685 (ver. 14): that is, our infirmity. He knoweth what
He hath created, how it hath fallen, how it may be repaired, how it may be adopted, how it
may be enriched. Behold, we are made of clay: “The first man is of the earth, earthy: the
second man is the Lord from heaven.”4686 He sent even His own Son, Him who was made
the second man, Him who was God before all things. For He was second in His coming,
first in His returning: He died after many, He arose before all. “He knoweth our forming.”
What forming? Ourselves. Why sayest thou that He knoweth? Because He hath pitied.
“Remember that we are but dust.” Addressing God Himself, he saith, “Remember,” as if
God could forget: He perceiveth, He knoweth in such a manner that He cannot forget. But
what meaneth, “Remember”? Let thy mercy continue towards us. Thou knowest our forming;
forget not our forming, lest we forget thy grace.
19. “Man, his days are but as grass” (ver. 15). Let man consider what he is; let not man
be proud. “His days are but as grass.” Why is the grass proud, that is now flourishing, and
in a very short space dried up? Why is the grass proud that flourisheth only for a brief season,
until the sun be hot? It is then good for us that His mercy be upon us, and from grass make
gold. “For he flourisheth as a flower of the field.” The whole splendour of the human race;
honour, powers, riches, pride, threats, is the flower of the grass. That house flourisheth, and
that family is great, that family flourisheth; and how many flourish, and how many years
do they live! Many years to thee, are but a short season unto God. God doth not count, as
thou dost. Compared with the length and long life of ages, all the flower of any house is as
the flower of the field. All the beauty of the year hardly lasteth for the year. Whatever there
flourisheth, whatever there is warmed with heat, whatever there is beautiful, lasteth not;
nay, it cannot exist for one whole year. In how brief a season do flowers pass away, and these
are the beauty of the herbs! This which is so very beautiful, this quickly falleth.4687 Inasmuch
4685 Figmentum nostrum.
4686 1 Cor. xv. 47.
4687 Isa. xl. 6–8.
Psalm CIII
then as He knoweth as a father our forming, that we are but grass, and can only flourish for
a time; He sent unto us His Word, and His Word, which abideth for evermore, He hath
made a brother unto the grass which abideth not. Wonder not that thou shalt be a sharer
of His Eternity; He became Himself first a sharer of thy grass. Will He who assumed from
thee what was lowly, deny unto thee what is exalted in respect of thee?
20. “The wind shall go over on it, it shall not be; and the place thereof shall know it no
more” (ver. 16). For he is not speaking of grass, but of that for whose sake even the Word
became grass. For thou art man, and on thy account the Word became man. “All flesh is
grass:” “and the Word was made flesh.”4688 How great then is the hope of the grass, since
the Word hath been made flesh? That which abideth for evermore, hath not disdained to
assume grass, that the grass might not despair of itself.
21. In thy reflections therefore on thyself, think of thy low estate, think of thy dust: be
not lifted up: if thou art anything better, thou wilt be so by His Grace, thou wilt be so by His
mercy. For hear what followeth: “but the mercy of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon
them that fear Him” (ver. 17). Ye who fear not Him, will be grass, and in grass, and in torment
with the grass: for the flesh shall arise unto the torment. Let those who fear Him rejoice,
because His mercy is upon them.
22. “And His righteousness upon children’s children” (ver. 18). He speaketh of reward,
“upon children’s children.” How many servants of God are there who have not children,
how much less children’s children? But He calleth our works our children; the reward of
works, our “children’s children.” “Even upon such as keep His covenant.” Let men beware
that all may not conceive what is here said to belong to themselves: let them choose, while
they have the choice. “And keep in memory His commandments to do them.” Thou wast
already disposed to flatter thyself, and perhaps to recite to me the Psalter, which I have not
by heart, or from memory to say over the whole Law. Clearly thou art better in point of
memory than I, better than any righteous man who doth not know the Law word for word:
but see that thou keep the commandments. But how shouldest thou keep them? Not by
memory, but by life. “Such as keep in memory His commandments:” not, to recite them;
but, “to do them.” And now perhaps each man’s soul is disturbed. Who remembereth all
the commandments of God? who remembereth all the writings of God? Lo, I wish not only
to hold them in my memory, but also to do them in my works: but who remembereth them
all? Fear not: He burdeneth thee not: “on two commandments hang all the Law and the
Prophets.”4689…
23. “The Lord hath prepared His throne in heaven” (ver. 19). Who but Christ hath
prepared His throne in heaven? He who descended and ascended, He who died, and rose
4688 John i. 14.
4689 Matt. xxii. 40.
Psalm CIII
from the dead, He who lifted up to heaven the manhood He had assumed, hath Himself
prepared His throne in heaven. The throne is the seat of the Judge: observe therefore ye who
hear, that “He hath prepared His throne in heaven.”…The kingdom is the Lord’s, and He
shall be the Governor among the people.4690 “And His kingdom shall rule over all.”
24. “Bless ye the Lord, ye Angels of His, ye that are mighty in strength: ye that fulfil His
word” (ver. 20). By the word of God, then, thou art not righteous, nor faithful, unless when
thou dost it. “Ye that are mighty in strength, ye that fulfil His commandment, and hearken
unto the voice of His words.”
25. “Bless ye the Lord, all ye His hosts: ye servants of His that do His pleasure” (ver. 21).
All ye angels, all ye that are mighty in strength: ye that do His word: all ye His hosts, ye
servants of His that do His pleasure, do ye, ye bless the Lord. For all they who live wickedly,
though their tongues be silent, by their lips do curse the Lord. What doth it profit if thy
tongue singeth a hymn, while thy life breatheth sacrilege? By living ill thou hast set many
tongues to blasphemy. Thy tongue is given to the hymn, the tongues of those who behold
thee, to blasphemy. If then thou dost wish to bless the Lord, do His word, do His will.…
26. “Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of His, in all places of His dominion” (ver. 22).
Therefore in every place. Let Him not be blessed where He ruleth not: “in all places of His
dominion.” Let no man perchance say: I cannot praise the Lord in the East, because He hath
departed unto the West; or, I cannot praise Him in the West, because He is in the East. “For
neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the desert hills. And why? God is the
Judge.”4691 He is everywhere, in such wise that everywhere He may be praised: He is in such
wise on every side, that we may be joyful in Him on every side: He is in such wise blessed
on every side, that on every side we may live well.…“In every place of His dominion: bless
thou the Lord, O my soul!” The last verse is the same as the first: blessing is at the head of
the Psalm, blessing at the end; from blessing we set out, to blessing let us return, in blessing
let us reign. 4692

Psalm CIII
Psalm CIV.4693
1. …“Bless the Lord, O my soul.” Let the soul of us all, made one in Christ, say this. “O
Lord my God, Thou art magnified exceedingly!” (ver. 1). Where art Thou magnified?
“Confession and beauty Thou hast put on.” Confess ye, that ye may be beautified, that He
may put you on. “Clothed with light as a garment” (ver. 2). Clothed with His Church, because
she is made “light” in Him, who before was darkness in herself, as the apostle saith: “Ye
were sometime darkness, but now light in the Lord.”4694 “Stretching out the heaven like a
skin:” either as easily as thou dost a skin, if it be “as easily,” so that thou mayest take it after
the letter; or let us understand the authority of the Scriptures, spread out over the whole
world, under the name of a skin; because mortality is signified in a skin,4695 but all the au-
thority of the Divine Scriptures was dispensed unto us through mortal men, whose fame is
still spreading abroad now they are dead.
2. “Who covereth with waters the upper parts thereof” (ver. 3). The upper parts of what?
Of Heaven. What is Heaven? Figuratively only we said, the Divine Scripture. What are the
upper parts of the Divine Scripture? The commandment of love, than which there is none
more exalted.4696 But wherefore is love compared to waters? Because “the love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us.”4697 Whence is the
Spirit Himself water? because “Jesus stood and cried, He that believeth on Me, out of his
bosom shall flow rivers of living water.”4698 Whence do we prove that it was said of the
Spirit? Let the Evangelist himself declare, who followeth it up, and saith, “But this spake He
of the Spirit, which they were to receive, who should believe on Him.” “Who walketh above
the wings of the winds;” that is, above the virtues of souls. What is the virtue of a soul? Love
itself. But how doth He walk above it? Because the love of God toward us is greater than
ours toward God.
3. “Who maketh spirits His angels, and flaming fire His ministers” (ver. 4): that is, those
who are already spirits, who are spiritual, not carnal, He maketh His Angels, by sending
them to preach His gospel. “And flaming fire His ministers.” For unless the minister that
preacheth be on fire, he enflameth not him to whom he preacheth.
4. “He hath founded the earth upon its firmness” (ver. 5). He hath founded the Church
upon the firmness of the Church. What is the firmness of the Church, but the foundation
of the Church. What is the foundation of the Church, but that of which the Apostle saith,

“Other foundation can no man lay but that is laid, which is Christ Jesus.”4699 And therefore,
grounded on such a foundation, what hath she deserved to hear? “It shall not be bowed
forever and ever.” “He founded the earth on its firmness.” That is, He hath founded the
Church upon Christ the foundation. The Church will totter if the foundation totter; but
when shall Christ totter, before whose coming unto us, and taking flesh on Him, “all things
were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made;”4700 who holdeth all things
by His Majesty,4701 and us by His goodness? Since Christ faileth not, “she shall not be bowed
for ever and ever.” Where are they4702 who say that the Church hath perished from the
world, when she cannot even be bowed.…
5. “The deep, like a garment, is its clothing” (ver. 6). Whose? Is it perchance God’s? But
he had already said of His clothing, “Clothed with light as with a garment.”4703 I hear of
God clothed in light, and that light, if we will, are we. What is, if we will? if we are no longer
darkness. Therefore if God is clothed with light, whose clothing, again, is the deep? For an
immense mass of waters is called the deep. All water, all the moist nature, and the substance
everywhere shed abroad through the seas, and rivers, and hidden caves, is all together called
by one name, the Deep. Therefore we understand the earth, of which he said, “He hath
founded the earth.” Of it I believe he said, “The deep, like a garment is its clothing.” For the
water is as it were the clothing of the earth, surrounding it and covering it.…
6. “Above the mountains the waters shall stand:” that is, the clothing of the earth, which
is the deep, so increased, that the waters stood even above the mountains. We read of this
taking place in the deluge.…The Prophet minding to foretell future things, not to relate the
past, therefore said it, because he would have it understood that the Church should be in a
deluge of persecutions. For there was a time when the floods of persecutors had covered
God’s earth, God’s Church, and had so covered it, that not even those great ones appeared,
who are the mountains. For when they fled everywhere, how did they but cease to appear?
And perchance of those waters is that saying, “Save me, O God, for the waters are come in
even unto my soul.”4704 Especially the waters which make the sea, stormy, unfruitful. For
whatsoever earth the sea-water may have covered, it will not rather make it fruitful than
bring it to barrenness. For there were also mountains beneath the waters, because above the
mountains waters stood.4705…Why were the Apostles hidden by flight? Because “above the

4705 Oxf. mss. “shall stand.”
Psalm CIV
mountains the waters stood.”4706 The power of the waters was great, but how long? Hear
what followeth.
7. “From Thy rebuke they shall fly” (ver. 7). And this was done, brethren; from God’s
rebuke the waters did fly; that is, they went back from pressing on the mountains. Now the
mountains themselves stand forth, Peter and Paul: how do they tower! They who before
were pressed down by persecutors, now are venerated by emperors. For the waters are fled
from the rebuke of God; because “the heart of kings is in the hand of God, He hath bent it
whither He would;”4707 He commanded peace to be given by them to the Christians; the
authority of the Apostles sprang up and towered high.…The waters fled from the rebuke
of God. “From the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid.” Now who is there that would
not be afraid, from the voice of God through the Apostles, the voice of God through the
Scriptures, through His clouds? The sea is quieted, the waters have been made afraid, the
mountains have been laid bare, the emperor hath given the order. But who would have
given the order, unless God had thundered? Because God willed, they commanded, and it
was done. Therefore let no one of men arrogate anything to himself.
8. “The mountains ascend, and the plains go down, into the place which Thou hast
founded for them” (ver. 8). He is still speaking of waters. Let us not here understand
mountains as of earth; nor plains, as of earth: but waves so great that they may be compared
to mountains. The sea did sometime toss, and its waves were as mountains, which could
cover those mountains the Apostles. But how long do the mountains ascend and the plains
go down? They raged, and they are appeased. When they raged they were mountains: now
they are appeased they are become plains: for He hath founded a place for them. There is a
certain channel,4708 as it were a deep place, into which all those lately raging hearts of
mortals have retired.…They were mountains formerly, now they are plains: yet, my brethren,
even a dead calm4709 is sea. For wherefore are they not now violent? wherefore do they not
rage? Wherefore do they not try, if they cannot overthrow our earth, at least to cover it?
Wherefore not?
9. Hear. “Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over, neither shall they turn
again to cover the earth” (ver. 9). What then, because now the bitterest waves have received
a measure, that we must be allowed to preach such things even with freedom; because they
have had their due limit assigned, because they cannot pass over the bound that is set, nor
shall they return to cover the earth; what is doing in the earth itself? What workings take
place therein, now that the sea hath left it bare? Although at its beach slight waves do make

their noise, although Pagans still murmur round; the sound of the shores I hear, a deluge I
dread not. What then; what is doing in the earth? “Who sendeth out springs in the little
valleys” (ver. 10). “Thou sendest out,” he saith, “springs in the little valleys.” Ye know what
little valleys are, lower places among the lands. For to hills and mountains, valleys and little
valleys are opposed in contrary shape. Hills and mountains are swellings of the land: but
valleys and little valleys, lownesses of the lands. Do not despise low places, thence flow
springs. “Thou sendest out springs in the little valleys.” Hear a mountain. The Apostle saith,
“I laboured more than they all.” A certain greatness is brought before us: yet immediately,
that the waters may flow, he hath made himself a valley: “Yet not I, but the grace of God
with me.”4710 It is no contradiction that they who are mountains be also valleys: for as they
are called mountains because of their spiritual greatness, so also valleys because of the hu-
mility of their spirit. “Not I,” he saith, “but the grace of God with me.”…
10. What is, “In the midst between the mountains the waters shall pass through”? We
have heard who are the “mountains,” the great Preachers of the word, the exalted Angels of
God, though still in mortal flesh; lofty not by their own power, but by His grace; but as far
as relates to themselves, they are valleys, in their humility they send forth springs. “In the
midst,” he saith, “between the mountains, the waters shall pass through.” Let us suppose
this said thus, “In the midst between the Apostles shall pass through the preachings of the
Word of Truth.” What is, in the midst between the Apostles? What is called in the midst,
is common. A common property, from which all alike live, is in the midst, and belongs not
to me, but neither belongs it to thee, nor yet to me.…For if they are not in the midst, they
are as it were private, they flow not for public use, and I have mine, and he has his own, it
is not in the midst for both me and him to have it; but such is not the preaching of
peace.…Therefore, brethren, let what we have said to your Love serve to this purpose, because
of the springs: that they may flow from you, be ye valleys, and communicate with all that
which ye have from God. Let the waters flow in the midst, envy ye no one, drink, be filled,
flow forth when ye are filled. Everywhere let the common water of God have the glory, not
the private falsehoods of men.…
11. For it follows, “All the beasts of the wood shall drink” (ver. 11). We do indeed see
this also in the visible creation, that the beasts of the wood drink of springs, and of streams
that run between the mountains: but now since it hath pleased God to hide His own wisdom
in the figures of such things, not to take it away from earnest seekers, but to close it to them
that care not, and open it to them that knock; it hath also pleased our Lord God Himself to
exhort you by us to this, that in all these things which are said as if of the bodily and visible
creation, we may seek something spiritually hidden, in which when found we may rejoice.
4710 1 Cor. xv. 10.
Psalm CIV
The beasts of the wood, we understand the Gentiles, and Holy Scripture witnesses this in
many places.…
12. These beasts, then, drink those waters, but passing; not staying, but passing; for all
that teaching which in all this time is dispensed passeth.…Unless perchance your love
thinketh that in that city to which it is said, “Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem, praise thy God,
O Sion; for He hath made strong the bars of thy gates;”4711 when the bars are now
strengthened and the city closed, whence, as we said some time since,4712 no friend goeth
out, no enemy entereth;4713 that there we shall have a book to read, or speech to be explained
as it is now explained to you. Therefore is it now treated, that there it may be held fast:
therefore is it now divided by syllables, that there it may be contemplated whole and entire.
The Word of God will not be wanting there: but yet not by letters, not by sounds, not by
books,4714 not by a reader, not by an expositor. How then? As, “In the beginning was the
Word,” etc.4715 For He did not so come to us as to depart from thence; because He was in
this world, and the world was made by Him. Such a Word are we to contemplate. For “the
God of gods shall appear in Zion.”4716 But this when? After our pilgrimage, when the journey
is done: if however after our journey is done we be not delivered to the Judge, that the Judge
may send us to prison. But if when our journey is ended, as we hope, and wish, and endeav-
our, we shall have reached our Country, there shall we contemplate What we shall ever
praise; nor shall That fail which is present to us, nor we, who enjoy: nor shall he be cloyed
that eateth, nor shall that fail which he eateth. Great and wonderful shall be that contempla-
tion.…
13. “The onagers shall take for their thirst.” By onagers he meaneth some great beasts.
For who knoweth not that wild asses are called onagers? He meaneth, therefore, some great
untrained ones. For the Gentiles had no yoke of the Law: many nations lived after their own
customs, ranging in proud boastfulness as in a wilderness. And so indeed did all the beasts,
but the wild asses are put to signify the greater sort. They too shall drink for their thirst, for

4714 [I suppose many Christians have said, “Shall I no more recall my Bible, and be refreshed by the recol-
lection of these songs of our pilgrimage?” I could not think of heaven as a place where the Holy Scriptures should
be forgotten. The author’s idea comforts me.—C.]

Psalm CIV
for them too the waters flow. Thence drinks the hare, thence the wild ass: the hare little, the
wild ass great; the hare timid, the wild ass fierce: either sort drinks thence, but each for his
thirst.…So faithfully and gently doth it flow, as at once to satisfy the wild ass, and not to
alarm the hare. The sound of Tully’s voice rings out, Cicero is read, it is some book, it is a
dialogue of his, whether his own, or Plato’s, or by whatever such writer: some hear that are
unlearned, weak ones of less mind; who dareth to aspire to such a thing? It is a sound of
water, and that perchance turbid, but certainly flowing so violently, that a timid animal dare
not draw near and drink. To whom soundeth a Psalm, and he saith, It is too much for me?
Behold now what the Psalm soundeth; certainly they are hidden mysteries, yet so it
soundeth, that even children are delighted to hear, and the unlearned come to drink, and
when filled burst forth in singing.…
14. Then the Psalm goes on in its text, “Upon them4717 the fowls of the heaven shall
inhabit” (ver. 12).…Upon the mountains, then, the fowls of the air shall have their habitation.
We see these birds dwell upon the mountains, but many of them dwell in plains, many in
valleys, many in groves, many in gardens, not all upon mountains. There are some fowls
that dwell not save on the mountains. Some spiritual souls doth this name denote. Fowls
are spiritual hearts, which enjoy the free air. In the clearness of heaven these birds delight,
yet their feeding is on the mountains, there will they dwell. Ye know the mountains, they
have been already treated of. Mountains are Prophets, mountains are Apostles, mountains
are all preachers of the truth.…
15. But think not that those “fowls of heaven” follow their own authority; see what the
Psalm saith: “From the midst of the rocks they shall give their voice.” Now, if I shall say to
you, Believe, for this said Cicero, this said Plato, this said Pythagoras: which of you will not
laugh at me? For I shall be a bird that shall send forth my voice not from the rock. What
ought each one of you to say to me? what ought he who is thus instructed to say? “If any
one shall have preached unto you a gospel other than that ye have received, let him be ana-
thema.”4718 What dost thou tell me of Plato, and of Cicero, and of Virgil? Thou hast before
thee the rocks of the mountains, from the midst of the rocks give me thy voice. Let them be
heard, who hear from the rock: let them be heard, because also in those many rocks the One
Rock is heard: for “the Rock was Christ.”4719 Let them therefore be willingly heard, giving
their voice from the midst of the rocks. Nothing is sweeter than such a voice of birds. They
sound, and the rocks resound: they sound; spiritual men discuss: the rocks resound, testi-
monies of Scripture give answer. Lo! thence the fowls give their voice from the midst of the
rocks, for they dwell on the mountains.

Psalm CIV
16. “Watering the mountains from the higher places” (ver. 13). Now if a Gentile uncir-
cumcised man comes to us, about to believe in Christ, we give him baptism, and do not call
him back to those works of the Law. And if a Jew asks us why we do that, we sound from
the rock, we say, This Peter did, this Paul did: from the midst of the rocks we give our voice.
But that rock, Peter himself, that great mountain, when he prayed and saw that vision, was
watered from above.…
17. “From the fruit of Thy works shall the earth be satisfied.” What is, “From the fruit
of Thy works”? Let no man glory in his own works: but “he that glorieth, let him glory in
the Lord.”4720 With Thy grace he is satisfied, when he is satisfied: let him not say that grace
was given for his own merits. If it is called grace, “it is gratuitously given;” if it is returned
for works, wages are paid.4721 Freely therefore receive, because ungodly thou art justified.
18. “Bringing forth grass for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men” (ver. 14).
This is true, I perceive; I recognise the creation: the earth doth bring forth grass for the cattle,
and green herb for the service of men. But I perceive the words, “Thou shalt not muzzle the
mouth of the ox which treadeth out the corn: Doth God take care for oxen? For our sakes
therefore the Scripture saith it.” 4722 How then doth the earth bring forth grass for the cattle?
Because “the Lord hath ordained that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.”
He sent preachers, saying unto them, “Eat such things as are set before you of them: for the
labourer is worthy of his hire.”4723…They give spiritual, they receive carnal things; they
give gold, they receive grass.…“If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter
if we shall reap your carnal things?”4724 This the Apostle said, a preacher so laborious, so
indefatigable, so well tried, that he giveth this very grass to the earth. “Nevertheless,” he
saith, “we have not used this power.” He showeth that it is due to him, yet he received it not;
nor hath he condemned those who have received what was due. For those were to be con-
demned who exact what is not due, not they who accept their recompense: yet he gave up
even his own recompense. Thou dost not cease to owe to another, because one hath given
up his dues, otherwise thou wilt not be the watered earth which bringeth forth grass for the
cattle.…Thou receivest spiritual things, give carnal things in return: to the soldier they are
due, to the soldier thou returnest them; thou art the paymaster4725 of Christ. “Who goeth
a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit
thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? I speak not thus,

that it should be so done unto me.”4726 There has been such a soldier as gave up his rations
of food even to the paymaster: yet let the paymaster pay the rations.…
19. “That it may bring forth bread out of the earth.” What bread? Christ. Out of what
earth? From Peter, from Paul, from the other stewards of the truth. Hear that it is from the
earth: “We have,” saith St. Paul, “this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the
power may be of God, and not of us.”4727 He is the bread who descended from heaven,4728
that He might be brought forth out of the earth, when He is preached through the flesh of
His servants. The earth bringeth forth grass, that it may bring forth bread from the earth.
What earth bringeth forth grass? Pious, holy nations. That bread may be brought forth out
of what earth? The word of God out of the Apostles, out of the stewards of God’s Sacraments,
who still walk upon the earth, who still carry an earthly body.
20. “And wine maketh glad the heart of man” (ver. 15). Let no man prepare himself for
intoxication; nay, let every man prepare him for intoxication. “How excellent is Thy cup
which maketh inebriate!”4729 We choose not to say, Let no man be drunk. Be inebriated;
yet beware, from what source. If the excellent cup of the Lord doth saturate you, your ebriety
shall be seen in your works, it shall be seen in the holy love of righteousness, it shall, lastly,
be seen in the estrangement of your mind, but from things earthly to heavenly. “To make
him a cheerful countenance with oil.”…What is the making the countenance cheerful with
oil? The grace of God; a sort of shining for manifestation; as the Apostle saith, “The Spirit
is given to every man for manifestation.”4730 A certain grace which men can clearly see in
men, to conciliate holy love, is termed oil, for its divine splendour; and since it appeared
most excellent in Christ, the whole world loveth Him; who though while here He was scorned,
is now worshipped by every nation: “For the kingdom is the Lord’s, and He shall be Governor
among the people.”4731 For such is His grace, that many, who do not believe on Him, praise
Him, and declare that they are unwilling to believe on Him, because no man can fulfil what
He doth command. They who with reproaches once raged against Him, are hindered by
His very praises. Yet by all is He loved, by all is He preached; because He is excellently
anointed, therefore He is Christ: for He is called Christ from the Chrism or anointing which
He had. Messiah in the Hebrew, Christ in the Greek, Unctus in the Latin: but He anointeth
over His whole Body. All therefore who come, receive grace, that their countenances may
be made glad with oil.

21. “And bread strengtheneth man’s heart.” What is this, brethren? As it were, he hath
forced us to understand what bread he was speaking of. For while that visible bread
strengtheneth the stomach, feedeth the body, there is another bread which strengtheneth
the heart, in that it is the bread of the heart.…There is therefore a wine that truly maketh
glad the heart, and knoweth not to do aught else than to gladden the heart. But that thou
mayest not imagine that this indeed should be taken of the spiritual wine, but not of that
spiritual bread; He hath shown this very point, that it is also spiritual: “and bread,” he saith,
“strengtheneth man’s heart.” So understand it therefore of the bread as thou dost understand
it of the wine; hunger inwardly, thirst inwardly: “Blessed are they,” saith our Lord, “who
hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled.”4732 That bread is righteousness,
that wine is righteousness: it is truth, Christ is truth.4733 “I am,” He said, “the living bread,
who came down from heaven;”4734 and, “I am the Vine, and ye are the branches.”4735
22. “The trees of the plain shall be satisfied” (ver. 16): but with this grace, brought forth
out of the earth. “The trees of the plain,” are the lower orders of the nations. “And the cedars
of Libanus which He hath planted.” The cedars of Libanus, the powerful in the world, shall
themselves be filled. The bread, and wine, and oil of Christ hath reached senators, nobles,
kings; the trees of the plain are filled. First the humble are filled; next also the cedars of
Libanus, yet those which He hath planted; pious cedars, religious faithful; for such hath He
planted. For the ungodly also are cedars of Libanus; for, “The Lord shall break the cedars
of Libanus.”4736 For Libanus is a mountain: there are those trees, even according to the letter
most long-lived and most excellent. But Libanus is interpreted, as we read in those who
have written of these things, a brightness: and this brightness seemeth to belong to this
world, which at present shineth and is refulgent with its pomps. There are the cedars of
Libanus, which the Lord hath planted; those which the Lord hath planted shall be filled.…
23. “There shall the sparrows build their nests: their leader is the house of the coot” (ver.
17). Where shall the sparrows build? In the cedars of Libanus.…Who are the sparrows?
Sparrows are birds indeed, and fowls of the air, but small fowls are wont to be called sparrows.
There are therefore some spiritual ones that build in the cedars of Libanus: that is, there are
certain servants of God who hear in the Gospel, “Sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor;
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow Me.”4737…Let him who hath

resigned many things, not be proud. We know that Peter was a fisherman: what then could
he give up, to follow our Lord? Or his brother Andrew, or John and James the sons of
Zebedee, themselves also fishermen;4738 and yet what did they say? “Behold, we have forsaken
all, and followed Thee.”4739 Our Lord said not to him, Thou hast forgotten thy poverty;
what hast thou resigned, that thou shouldest receive the whole world? He, my brethren,
who resigned not only what he had, but also what he longed to have, resigned much.…
24. But although the sparrows will build in the cedars of Libanus, “the house of the coot
is their leader.” What is the house of the coot? The coot, as we all know, is a water bird,
dwelling either among the marshes, or on the sea. It hath rarely or never a home on the
shore; but in places in the midst of the waters, and thus usually in rocky islets, surrounded
by the waves. We therefore understand that the rock is the fit home of the coot, it never
dwelleth more securely than on the rock. On what sort of rock? One placed in the sea. And
if it is beaten by the waves, yet it breaketh the waves, is not broken by them: this is the excel-
lency of the rock in the sea. How great waves beat on our Lord Jesus Christ? The Jews dashed
against Him; they were broken, He remained whole. And let every one who doth imitate
Christ, so dwell in this world, that is, in this sea, where he cannot but feel storms and tem-
pests, that he may yield to no wind, to no wave, but remain whole, while he meets them all.
The home of the coot, therefore, is both strong and weak. The coot hath not a home on lofty
spots; nothing is more firm and nothing more humble than that home. Sparrows build indeed
in cedars, on account of actual need: but they hold that rock as their leader, which is beaten
by the waves, and yet not broken; for they imitate the sufferings of Christ.…
25. What then followeth? “The loftiest hills are for the stags” (ver. 18). The stags are
mighty, spiritual, passing in their course over all the thorny places of the thickets and woods.
“He maketh my feet like harts’ feet, and setteth me up on high.”4740 Let them hold to the
lofty hills, the lofty commandments of God; let them think on sublime subjects, let them
hold those which stand forth most in the Scriptures, let them be justified in the highest: for
those loftiest hills are for the stags. What of the humble beasts? what of the hare? what of
the hedgehog? The hare is a small and weak animal: the hedgehog is also prickly: the one is
a timid animal, the other is covered with prickles. What do the prickles signify, except sinners?
He who sinneth daily, although not great sins, is covered over with the smallest prickles. In
his timidity he is a hare: in his being covered with the minutest sins, he is a hedgehog: and
he cannot hold those lofty and perfect commandments. For “the loftiest hills are for the
stags.” What then? do these perish? No. For so “is the rock the refuge for the hedgehogs and
the hares.”4741 For the Lord is a refuge for the poor. Place that rock upon the land, it is a

refuge for hedgehogs, and for hares: place it on the sea, it is the home of the coot. Everywhere
the rock is useful. Even in the hills it is useful: for the hills without the rock’s foundation
would fall into the deep.…
26. “He appointed the Moon for certain seasons” (ver. 19). We understand spiritually
the Church increasing from the smallest size, and growing old as it were from the mortality
of this life; yet so, that it draweth nearer unto the Sun. I speak not of this moon visible to
the eye, but of that which is signified by this name. While the Church was in the dark, while
she as yet appeared not, shone not forth as yet, men were led astray, and it was said, This is
the Church, here is Christ; so that “while the Moon was dark, they shot their arrows at the
righteous in heart.”4742 How blind is he who now, when the Moon is full, wandereth astray?
“He appointed the Moon for certain seasons.” For here the Church temporarily is passing
away: for this subjection to death will not remain for ever: there will some time be an end
of waxing and waning; it is appointed for certain seasons. “And the sun knoweth his going
down.” And what sun is this, but that Sun of righteousness, whom the ungodly will lament
on the day of judgment never having risen for them; they who will say on that day, “Therefore
we wandered from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness shone not on us, and the
sun did not arise upon us.”4743 That sun riseth for him who understandeth Christ.…
27. Nor think, brethren, that the sun ought to be worshipped by some men, because the
sun doth sometimes in the Scriptures signify Christ. For such is the madness of men;4744
as if we said that a creature should be worshipped, when it is said, the sun is an emblem of
Christ. Then worship the rock also, for it also is a type of Christ.4745 “He was brought as a
lamb to the slaughter:”4746 worship the lamb also, since it is a type of Christ. “The Lion of
the tribe of Judah hath prevailed;”4747 worship the lion also, since it signifieth Christ. Observe
how numerous are the types of Christ: all these are Christ in similitude, not in essence.…
28. What then, when the sun went down, when our Lord suffered? There was a sort of
darkness with the Apostles, hope failed, in those to whom He at first seemed great, and the
Redeemer of all men. How so? “Thou didst make darkness, and it became night; wherein
all the beasts of the forest shall move” (ver. 20).…Here the beasts of the forest are used in
different ways: for these things are always understood in varying senses; as our Lord Himself
is at one time termed a lion, at another a lamb. What is so different as a lion and a lamb?

But what sort of lamb? One that could overcome the wolf, overcome the lion. He is the Rock,
He the Shepherd, He the Gate. The Shepherd entereth by the gate: and He saith, “I am the
good Shepherd:” and, “I am the Door of the Sheep.”4748…Learn thus to understand, when
these things are spoken figuratively; lest perchance when ye have read that the Rock signifieth
Christ,4749 ye may understand it to mean Him in every passage. In one place it meaneth
one thing, another in another, just as we can only understand the meaning of a letter by
seeing its position.4750 “The lion’s whelps roaring after their prey, do seek their meat from
God” (ver. 21). Justly then our Lord, when nigh unto His going down, the very Sun of
Righteousness recognising His going down, said to His disciples, as if darkness being about
to come, the lion would roam about to seek whom he might devour, that that lion could
devour no man, unless with leave: “Simon,” said He, “this night Satan hath desired to have
you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.” 4751
When Peter thrice denied,4752 was he not already between the lion’s teeth?…
29. “The Sun hath arisen, and they get them away together, and lay them down in their
dens” (ver. 22). More and more as the Sun riseth, so that Christ is recognised by the round
world, and glorified therein, do the lion’s whelps get them away together; those devils recede
from the persecution of the Church, who instigated men to persecute the house of God, by
working in the sons of unbelief. 4753 Now that none of them dareth persecute the Church,
“the Sun hath arisen, and they get them away together.” And where are they? “And they lay
them down in their dens.” Their dens are the hearts of the unbelieving. How many carry
lions crouching in their hearts? They burst not forth thence, they make no assault upon the
pilgrim Jerusalem. Wherefore do they not so? Because the Sun is already risen, and is shining
over the whole world.

it must always belong to it alone, thou wilt blot it out in the word Diabolus. For the word Deus beginneth with
the same letter as the word Diabolus: and nothing is so far apart, as God from the devil. Consider how utterly
ignorant of things both human and divine he must be, who shall say of the letter D, it ought not to be used in
the beginning of the word devil; and when thou hast asked the reason, replieth, I read that letter in the name of
God. Such a man is laughed at: for he is not worthy of an argument. Do not then so childishly interpret these
divine things, as if any of you were to think, from my having said above that the beasts of the forest signifies the
Gentiles, while I now say that they signify devils and the angels of disobedience, that I am contradicting what I

Psalm CIV
30. What art thou doing, O man of God? thou, O Church of God? what art thou, O body
of Christ, whose Head is in Heaven? what art thou doing, O man, His unity? “Man,” he
saith, “shall go forth to his work” (ver. 23). Let therefore this man work good works in the
security of the peace of the Church, let him work unto the end. For sometime there will be
a sort of general darkening, and a sort of assault will be made, but in the evening, that is, in
the end of the world: but now the Church doth work in peace and tranquillity; for “man
shall go forth to his work, and to his labour, unto the evening.”
31. “O Lord, how great are made Thy works!” (ver. 24). Justly great, justly sublime!
where were those works made, that are so great? what was that station where God stood, or
that seat whereupon He sat, when He did those works? what was the place where He worked
thus? whence did those so beautiful works proceed at the first? To take it word for word,
every ordained creation, running by ordinance, beautiful by ordinance, rising by ordinance,
setting by ordinance, going through all seasons by ordinance, whence hath it proceeded?
whence hath the Church herself received her rise, her growth, her perfection? In what
manner is she destined to a consummation in immortality? with what heralding is she
preached? by what mysteries is she recommended? by what types is she concealed? by what
preaching is she revealed? where hath God done these things? I see great works. “How great
are made Thy works, O Lord!” I ask where He hath made them: I find not the place: but I
see what followeth: “In Wisdom hast Thou made them all.” All therefore Thou hast made
in Christ.…“The earth is full of Thy creation.” The earth is full of the creation of Christ.
And how so? We discern how: for what was not made by the Father through the Son?
Whatever walketh and doth crawl on earth, whatever doth swim in the waters, whatever
flieth in the air, whatever doth revolve in heaven, how much more then the earth, the whole
universe, is the work of God. But he seems to me to speak here of some new creation, of
which the Apostle saith, “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things have passed
away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God.”4754 All who believe in
Christ, who put off the old man, and put on the new,4755 are a new creature. “The earth is
full of Thy works.” On one spot of the earth He was crucified, in one small spot that seed
fell into the earth, and died; but brought forth great fruit.…
32. “The earth is full of Thy creation.” Of what creation of Thine is the earth full? Of all
trees and shrubs, of all animals and flocks, and of the whole of the human race; the earth is
full of the creation of God. We see, know, read, recognise, praise, and in these we preach of
Him; yet we are not able to praise respecting these things, as fully as our heart doth abound
with praise after the beautiful contemplation of them. But we ought rather to heed that
creation, of which the Apostle saith, “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
4754 2 Cor. v. 17, 18.
4755 Eph. iv. 22–24.
Psalm CIV
are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”4756 What “old things have passed
away”? In the Gentiles, all idolatry; in the Jews themselves, all that servitude unto the Law,
all those sacrifices that were harbingers of the present Sacrifice. The oldness of man was
then abundant; One came to renovate His own work, to melt His silver, to form His coin,
and we now see the earth full of Christians believing in God, turning themselves away from
their former uncleanness and idolatry, from a past hope to the hope of a new age: and behold
it is not yet realized, but is already possessed in hope, and through that very hope we now
sing, and say, “The earth is full of Thy creation.” We do not as yet sing this in our country,
nor yet in that rest which is promised, the bars of the gates of Jerusalem not being as yet
made fast;4757 but still in our pilgrimage gazing upon the whole of this world, upon men
who on every side are running unto the faith, fearing hell, despising death, loving eternal
life, scorning the present, and filled with joy at such a spectacle, we say, “The earth is full of
Thy creation.”
33. …“So is the great and wide sea also; wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts” (ver. 25). He speaketh of the sea as terrible. Snares creep in this
world, and surprise the careless suddenly; for who numbereth the temptations that creep?
They creep, but beware, lest they snatch us away. Let us keep watch on the Wood; even in
the water,4758 even on the waves, we are safe: let not Christ sleep, let not faith sleep; if He
hath slept, let Him be awakened; He will command the winds; He will calm the sea;4759 the
voyage will be ended, and we shall rejoice in our country. For I see in this terrible sea unbe-
lievers still; for they dwell in barren and bitter waters: but they are both small and great. We
know this: many little men of this world are still unbelievers, many great men of this world
are so: there are living creatures, both small and great, in this sea. They hate the Church:
the name of Christ is a burden to them: they rage not, because they are not permitted; the
cruelty which cannot burst forth in deeds, is shut up within the heart. For all, whether small
or great, “creeping things, both small and great,” who at present grieve at the temples being
shut, the altars overthrown, the images broken, the laws which make it a capital crime to
sacrifice to idols; all who mourn on this account, are still in the sea. What then of us? And
by what road then are we to journey unto our country? Through this very sea, but on the
Wood. Fear not the danger; that wood which holdeth together the world doth bear thee up.
34. “There shall go the ships” (ver. 26). Lo, ships float upon that which alarmed you,
and sink not. By ships we understand churches; they go among the storms, among the
tempests of temptations, among the waves of the world, among the beasts, both small and
4756 2 Cor. v. 17.
4757 Ps. cxlvii. 13.
4758 Some mss. add, “On the cross let us sail;” but this may be a gloss.
4759 Matt. viii. 24–26.
Psalm CIV
great. Christ on the wood of His cross is the Pilot. “There shall go the ships.” Let not the
ships fear, let them not much mind where they float, but by Whom they are steered. “There
shall go the ships.” What voyage do they find tedious, when they feel that Christ is their Pilot?
They will sail safely, let them sail diligently, they will reach their promised haven, they will
be led to the land of rest.
35. There is also in that sea somewhat which transcends all creatures, great and small.
What is this? Let us hear the Psalm: “There is that Leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to
make sport of him.” There are creeping things innumerable, both small and great beasts;
there shall the ships go, and shall not fear, not only the creeping things innumerable, and
beasts both small and great, but not even the serpent which is there; “whom Thou,” he
speaketh unto God, “hast made to make sport of him.” This is a great mystery; and yet I am
about to utter what ye already know. Ye know that a certain serpent is the enemy of the
Church: ye have not seen him with the eyes of the flesh, but ye see him with the eyes of
faith.…
36. This serpent then, our ancient enemy, glowing with rage, cunning in his wiles, is in
the mighty sea. “Here is that Leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to make sport of him.”
Do thou now make sport of the serpent: for for this end was this serpent made. He falling
by his own sin from the sublime realms of the heavens, and made devil instead of angel,
received a certain region of his own in this mighty and spacious sea. What thou thinkest his
kingdom, is his prison. For many say: wherefore hath the devil received so great power, that
he may rule in this world, and prevaileth so much, can do so much? How much prevaileth
he? How much can he do? Unless by permission, he can do nothing. Do thou so act, that
he may not be allowed to attack thee; or if he be allowed to tempt thee, he may depart van-
quished, and may not gain thee. For he hath been allowed to tempt some holy men, servants
of God: they overcame him, because they departed not from the way, they whose heel he
watched, fell not.…
37. He then, my brethren, who doth wish to watch the serpent’s head, and safely to pass
this sea; for it must be that this serpent dwelleth here, and, as I had commenced saying, the
devil when he fell from heaven received this region; let him watch his head, on the part of
the fear of the world, and of the lusts of the world. For it is hence that he suggesteth some
object of fear or of desire; he trieth thy love, or thy fear. If thou fearest hell, and lovest the
kingdom of God, thou wilt watch his head.…“There is no power but of God.”4760 What
then fearest thou? Let the dragon be in the waters, let the dragon be in the sea: thou art to
pass through it. He is made so as to be made sport of, he is ordained to inhabit this place,
this region is given him. Thou thinkest that this habitation is a great thing for him, because
4760 Rom. xiii. 1.
Psalm CIV
thou knowest not the dwellings of the angels whence he fell:4761 what seemeth to thee his
glory, is his damnation.
38. …What then fearest thou? Perhaps he is about to try thy flesh: it is the scourge of
thy Lord, not the power of thy tempter. His wish is to injure that salvation which is promised:
but he is not allowed: but that he may not be allowed, have Christ for thy Head: repel the
serpent’s head: consent not unto his suggestion, slip not from thy path. “There is that Le-
viathan, whom Thou hast made to make sport of him.”
39. Dost thou wish to see how incapable he is of hurting thee, unless permitted? “These,”
he saith, “wait all upon Thee, that Thou mayest give them meat in due season” (ver. 27).
And this serpent wisheth to devour, but he devoureth not whom he wisheth.…Thou hast
heard what the serpent’s meat is. Thou dost not wish that God give thee to be devoured by
the serpent; because not the serpent’s food: i.e. forsake not the Word of God. For where it
is said to the serpent, “Dust thou shalt eat,” it is said to the transgressor, “Dust thou art, and
unto dust thou shalt return.”4762 Thou dost not wish to be the serpent’s food? be not dust.
How, thou repliest, shall I not be dust? If thou hast not a taste for earthly things. Hear the
Apostle, that thou mayest not be dust. For the body which thou wearest is earth: but do thou
refuse to be earth. What meaneth this? “Set your affection on things above, not on things
on the earth.”4763 If thou dost not set thy affections on earthly things, thou art not earth: if
thou art not earth, thou art not devoured by the serpent, whose appointed food is earth.
The Lord giveth the serpent his food when He will, what He will: but He judgeth rightly, he
cannot be deceived, He giveth him not gold for earth. “When Thou hast given it them, they
gather it.”…
40. “When thou openest Thy hand, they shall all be filled with good” (ver. 28). What is
it, O Lord, that Thou openest Thy hand? Christ is Thy hand. “To whom is the arm of the
Lord revealed?”4764 To whom it is revealed, unto him it is opened: for revelation is opening.
“When Thou openest Thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.” When Thou revealest
Thy Christ, “they shall all be filled with good.” But they have not good from themselves;
this is oftentimes proved unto them. “When Thou hidest Thy face, they are troubled” (ver.
29). Many filled with good have attributed to themselves what they had, and have wished
to boast as in their own righteousnesses, and have said to themselves, I am righteous; I am
great: and have become self-complacent. Unto these the Apostle speaketh: “What hast thou,
that thou didst not receive?”4765 But God, wishing to prove unto man that whatever he hath

Psalm CIV
he hath from Him, so that with good he may gain humility also, sometimes troubleth him;
He turneth away His face from him, and he falleth into temptation; and He showeth him
that his righteousness, and his walking aright, was only under His government.…
41. But wherefore dost Thou do this? wherefore dost Thou hide Thy face, that they may
be troubled? “Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail.” Their breath was their
pride; they boast, they attribute things to themselves, they justify themselves. Hide, therefore,
Thy face, that they may be troubled: take away their breath, and let them fail; let them cry
unto Thee, “Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not Thy face
from me.”4766 “Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned to
their dust.” The man who repenteth of his sin discovereth himself, that he had not strength
of himself; and doth confess unto God, saying, that he is earth and ashes. O proud one, thou
art turned to thine own dust, thy breath hath been taken away; no longer dost thou boast
thyself, no longer extol thyself, no longer justify thyself; thou seest that thou art made of
dust, and when the Lord turneth away His face, thou hast fallen back into thine own dust.
Pray, therefore, confess thy dust and thy weakness.
42. And see what followeth: “Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit,4767 and they shall be
made” (ver. 30). Thou shalt take away their spirit, and send forth Thine own: Thou shalt
take away their spirit: they shall have no spirit of their own. Are they then forsaken? “Blessed
are the poor in spirit:”4768 but they are not forsaken. They refused to have a spirit of their
own: they shall have the Spirit of God. Such were our Lord’s words to the future martyrs:4769
“It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.” Attribute not
your courage to yourselves. If it is yours, He saith, and not Mine, it is obstinacy, not courage.
“For we are His workmanship,” saith the Apostle, “created unto good works.”4770 From His
Spirit we have received grace, that we may live unto righteousness: for it is He that justifieth
the ungodly.4771 “Thou shalt take away their spirit, and they shall fail; Thou shalt send forth
Thy Spirit, and they shall be made: and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth:” that is, with
new men, confessing themselves to have been justified, not righteous of their own power,
so that the grace of God is in them. What then? When He hath taken away our spirit, we
shall be turned again to our dust, beholding to our edification our weakness, that when we
receive His Spirit we may be refreshed. See what followeth: “Be the glory of the Lord for
ever” (ver. 31). Not thine, not mine, not his, or his; not for a season, but “for ever.” “The

Psalm CIV
Lord shall rejoice in His works.” Not in thine, as if they were thine: because if thy works are
evil, it is through thy iniquity; if good, it is through the grace of God. “The Lord shall rejoice
in His works.”
43. “Who looketh on the earth, and maketh it tremble; who toucheth the hills, and they
shall smoke” (ver. 32). O earth, thou wast exulting in thy good, to thyself thou didst ascribe
thy fulness and opulence; behold, the Lord looketh on thee, and causeth thee to tremble.
May He look on thee, and make thee tremble: for the trembling of humility is better than
the confidence of pride.…For it is God, he saith, which worketh in you. For this reason then
with trembling, because God worketh in you. Because He gave, because what thou hast
cometh not from thee, thou shalt work with fear and trembling, for if thou fearest not Him,
He will take away what He gave. Work, therefore, with trembling. Hear another Psalm:
“Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.”4772 If we must rejoice with
trembling, God beholdeth us, there cometh an earthquake; when God looketh upon us, let
our hearts tremble; then will God rest there. Hear Him in another passage: “Upon whom
shall My Spirit rest? Even on him that is lowly and quiet, and who trembleth at My
Word.”4773
“Who looketh on the earth, and maketh it tremble; who toucheth the hills, and they
shall smoke” (ver. 32). The hills were proud, and boastful of themselves, God had not touched
them: He toucheth them, and they shall smoke. What meaneth the smoking of the hills?
That they pray unto the Lord. Behold great hills, proud hills, vast hills, prayed not to God:
they wished themselves to be entreated, and entreated not Him who was above them. For
what powerful, arrogant, proud man is there upon the earth, who deigneth humbly to entreat
God? I speak of the ungodly, not of the “cedars of Libanus, which the Lord hath planted.”
Every ungodly man, unhappy soul, knoweth not how to entreat God, while he wisheth
himself to be entreated by men. He is a hill; it is needful that God touch him, that he may
smoke: when he hath begun to smoke, he will offer prayers unto God, as it were the sacrifice
of his heart. He smoketh unto God, he then beateth his breast: he beginneth to weep, for
smoke doth elicit tears.
44. “I will sing unto the Lord in my life” (ver. 33). What will sing? Everything that is
willing. Let us sing unto the Lord in our life. Our life at present is only hope; our life will be
eternity hereafter: the life of mortal life, is the hope of an everlasting life. “I will praise my
God while I have my being.” Since I am in Him for ever and ever, while I have my being, I
will praise my God. Let us not imagine that, when we have commenced praising God in
that state, we shall have any other work: our whole life will be for the praises of God. If we
4772 Ps. ii. 11.
4773 Isa. lxvi. 2.
Psalm CIV
become weary of Him whom we praise, we may also become weary of praising. If He is ever
loved, He is ever praised by us.
45. “Let my discourse be pleasing to Him: my joy shall be in the Lord” (ver. 34). What
is the discourse of man unto God, save the confession of sins? Confess unto God what thou
art, and thou hast discoursed with Him. Discourse unto Him, do good works, and discourse.
“Wash you, make you clean,” saith Isaiah.4774 What is it to discourse unto God? Unfold
thyself to him who knoweth thee, that He may unfold Himself to thee who knowest not
Him. Behold, it is thy discourse that pleaseth the Lord; the offering of thy humility, the
tribulation of thy heart, the holocaust of thy life, this pleaseth God. But what is pleasing to
thyself? “My joy shall be in the Lord.” This is that discoursing which I meant between God
and thyself: show thyself to Him who knoweth thee, and He showeth Himself unto thee
who knowest not him. Pleasing unto Him is thy confession: sweet unto thee is His grace.
He hath spoken Himself unto thee. How? By the Word. What Word? Christ.…
46. “Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth” (ver. 35). He seemeth angry! O holy
soul, which here doth sing and groan! Would that our soul were with that very soul! Would
that it were coupled with it, associated, conjoined with it! It shall behold also His loving-
kindness when he is angry. For who but he who is filled with charity, understandeth this?
Thou tremblest, because he curseth. And who doth curse? A saint. Without doubt he is
listened to. But it is said unto the saints, “Bless, and curse not.” 4775 What is then the sense
of the words, “Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth”? Let them utterly be consumed;
let their spirit be taken away, that He may send forth His own Spirit, and they may be re-
stored. “And the ungodly, so that they be no more.” In what that they be no more, save as
wicked men? Let them therefore be justified, that they may no longer be ungodly. The
Psalmist saw this, and was filled with joy, and repeateth the first verse of the Psalm: “Bless
thou the Lord, O my soul.” Let our soul bless the Lord, brethren, since He hath deigned to
give unto us both understanding and the power of language, and unto you attention and
earnestness in hearing. Let each, as he can recall to mind what he hath heard, by mutual
conversation stir up the food ye have received, ruminate on what ye have heard, let it not
descend in you into the bowels of forgetfulness. Let the treasure to be desired4776 rest upon
your lips. These matters have been sought out and discovered with great labour, with great
labour have they been announced and discoursed of; may our toil be fruitful unto you, and
may our soul bless the Lord.

Psalm CIV
Psalm CV.4777
1. This Psalm is the first of those to which is prefixed the word Allelujah; the meaning
of which word, or rather two words, is, Praise the Lord. For this reason he beginneth with
praises: “O confess unto the Lord, and call upon His Name” (ver. 1); for this confession is
to be understood as praise, just as these words of our Lord, “I confess to Thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth.” 4778 For after commencing with praise, calling upon God is wont
to follow, whereunto he that prayeth doth next add4779 his longings: whence the Lord’s
Prayer itself hath at the commencement a very brief praise, in these words, “Our Father
which art in Heaven.”4780 The things prayed for, then follow.…This also followeth, “Tell
the people what things He hath done;”4781 or rather, to translate literally from the Greek,
as other Latin copies too have it, “Preach the Gospel of His works among the Gentiles.”
Unto whom is this addressed, save unto the Evangelists in prophecy?
2. “O sing unto Him, and play on instruments unto Him” (ver. 2). Praise Him both by
word and deed; for we sing with the voice, while we play with an instrument, that is, with
our hands. “Let your talking be of all His wondrous works. Be ye praise in His holy Name”
(ver. 3). These two verses may without any absurdity seem paraphrases of the two words
above; so that, “Let your talking be of all His wondrous works,” may express the words, “O
sing unto Him;” and what followeth, “be ye praised in His holy Name,” may be referred to
the words, “and play on instruments unto Him;” the former relating to the “good word”
wherewith we sing unto Him, in which His wondrous works are told; the latter to the good
work, in which sweet music is played unto Him, so that no man may wish to be praised for
a good work on the score of his own power to do it. For this reason, after saying, “be ye
praised,” which assuredly they who work well deservedly may, he added, “in His holy Name,”
since “he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”4782…This is to be praised in His holy
Name. Whence we read also in another Psalm: “My soul shall be praised in the Lord: let the
meek hear thereof, and be glad;”4783 which here in a sense followeth, “Let the heart of them
rejoice that seek the Lord:” for thus the meek are glad, who do not rival with a bitter jealousy
those whom they imitate as already workers of good.
3. “Seek the Lord, and be strengthened”4784 (ver. 4). This is very literally construed from
the Greek, though it may seem not a Latin word: whence other copies have, “be ye con-

firmed;” others, “be ye corroborated.”…While these words, then, “Come unto Him, and be
enlightened,”4785 apply to seeing; those in the text relate to doing: “Seek the Lord, and be
strengthened.”…But what meaneth, “Seek His face evermore”? I know indeed that to cling
unto God is good for me;4786 but if He is always being sought, when is He found? Did he
mean by “evermore,” the whole of the life we live here, whence we become conscious that
we ought thus to seek, since even when found He is still to be sought? To wit, faith hath
already found Him, but hope still seeketh Him. But love hath both found Him through faith,
and seeketh to have Him by sight, where He will then be found so as to satisfy us, and no
longer to need our search. For unless faith discovered Him in this life, it would not be said,
“Seek the Lord.” Also, if when discovered by faith, He were not still to be diligently sought,
it would not be said, “For if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for
it.”4787…And truly this is the sense of the words, “Seek His face evermore;” meaning that
discovery should not terminate that seeking, by which love is testified, but with the increase
of love the seeking of the discovered One should increase.
4. “Remember,” he saith, “His marvellous works that He hath done, His wonders, and
the judgments of His mouth” (ver. 5). This passage seemeth like that, “Thou shalt say unto
the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you:” an expression which, in ever so small
part, scarce a mind4788 taketh in. Then mentioning His own Name, He mercifully mingled
in His grace towards men, saying, “I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob; this is My Name for ever.”4789 By which He would have it to be understood, that
they whose God He declared Himself lived with Him for ever, and He said this, which might
be understood even by children, that they who by the great powers of love knew how to seek
His face for evermore, might according to their capacity comprehend, I Am that I Am.
5. Unto whom is it said, “O ye seed of Abraham His servant, ye children of Jacob, His
chosen”? (ver. 6).…He next addeth, “He is the Lord our God: His judgments are in all the
world” (ver. 7). Is He the God of the Jews only?4790 God forbid! “He is the Lord our God:”
because the Church, where His judgments are preached, is in all the world.…
6. “He hath been alway mindful of His covenant” (ver. 8). Other copies read, “for ever-
more;” and this arises from the ambiguity of the Greek. But if we are to understand “alway”
of this world and not of eternity, why, when he explaineth what covenant He was mindful
of, doth he add, “The word that He made to a thousand generations”? Now this may be

understood with a certain limitation; but he afterwards saith, “Even the covenant that He
made with Abraham” (ver. 9): “and the oath that He sware unto Isaac; and appointed the
same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting4791 testament” (ver. 10). But if in
this passage the Old Testament is to be understood, on account of the land of Canaan; for
thus the language of the Psalm runneth, “saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan:
the lot of your inheritance” (ver. 11): how is it to be understood as everlasting, since that
earthly inheritance could not be everlasting? And for this reason it is called the Old Testa-
ment, because it is abolished by the New. But a thousand generations do not seem to signify
anything eternal, since they involve an end; and yet are also too numerous for this very
temporal state. For by howsoever few years a generation is limited, such as in Greek is called
γεν™α, whereof the shortest period some have fixed is at fifteen years, after which period
man hath the power of generation; what then are those “thousand generations,” not only
from the time of Abraham, when that promise was made him, unto the New Testament,
but from Adam himself down to the end of the world? For who would dare to say that this
world should last for 15000 years? Hence it seemeth to me that we ought not to understand
here the Old Testament, which it said through the prophet was to be cancelled by the New:
“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant.”4792…After saying,
“He hath been mindful of His covenant unto an age;” which we ought to understand as
lasting for evermore, the covenant, namely, of justification and an eternal inheritance, which
God hath promised to faith; he addeth, “and the Word that He commanded4793 unto a
thousand generations.” What meaneth “commanded”?…The command then was faith, that
the righteous should live by faith;4794 and an eternal inheritance is set before this faith. “A
thousand generations,” then, are, on account of the perfect number, to be understood for
all; that is, as long as generation succeedeth generation, so long is it commanded to us to
live by faith. This the people of God doth observe, the sons of promise who succeed by birth,
and depart by death, until every generation be finished; and this is signified by the number
thousand; because the solid square of the number ten, ten times ten, and this taken ten times
amounts to a thousand. “Even the covenant,” he saith, “which He made with Abraham: and
the oath that He sware unto Isaac; and appointed the same unto Jacob,” that is, Jacob himself,
4791 [He adds: “Where there is no room for doubt: for the Greek has αἰώνιον, which our interpreters have
never rendered by any other word than eternal; though scarce any authors in any passage have used αἰώνιον in
the sense of everlasting. Unless perhaps, because they render αἴων as meaning time, in a more familiar way,
they may choose to interpret αἰώνιον, not eternal, but ‘for an age;’ which I do not remember any one having
ventured to do.” Conf. Matt. xxv. 46.—C.]

“for a law.” These are the very three patriarchs, whose God He calleth Himself in a special
sense, whom the Lord also doth name in the New Testament, where He saith, “Many shall
come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
in the kingdom of heaven.”4795 This is everlasting inheritance.…
7. He next followeth out the history well known in the truth of the holy Scriptures.
“When they were in small numbers, very few, and they strangers in the land” (ver. 12); that
is, in the land of Canaan.…But some copies have the words “very few, and they strangers,”
in the accusative case,4796 the translator having turned the Greek phrase too literally into
Latin. If we were to render the whole clause in this way, we must say, “that they were very
few, and they strangers;” but the phrase, “while they were,” is the meaning of the Greek;
and the verb, “to be,” takes not an accusative, but a nominative after it.4797
8. “What time as they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another
people” (ver. 13). This is a repetition of what he had said, “from one nation to another.”
“He suffered no man to do them harm: but reproved even kings for their sakes” (ver. 14).
“Touch not,” He said, “Mine anointed, and do My prophets no harm” (ver. 15). He declareth
the words of God chiding or reproving kings, that they might not harm the holy fathers,
while they were small in number, very few, and they strangers in the land of Canaan. Al-
though these words be not read in the books of that history, yet they are to be understood
as either secretly spoken, as God speaketh in the hearts of men by unseen and true visions,
or even as announced through an Angel. For both the king of Gerar and the king of the
Egyptians were warned from Heaven not to harm Abraham,4798 and another king not to
harm Isaac,4799 and others not to harm Jacob;4800 while they were very few, and strangers,
before he went over into Egypt to sojourn with his sons: which is understood to be herein
mentioned. But since it occurred to ask, before they passed over and multiplied in Egypt,
how so few in number, and those strangers in a foreign land, could maintain themselves:
he next addeth, “He suffered no man to do them wrong,” etc.
9. But it may well excite a question, in what sense they were styled (Christs, or) anointed,
before there was any unction, from which this title was given to the kings.4801…Whence
then were those patriarchs at that time called “anointed”? For that they were prophets, we
read concerning Abraham; and certainly, what is manifestly said of him, should be under-
4795 Matt. viii. 11.

stood of them also. Are they styled “christs,” because, even though secretly, yet they were
already Christians? For although the flesh of Christ came from them, nevertheless Christ
came before them; for He thus answered the Jews, “Before Abraham was, I am.” 4802 But
how could they not know Him, or not believe in Him; since they are called prophets for this
very reason, because, though somewhat darkly, they announced the Lord beforehand?
Whence He saith Himself openly, “Your father Abraham desired to see My day, and he saw
it, and was glad.”4803 For no man was ever reconciled unto God outside of that faith which
is in Christ Jesus, either before His Incarnation, or after: as it is most truly defined by the
Apostle: “For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ
Jesus.”4804
10. He then beginneth to relate how it happened that they went from one nation to an-
other, from one kingdom to another people. “He calleth,” he saith, “for a famine upon the
land: and brake all the staff of bread” (ver. 16). Thus it happened that they went from one
nation to another, from one kingdom to another people. But the expressions of the holy
Scriptures are not to be negligently passed by. “He called,” he saith, “for a famine upon the
land;” as if famine were some person, or some animated body, or some spirit that would
obey Him who called.…Under this impression the old Romans consecrated some such
deities, as the goddess Fever, and the god Paleness. Or meaneth it, as is more credible, He
said there should be famine; so that calling be the same thing as mentioning by name;
mentioning by name, as speaking; speaking, as commanding? Nor doth the Apostle say,
4805 “He calleth those things which be not, that they may be;” but, “as though they were.”
For with God that hath already happened which, according to His disposition, is fixed for
the future: for of Him it is elsewhere said, “He who made things to come.”4806 And here
when famine happened, then it is said to have been called, that is, that that which had been
determined in His secret government, might be realized. Lastly, he at once expounds, how
He called for the famine, saying, “He brake all the staff of bread.”
11. “But He had sent a man before them” (ver. 17). What man? “Even Joseph.” How
did He send him? “Joseph was sold to be a bond-servant.” When this happened, it was the
sin of his brethren, and, nevertheless, God sent Joseph into Egypt. We should therefore

Psalm CV
meditate on this important and necessary subject, how God useth well the evil works of
men, as they on the other hand use ill the good works of God.
12. Next he doth relate the story, mentioning what Joseph suffered in his low estate,
and how he was raised on high. “His feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his
soul, until his word came” (ver. 18). That Joseph was put in irons, we do not indeed read;
but we ought no ways to doubt that it was so. For some things might be passed over in that
history, which nevertheless would not escape the Holy Spirit, who speaketh in these Psalms.
We understand by the iron which entered into his soul, the tribulation of stern necessity;
for he did not say body, but “soul.” There is a somewhat similar expression in the Gospel,
where Simeon saith unto Mary, “A sword shall pierce through thy own soul also.”4807 That
is, the Passion of the Lord, which was a fall unto many, and in which the secrets of many
hearts were revealed, since their sentiments respecting the Lord were extorted from them,
without doubt made His own Mother exceeding sorrowful, heavily struck with human be-
reavement. Now Joseph was in this tribulation, “until his word came,” with which he truly
interpreted dreams: whence he was introduced to the king, that unto him also he might
foretell what would happen in respect to his dreams.4808 But since he said, “Until his words
were heard,” that we might not altogether so understand “his,” that any one might think so
great an event was to be ascribed unto man; he at once added, “The word of the Lord inflamed
him” (ver. 19); or, as other copies have it more closely from the Greek, “The word of the
Lord fired him,” that he also might be reputed amongst those to whom it is said, “Receive
ye praise in His holy Name.”4809
13. “The king sent and loosed him, the prince of the peoples, and let him go free” (ver.
20). The “king” is the same as “the prince of the peoples:” he “loosed” him from his bonds
“and let him go free” from his prison. “He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all
his substance” (ver. 21). “That he might inform his princes like unto himself, and teach his
old men wisdom” (ver. 22). The Greek hath, “and teach his elders wisdom.” Which might
altogether be rendered to the letter thus; “Might inform his princes like unto himself, and
make his elders wise.” The word translated old men being presbyters or elders, not gerontas,
old men: and to teach wisdom being from the Greek to sophize, which cannot be rendered
by a single word in Latin, and is from the word sophia, wisdom, different from prudence,
which is in Greek phronesis. Yet we do not read this in the high elevation of Joseph, as we
read not of fetters in his low estate. But how could it happen that so great a man, the wor-
shipper of the One True God, whilst in Egypt, should have been intent upon the nourishing
of bodies, and the government of carnal matters only, and have felt no anxiety for souls,
4807 Luke ii. 35.
4808 Gen. xli.
4809 Ps. cv. 3.
Psalm CV
and how he could render them better? But those things are written in that history, which,
according to the intention of the writer, in whom was the Holy Spirit, were judged sufficient
for signifying future events in that narration.
14. “Joseph also came into Egypt, and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham” (ver.
23). Israel is the same with Jacob, as is Egypt with the land of Ham. Here it is very plainly
shown, that the Egyptian race sprang from the seed of Chain, the son of Noah, whose first-
born was Canaan. So that in those copies wherein in this passage Canaan is read, we must
alter the reading. It is better construed, “was a stranger,” than “dwelt,” as other copies have
it: which would be the same as “was an inhabitant,” for it meaneth nothing different; the
very same word is used in the Greek passage above, where it is said, “Very few, and they
strangers in the land.” Moreover, the state of an incola or accola doth not signify a native,
but a stranger. Behold how “they went from one nation to another.” What had been briefly
proposed, hath been briefly explained in the narration. But from what kingdom they passed
over to another people may well be asked. For they were not yet reigning in the land of
Canaan, because the kingdom of the people of Israel had not yet been established there.
How then can it be understood, except by anticipation, because the kingdom of their seed
was destined there to exist?
15. Next is related what happened in Egypt. “And He increased,” he saith, “His people
exceedingly, and made them stronger than their enemies” (ver. 24). Even the whole of this
is briefly set forth, in order that the manner in which it took place may be afterwards related.
For the people of God was not made stronger than their enemies the Egyptians, at the time
when their male offspring were slain, or when they were worn out with making bricks; but
when by His powerful hand, by the signs and portents of the Lord their God, they became
objects of fear and of honour, until the opposition of the hardened king was overcome, and
the Red Sea overwhelmed the persecutor with his army.
16. “And He turned their heart so, that they hated His people, and dealt untruly with
His servants” (ver. 25). Is it to be in any wise understood or believed, that God turneth man’s
heart to do sin?…For they were not good before they hated His people; but being malignant
and ungodly, they were such as would readily envy their prosperous sojourners. And so, in
that He multiplied His own people, this bountiful act turned the wicked to envy. For envy
is the hatred of another’s prosperity. In this sense, therefore, He turned their heart, so that
through envy they hated His people, and dealt untruly with His servants. It was not then by
making their hearts evil, but by doing good to His people, that He turned their hearts, that
were evil of their own accord, to hatred. For He did not pervert a righteous heart, but turned
one perverted of its own accord to the hatred of His people, while He was to make a good
Psalm CV
use of that evil;4810 not by making them evil, but by lavishing blessings upon those, which
the wicked might most readily envy.
17. The following verses, which are sung in praise of Him when Allelujah is chanted,
show how He used this hatred of theirs, both for the trial of His own people, and for the
glory of His Name, which is profitable for us. “He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom
He had chosen him” (ver. 26). “Whom He had chosen,” would be sufficient; but there is no
difficulty in the addition of “him.” It is a phrase of Scripture, as, “The land in which they
shall dwell in it:”4811 a phrase which the divine pages are full of.
18. “He set forth in them the words of His tokens, and of His wonders in the land of
Ham” (ver. 27). We ought not to understand by “the words of His tokens,” words literally,
words with which the tokens and wonders were worked, that is, which they uttered, that
these tokens and wonders might take place. For many were performed without words, either
with a rod, or with outstretched hand, or by ashes sent towards heaven.…
19. “He sent darkness, and made it dark” (ver. 28). This is also written among the plagues
with which the Egyptians were smitten. But what followeth, is variously read in different
copies. For some have, “and they provoked His words;” while others read, “and they provoked
not His words;” but the reading first mentioned we have found in most; while, where the
negative particle is added, we could hardly discover two copies. But perhaps the false reading
has abounded owing to the easy sense; for what is easier understood than this, “They pro-
voked His words,” that is, by their contumacious rebellions? We have endeavoured to explain
the other reading also according to some true sense: and this for the present occurs: “They
provoked not His words,” that is, in Moses and Aaron; because they most patiently bore
with a very stiffnecked people, until all things which God had determined to work by them,
were fulfilled in order.
20. “He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish” (ver. 29). “He made their
land frogs, yea, even in the king’s chambers” (ver. 30): as if he were to say, He turned their
land into frogs. For there was so great a multitude of frogs, that this might well be said by
hyperbole.
21. “He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies, and lice in all their quarters”
(ver. 31). If it be asked when He spake, it was in His Word before it took place; and there it
was, without time, at what time it should take place: although even then He commanded it
to be done, when it was to be done, through Angels, and through his servants Moses and
Aaron.

Psalm CV
22. He made their rains hail” (ver. 32). It is a similar expression to the former, “He made
their land frogs;” except that the whole land was not actually turned into frogs, though the
whole of the rain may have been turned into hail. “A burning fire in their land:” understand,
“He sent.”
23. “He smote their vines also and fig-trees; and brake every tree of their coasts” (ver.
33). This was done by the violence of the hail, and by lightnings; whence he spoke of the
fire as “burning.”
24. “He spake the word, and the locust came, and the caterpillar, of which there was no
number” (ver. 34). The locusts and the caterpillars are one plague: of which the one is the
parent, the other the offspring.
25. “And did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of the ground”
(ver. 35). Even grass is fruit, as Scripture is wont to speak, which calleth even the ripe corn
grass; but it wished these two things to harmonize in number with the two which it had
spoken of before, that is, the locust and the caterpillar. But the whole of this doth belong to
the variety of speech, which is a remedy for weariness, not to any difference of senses.
26. “He smote every first-born in their land: even the first-fruits of all their strength”
(ver. 36). This is the last plague, excepting the death in the Red Sea. “The first-fruits of all
their strength,” I imagine to be an expression derived from the first-born of cattle. These
plagues are ten in number, but they are not all mentioned, nor in the same order in which
they are there read to have happened. For praise-giving is free from the law which bindeth
one who is relating or composing a history. And since the Holy Spirit is the Author and
Dictator, through the Prophet, of this praise; by the very same authority with which He
guided him who wrote that history, he doth both mention something to have taken place
which is not there read, and passeth over what is there read.
27. Now he addeth this also to the praises of God, that He led the Israelites out of Egypt
enriched with silver and gold; because even they were then in such a condition, that they
could not as yet despise the just and due, though temporal, reward of their toils.…“He
brought them forth also in silver and gold” (ver. 37): this too is a Scripture idiom; for “in
silver and gold” is said for the same as if it had been said “with silver and gold: there was
not one feeble person among their tribes:” in body, not in mind. This also was a great
blessing of God, that in this necessity of removal there was no infirm person.
28. “Egypt was glad at their departing: for their fear fell upon them” (ver. 38); that is,
the fear of the Hebrews upon the Egyptians. For “their fear” is not that with which the
Hebrews feared, but that with which they were feared. Some one will say, how then were
the Egyptians unwilling to dismiss them? why did they let them go as if they expected them
to return? why did they lend them gold and silver, as to men who were to return, and to
repay them, if “Egypt was glad at their departing”? But we must understand, after that final
destruction of the Egyptians, and the terrible overthrow of the mighty pursuing army in the
Psalm CV
Red Sea, that the rest of the Egyptians feared lest the Hebrews should return, and with great
ease crush the relics of them: illustrating what he had stated, that He made His people
stronger than their enemies.
29. He now proceedeth to the divine blessings which were conferred upon them as they
wandered in the desert. “He spread out a cloud to be their covering: and fire to give them
light in the night season” (ver. 39). This is as clear as it is well known.
30. “They asked, and the quail came” (ver. 40). They did not desire quails, but flesh. But
since the quail is flesh, and in this Psalm he speaketh not of the provocation of those who
did not please God, but of the faith of the elect, the true seed of Abraham; they are to be
understood to have desired that that might come which might crush the murmurs of those
who provoked. Then in the next line, “And He filled them with the bread of heaven,” he
has not indeed named manna, but it is obscure to none who hath read those records.
31. “He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places” (ver. 41). This fact too is understood as soon as read.
32. But in all these blessings of His, God doth commend in Abraham the merit of faith.
For the Psalmist goeth on to say, “For why? He remembered His holy promise, which He
made to Abraham His servant” (ver. 42). “And He brought forth His people with joy, and
His chosen with gladness” (ver. 43). What he said, “His people,” he has repeated in, “His
chosen.” So also what he said, “with joy,” he has repeated in, “with gladness.” “And gave
them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people in possession” (ver.
44). “The lands of the heathen,” and “the labours of the people,” are the same; and the words,
“He gave,” are repeated in these, “they took in possession.”
33. …“That they may keep His statutes, and seek out His law” (ver. 45). Lastly, since by
the seed of Abraham he wished those to be understood here, who were truly the seed of
Abraham, such as were not wanting even in that people; as the Apostle Paul clearly showeth,
when he saith, “But not in all of them was God well pleased;”4812 for if He was not pleased
with all, surely there were some in whom He was well pleased: since then this Psalm praiseth
such men as this, he hath said nothing here of the iniquities and provocations and bitterness
of those with whom God was not well pleased. But since not only the justice but also the
mercy of Almighty God, the merciful, was shown even unto the wicked; concerning these
attributes the rest of the Psalm pursueth the praises of God. And yet both sorts were in one
people: nor did the latter pollute the good with the contagion of their iniquities. For “the
Lord knoweth who are His;”4813 and if he cannot separate in this world from wicked men,
yet, “let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”…

Psalm CV
Psalm CVI.4814
1. This Psalm also hath the title Allelujah prefixed to it: and this twice. But some say,
that one Allelujah belongeth to the end of the former Psalm, the other to the beginning of
this. And they assert, that all the Psalms bearing this title have Allelujah at the end, but not
all at the beginning; so that they will not allow any Psalm which hath not Allelujah at the
end, to have it at the beginning; supposing that what seemeth to belong to the commence-
ment, really belongeth to the end of the former Psalm. But until they persuade us by some
sure proofs that this is true, we will follow the general custom, which, whenever it findeth
Allelujah, attributes it to the same Psalm, at the head of which it is found. For there are very
few copies (and I have found this in none of the Greek copies, which I have been able to
inspect) which have Allelujah at the end of the CLth Psalm; after which there is no other
which belongeth to the same canon. But not even this could outweigh custom, although all
the copies had it so. For it might be that, with some reference to the praise of God, the whole
book of Psalms, which is said to consist of five books (for they say that the books severally
end where it is written Amen, Amen), might be closed with this last Allelujah, after all that
hath been sung; nor, on account of the end of the CLth Psalm, do I see that it is necessary
that all the Psalms entitled Allelujah, should have Allelujah at the end. But when there is a
double Allelujah at the head of a Psalm, why as our Lord sometimes once, sometimes twice
over, saith Amen, in the same way Allelujah may not sometimes be used once, sometimes
twice, I know not: especially, since as in this CVth, both the Allelujahs are placed after the
mark by which the number of the Psalm is described, whereas the one, if it belonged to the
end of the former Psalm, ought to have been placed before the number; and the Allelujah
which belonged to the Psalm of this number, should have been written after the number.
But perhaps even in this an ignorant habit hath prevailed, and some reason may be assigned
of which we are as yet uninformed, so that the judgment of truth ought rather to be our
guide than the prejudice of custom. In the mean time, before we are fully instructed in this
matter, whenever we find Allelujah written, whether once or twice, after the number of the
Psalm, according to the most usual custom of the Church, we will ascribe it to that Psalm
to which the same number is prefixed; confessing that we both believe the mysteries of all
the titles in the Psalms, and of the order of the same Psalms, to be important, and that we
have not yet been able, as we wish, to penetrate them.
2. But I find these two Psalms, the CVth and CVIth so connected, that in one of them,
the first, the people of God is praised in the person of the elect, of whom there is no com-
plaint, whom I imagine to have been there in those with whom God was well pleased;4815
but in the following Psalm those are mentioned among the same people who have provoked
4814 Lat. CV.
4815 1 Cor. x. 5.
Psalm CVI
Psalm CVI
God; though the mercy of God was not wanting even to these.…This Psalm therefore begin-
neth like the former; “Confess ye unto the Lord.” But in that Psalm these words follow: “And
call upon His Name:” whereas here, it is as follows, “For He is gracious, and His mercy en-
dureth for ever” (ver. 1). Wherefore in this passage a confession of sins may be understood;
for after a few verses we read, “We have sinned with our fathers, we have done amiss, and
dealt wickedly;” but in the words, “For He is gracious,4816 and His mercy endureth for ever,”
there is chiefly the praise of God, and in His praise confession. Although when any one
confesses his sins, he ought to do so with praise of God; nor is a confession of sins a pious
one, unless it be without despair, and with calling upon the mercy of God. It therefore doth
contain His praise, whether in words, when it calleth Him gracious and merciful, or in the
feeling only, when he believeth this.…If that mercy be here understood, in respect of which
no man can be happy without God; we may render it better, “for ever:” but if it be that mercy
which is shown to the wretched, that they may either be consoled in misery, or even freed
from it; it is better construed, “to the end of the world,” in which there will never be wanting
wretched persons to whom that mercy may be shown. Unless indeed any man ventured to
say, that some mercy of God will not be wanting even to those who shall be condemned
with the devil and his angels; not a mercy by which they may be freed from that condemna-
tion, but that it may be in some degree softened for them: and that thus the mercy of God
may be styled eternal, as exercised over their eternal misery.4817…
3. “Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord?” (ver. 2). Full of the consideration of
the Divine works, while he entreateth His mercy, “Who,” he saith, “can express the mighty
acts of the Lord, or make all His praises heard?” We must supply what was said above, to
make the sense complete here, thus, “Who shall make all His praises heard?” that is, who is
sufficient to make all His praises heard? “Shall make” them “heard,” he saith; that is, cause
that they be heard; showing, that the mighty acts of the Lord and His praises are so to be
spoken of, that they may be preached to those who hear them. But who can make “all,”
heard? Is it that as the next words are, “Blessed are they that alway keep judgment, and do
righteousness in every time” (ver. 3); he perhaps meant those praises of His, which are un-
derstood as His works in His commandments? “For it is God,” saith the Apostle, “who
worketh in you,” 4818…since He worketh in these things in a manner that cannot be spoken.
“Who will do all His praises heard?” that is, who, when he hath heard them, doth all His
praises? which are the works of His commandments. As far as they are done, although all
4816 “Some copies read, ‘for He is gracious,’ others, ‘for He is sweet:’ one Greek word, χρηστὸς, having been
differently translated. Also in the words, ‘for His mercy endureth to the end of the world;’ the Greek hath εἰς
τον αἰῶνα, which may be interpreted ‘for ever.’”
4817 [Luke xii. 47, 48.—C.]
4818 Philip. ii. 13.
Psalm CVI
which are heard are not performed, He is to be praised, who “worketh in us both to will and
to do of His good pleasure.”4819 For this reason, while he might have said, all His command-
ments, or, all the works of His commandments; he preferred saying, “His praises.”…
4. But unless there were some difference between judgment and righteousness, we should
not read in another Psalm, “Until righteousness turn again unto judgment.”4820 The Scrip-
ture, indeed, loveth to place these two words together; as, “Righteousness and judgment are
the habitation of His seat;”4821 and this, “He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the
light, and thy judgment as the noon-day;”4822 where there is apparently a repetition of the
same sentiment. And perhaps on account of the resemblance of signification one may be
put for the other, either judgment for righteousness, or righteousness for judgment: yet, if
they be spoken of in their proper sense, I doubt not that there is some difference; viz. that
he is said to keep judgment who judgeth rightly, but he to do righteousness who acts right-
eously. And I think that the verse, “Until righteousness turn again unto judgment,” may
not absurdly be understood in this sense: that here also those are called blessed, who keep
judgment in faith, and do righteousness in deed.…
5. Next, since God justifieth, that is, maketh men righteous, by healing them from their
iniquities, a prayer followeth: “Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that Thou
bearest unto Thy people” (ver. 4): that is, that we may be among those with whom Thou art
well pleased; since God is not well pleased with them all. “O visit me with Thy salvation.”
This is the Saviour Himself, in whom sins are forgiven, and souls healed, that they may be
able to keep judgment, and do righteousness; and since they who here speak know such
men to be blessed, they pray for this themselves.…“Visit us,” then, “with Thy salvation,”
that is, with Thy Christ. “To see the felicity of Thy chosen, and to rejoice in the gladness of
Thy people” (ver. 5): that is, visit us for this reason with Thy salvation, that we may see the
felicity of Thy chosen, and rejoice in the gladness of Thy people. For “felicity”4823 some
copies read “sweetness;” as in the former passage, “For He is gracious;” where others read,
“for He is sweet.” And it is the same word in the Greek, as is elsewhere read, “The Lord shall
show sweetness:”4824 which some have translated “felicity,” others “bounty.” But what
meaneth, “Visit us to see the felicity of Thy chosen:” that is, that happiness which Thou
givest to Thine elect: except that we may not remain blind, as those unto whom it is said,
“But now ye say we see: therefore your sin remaineth.”4825 For the Lord giveth sight to the

blind,4826 not by their own merits, but in the felicity He giveth to His chosen, which is the
meaning of “the felicity of Thy chosen:” as, the help of my countenance, is not of myself,
but is my God.4827 And we speak of our daily bread, as ours, but we add, Give unto
us.4828…“That Thou mayest be praised with Thine inheritance.” I wonder this verse hath
been so interpreted in many copies, since the Greek phrase is one and the same in these
three verses.…But since this seemeth a doubtful expression, if that sense be true according
to which interpreters have preferred, “That Thou mayest be praised,” the two preceding
verses also must be so understood, because, as I have said, there is one Greek expression in
these three verses; so that the whole should be thus understood, “Visit us with Thy salvation,
that Thou mayest see the felicity of Thy chosen;” that is, visit us for this purpose, that Thou
mayest cause us to be there, and mayest see us there; that “Thou mayest rejoice in the gladness
of Thy people,” that is, that Thou mayest be said to rejoice, since they rejoice in Thee; that
“Thou mayest be praised with Thine inheritance,” that is, mayest be praised with it, since
it may not be praised save for Thy sake.…
6. But let us hear what they next confess: “we have sinned with our fathers: we have
done amiss, and dealt wickedly” (ver. 6). What meaneth “with our fathers”?…“Our fathers,”
he saith, “regarded not Thy wonders in Egypt” (ver. 7); and many other things also, he doth
relate of their sins. Or is, “we have sinned with our fathers,” to be understood as meaning,
we have sinned like our fathers, that is, by imitating their sins? If it be so, it should be sup-
ported by some example of this mode of expression: which did not occur to me when I
sought on this occasion an instance of any one saying that he had sinned, or done anything,
with another, whom he had imitated by a similar act after a long interval of time. What
meaneth then, “Our fathers understood not Thy wonders;” save this, they did not know
what Thou didst wish to convince them of by these miracles? What indeed, save life etern-
al,4829 and a good, not temporal, but immutable, which is waited for only through endurance?
For this reason they impatiently murmured, and provoked, and they asked to be blessed
with present and fugitive blessings, “Neither were they mindful of the greatness of Thy
mercy.” He reproveth both their understanding and memory. Understanding there was
need of, that they might meditate unto what eternal blessings God was calling them through
these temporal ones; and of memory, that at least they might not forget the temporal wonders
which had been wrought, and might faithfully believe, that by the same power which they
had already experienced, God would free them from the persecutions of their enemies;
whereas they forgot the aid which He had given them in Egypt, by means of such wonders,

4829 [A thesis which might be maintained against the brilliant paradox of Warburton.—C.]
Psalm CVI
to crush their enemies. “And they provoked, as they went up to the sea, even to the Red
Sea.”4830 We ought especially to notice how the Scripture doth censure the not understanding
that which ought to have been understood, and the not remembering that which ought to
have been remembered; which men are unwilling to have ascribed to their own fault, for
no other reason than that they may pray less, and be less humble unto God, in whose sight
they should confess what they are, and might by praying for His aid, become what they are
not. For it is better to accuse even the sins of ignorance and negligence, that they may be
done away with, than to excuse them, so that they remain; and it is better to clear them off
by calling upon God, than to clench them by provoking Him.
He addeth, that God acted not according to their unbelief. “Nevertheless,” he saith, “He
saved them for His Name’s sake: that He might make His power to be known” (ver. 8): not
on account of any deservings of their own.
7. “He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up” (ver. 9). We do not read that any
voice was sent forth from Heaven to rebuke the sea; but he hath called the Divine Power by
which this was effected, a rebuke: unless indeed any one may choose to say, that the sea was
secretly rebuked, so that the waters might hear, and yet men could not. The power by which
God acteth is very abstruse and mysterious, a power which He causeth that even things
devoid of sense instantly obey at His will. “So He led them through the deeps, as through a
wilderness.” He calleth a multitude of waters the deeps. For some wishing to give the sense
of this whole verse, have translated, “So He led them forth amid many waters.” What then
doth “through the deeps, as through a wilderness,” mean, except that that had become as a
wilderness from its dryness, where before had been the watery deeps?
8. “And He saved them from the hating ones”4831 (ver. 10). Some translators, in order
to avoid an expression unusual in Latin, have rendered the word, by a circumlocution, “And
He saved them from the hand of those that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand
of the enemy.” What price was given in this redemption? Is it a prophecy, since this deed
was a figure of Baptism, wherein we are redeemed from the hand of the devil at a great price,
which price is the Blood of Christ? whence this is more consistently figured forth, not by
any sea indiscriminately, but by the Red Sea; since blood hath a red colour.
4830 [The author says, “The copy which I was reading from, had the passage thus: And a star had been prefixed
to these two last words, ‘even the Red Sea:’ which doth mark those readings which occur in the Hebrew, and
not in the Septuagint translation. But most of the copies, whether Greek or Latin, which I have been able to inspect,
read thus: ‘and they provoked,’ or, and this is more literally from the Greek, ‘and they wrought bitterness, as
they went up in the Red Sea.’…The word, ‘went up,’ is used, from the position of the land being such, that we
speak of going down from the land of Canaan into Egypt, and of going up from Egypt into it.”—C.]
4831 Odientium.
Psalm CVI
9. “As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not one
of them left” (ver. 11); not of all the Egyptians, but of those who pursued the departing Is-
raelites, desirous either of taking or of killing them.
10. “Then believed they in His words” (ver. 12). The expression seemeth barely Latin,
for he saith not “believed His word,”4832 or “on His words,”4833 but “in His words;”4834 yet
it is very frequent in Scripture. “And praised praise unto Him;” such an expression as when
we say, “This servitude he served,” “such a life he lived.” He is here alluding to that well-
known hymn, commencing, “I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously:
the horse and the rider hath He thrown into the sea.”4835
11. “They acted hastily: they forgot His works” (ver. 13): other copies read more intelli-
gibly, “They hastened, they forgot His works, and would not abide His counsel.” For they
ought to have thought, that so great works of God towards themselves were not without a
purpose, but that they invited them to some endless happiness, which was to be waited for
with patience; but they hastened to make themselves happy with temporal things, which
give no man true happiness, because they do not quench insatiable longing: for “whosoever,”
saith our Lord, “shall drink of this water, shall thirst again.”4836
12. Lastly, “And they lusted a lust in the wilderness, and they tempted God in the dry
land” (ver. 14). The “dry land,” or land without water, and “desert,” are the same: so also
are, “they lusted a lust,” and, “they tempted God.” The form of speech is the same as above,
“they praised a praise.”4837
13. “And He gave them their desire, and sent fulness withal into their souls” (ver. 15).
But He did not thus render them happy: for it was not that fulness of which it is said, “Blessed
are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.”4838 In this
passage he doth not speak of the rational soul, but of the soul as giving animal life to the
body; to the substance of which belong meat and drink, according to what is said in the
Gospel, “Is not the soul more than meat, and the body than raiment?”4839 as if it belonged
to the soul to eat, to the body to be clothed.

14. “And they angered Moses in the tents, and Aaron the saint of the Lord” (ver. 16).
What angering, or, as some have more literally rendered it, what provocation,4840 he
speaketh of, the following words sufficiently show.
15. “The earth opened,” he saith, “and swallowed up Dathan, and covered over the
congregation of Abiram” (ver. 17): “swallowed up” answereth to “covered over.” Both
Dathan and Abiram were equally concerned in a most sacrilegious schism.4841
16. “And the fire was kindled in their company; the flame burnt up the sinners” (ver.
18). This word is not in Scripture usually applied to those, who, although they live righteously,
and in a praiseworthy manner, are not without sin. Rather, as there is a difference between
those who scorn and scorners, between men who murmur and murmurers, between men
who are writing and writers, and so forth; so Scripture is wont to signify by sinners such as
are very wicked, and laden with heavy loads of sins.
17. “And they made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the graven image” (ver. 19). “Thus
they changed their glory, in the similitude of a calf that eateth hay” (ver. 20). He saith not
“into” the likeness, but “in” the likeness. It is such a form of speech as where he said “and
they believed in His words.”4842 With great effect in truth he saith not, they changed the
glory of God when they did this; as the Apostle also saith, “They changed the glory of the
incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man:”4843 but “their glory.” For
God was their glory, if they would abide His counsel, and hasten not.…
18. “They forgat God who saved them” (ver. 21). How did He save them? “Who did so
great things in Egypt: Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and fearful things in the Red
Sea” (ver. 22). The things that are wondrous, are also fearful; for there is no wonder without
a certain fear: although these might be called fearful, because they beat down their adversaries,
and showed them what they ought to fear.
19. “So He said, He would have destroyed them” (ver. 23). Since they forgot Him who
saved them, the Worker of wondrous works, and made and worshipped a graven image, by
this atrocious and incredible impiety they deserved death. “Had not Moses His chosen stood
before Him in the breaking.” He doth not say, that he stood in the breaking,4844 as if to
break the wrath of God, but in the way of the breaking, meaning the stroke which was to
strike them: that is, had he not put himself in the way for them, saying, “Yet now, if Thou
wilt forgive their sin;—and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book.” Where it is proved

Psalm CVI
how greatly the intercession of the saints in behalf of others prevaileth with God. For Moses,
fearless in the justice of God, which could not blot him out, implored mercy, that He would
not blot out those whom He justly might. Thus he “stood before Him in the breaking, to
turn away His wrathful indignation, lest He should destroy them.”
20. “Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land” (ver. 24). But had they seen it? How
then could they scorn that which they had not seen, except as the following words explain,
“and believed not in His words.” Indeed, unless that land which was styled the land that
flowed with milk and honey,4845 signified something great, through which, as by a visible
token, He was leading those who understood His wondrous works to invisible grace and
the kingdom of heaven, they could not be blamed for scorning that land, whose temporal
kingdom we also ought to esteem as nothing, that we may love that Jerusalem which is free,
the mother of us all,4846 which is in heaven, and truly to be desired. But rather unbelief is
here reproved, since they gave no credence to the words of God, who was leading them to
great things through small things, and hastening to bless themselves with temporal things,
which they carnally savoured of, they “abided not His counsel,” as is said above.
21. “But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord” (ver.
25); who strongly forbade them to murmur.
22. “Then lift He up His hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness” (ver.
26); “to cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands” (ver. 27).
23. “They were initiated also unto Baalpeor;” that is, were consecrated to the Gentile
idol; “and ate the offerings of the dead” (ver. 28). “Thus they provoked Him to anger with
their own inventions; and destruction was multiplied among them” (ver. 29). As if He had
deferred the lifting up of His hand which was to cast them down in the desert, and to cast
out their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands; as the Apostle saith: “And
even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate
mind, to do those things which are not convenient.”4847 “‘Destruction,’ therefore, ‘was
multiplied among them,’ when they were heavily punished for their heavy sins.”
24. “Then stood up Phineas, and appeased Him, and the shaking ceased” (ver. 30). He
hath related the whole briefly, because he is not here teaching the ignorant, but reminding
those who know the history. The word “shaking” here is the same as “breaking” before. For
it is one word in the Greek. Lastly, so great was their wickedness, in being consecrated to
the idol, and eating the sacrifices of the dead (that is, because the Gentiles4848 sacrificed to
dead men as to God), that God would not be otherwise appeased than as Phineas the Priest

appeased Him, when he slew a man and a woman together whom he found in adultery.4849
If he had done this from hatred towards them, and not from love, while zeal for the house
of God devoured him, it would not have been counted unto him for righteousness.…Christ
our Lord indeed, when the New Testament was revealed, chose a milder discipline; but the
threat of hell is more severe, and this we do not read of in those threatenings held out by
God in His temporal government.
25. “And that was counted unto him for righteousness among all posterities for evermore”
(ver. 31). God counted this unto His Priest for righteousness, not only as long as posterity
shall exist, but “for evermore;” for He who knoweth the heart, knoweth how to weigh with
how much love for the people that deed was done.
26. “And they angered Him at the waters of strife: so that Moses was vexed for their
sakes” (ver. 32); “because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake doubtfully4850 with his
lips” (ver. 33). What is spake doubtfully? As if God, who had done so great wonders before,
could not cause water to flow from a rock. For he touched the rock with his rod with doubt,
and thus distinguished this miracle from the rest, in which he had not doubted. He thus
offended, thus deserved to hear that he should die, without entering into the land of prom-
ise.4851 For being disturbed by the murmurs of an unbelieving people, he held not fast that
confidence which he ought to have held. Nevertheless, God giveth unto him, as unto His
chosen, a good testimony even after his death, so that we may see that this wavering of faith
was punished with this penalty only, that he was not allowed to enter that land, whither he
was leading the people.…
27. But they of whose iniquities this Psalm speaketh, when they had entered into that
temporal land of promise, “destroyed not the heathen, which the Lord commanded them”
(ver. 34); “but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works” (ver. 35). “In-
somuch that they worshipped their idols, which became to them an offence” (ver. 36). Their
not destroying them, but mingling with them, became to them an offence.
28. “Yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils” (ver. 37); “and shed
innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they offered
unto the idols of Canaan” (ver. 38). That history doth not relate that they offered their sons
and daughters to devils and idols; but neither can that Psalm lie, nor the Prophets, who assert
this in many passages of their rebukes. But the literature of the Gentiles is not silent respecting
this custom of theirs. But what is it that followeth? “And the land was slain with bloods.”
We might suppose that this was a mistake of the writer, and that he had written interfecta
for infecta, were it not for the goodness of God, who hath willed His Scriptures to be written
4849 Numb. xxv. 8.
4850 Distinxit.
4851 Deut. xxxii. 49–52.
Psalm CVI
in many languages; were it not that we see it written as in the text in many Greek 4852 copies
which we have inspected; “the land was slain with bloods.” What meaneth then, “the land
was slain,” unless this be referred to the men who dwelt in the land, by a metaphorical ex-
pression.…For they themselves were slaying their own souls when they offered up their
sons, and when they shed the blood of infants who were far from consent to this crime:
whence it is said, “They shed innocent blood.” “The land” therefore “was slain with bloods,
and defiled by their works” (ver. 39), since they themselves were slain in soul, and defiled
by their works; “and they went a whoring after their own inventions.” By inventions are
meant what the Greeks call ἐπιτηδεύματα: for this word doth occur in the Greek copies
both in this and a former passage, where it is said, “They provoked Him to anger with their
own inventions;” “inventions” in both instances signifying what they had initiated others
in. Let no man therefore suppose inventions to mean what they had of themselves instituted,
without any example before them to imitate. Whence other translators in the Latin tongue
have preferred pursuits, affections, imitations, pleasures, to inventions: and the very same
who here write inventions, have elsewhere written pursuits. I chose to mention this, lest the
word inventions, applied to what they had not invented, but imitated from others, might
raise a difficulty.
29. “Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His own people” (ver. 40). Our
translators have been unwilling to use the word anger, for the Greek θυμὸς; though some
have used it; while others translate by “indignation” or “mind.”4853 Whichever of these
terms be adopted, passion doth not affect God; but the power of punishing hath assumed
this name metaphorically from custom.
30. “Insomuch that He abhorred His own inheritance; and He gave them over into the
hand of the heathen: and they that hated them were lords over them” (ver. 41): “and their
enemies oppressed them, and they were brought low under their hands” (ver. 42). Since he
hath called them the inheritance of God, it is clear that He abhorred them, and gave them
over into their enemies’ hands, not in order to their perdition, but for their discipline. Lastly,
he saith, “Many a time did He deliver them.” “But they provoked Him with their own
counsels” (ver. 43). This is what he said above, “They did not abide His counsel.” Now a
man’s counsel is pernicious to himself, when he seeketh those things which are his own
only, not those which are God’s.4854 In whose inheritance, which inheritance He Himself
is to us, when He deigneth His presence for our enjoyment, being with the Saints, we shall
suffer no straitening from the society, by our love of anything as our own possession. For
that most glorious city, when it hath gained the promised inheritance, in which none shall

Psalm CVI
die, none shall be born, will not contain citizens who shall individually rejoice in their own,
for “God shall be all in all.” 4855 And whoever in this pilgrimage faithfully and earnestly
doth long for this society, doth accustom himself to prefer common to private interests, by
seeking not his own things, but Jesus Christ’s: lest, by being wise and vigilant in his own
affairs, he provoke God with his own counsel; but, hoping for what he seeth not, let him
not hasten to be blessed with things visible; and, patiently waiting for that everlasting hap-
piness which he seeth not, follow His counsel in His promises, whose aid he prayeth for in
his prayers. Thus he will also become humble in his confessions; so as not to be like those,
of whom it is said, “They were brought down in their wickedness.”
31. Nevertheless, God, full of mercy, forsook them not. “And He saw when they were
in adversity, when He heard their complaint” (ver. 44). “And He thought upon His covenant,
and repented, according to the multitude of His mercies” (ver. 45). He saith, “He repented,”
because He changed that wherewith He seemed about to destroy them. With God indeed
all things are arranged and fixed; and when He seemeth to act upon sudden motive, He doth
nothing but what He foreknew that He should do from eternity; but in the temporal changes
of creation, which He ruleth wonderfully, He, without any temporal change in Himself, is
said to do by a sudden act of will what in the ordained causes of events He hath arranged
in the unchangeableness of His most secret counsel, according to which He doth everything
according to defined seasons, doing the present, and having already done the future. And
who is capable of comprehending these things?4856 Let us therefore hear the Scripture,
speaking high things humbly, giving food for the nourishment of children, and proposing
subjects for the research of the older: that everlasting covenant “which He made with Abra-
ham,” not the old which is abolished, but the new which is hidden even in the old. “And
pitied them,” etc. He did that which He had covenanted, but He had foreknown that He
would yield this to them when they prayed in their adversity; since even their very prayer,
when it was not uttered, but was still to be uttered, undoubtedly was known unto God.
32. So “He gave them unto compassions, in the sight of all that had taken them captive”
(ver. 46). That they might not be vessels of wrath, but vessels of mercy.4857 The compassions
unto which He gave them are named in the plural for this reason, I imagine, because each
one hath a gift of his own from God, one in one way, another in another.4858 Come then,
whosoever readest this, and dost recognise the grace of God, by which we are redeemed
unto eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, by reading in the apostolical writings, and
by searching in the Prophets, and seest the Old Testament revealed in the New, the New

veiled in the Old; remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, where, when He driveth
him out of the hearts of the faithful, He saith, “Now is the prince of this world cast out:”
4859 and again of the Apostle, when he saith, “Who hath delivered us from the power of
darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.”4860 Meditate on these
and such like things, examine also the Old Testament, and see what is sung in that Psalm,
the title of which is, When the temple was being built after the captivity:4861 for there it is
said, “Sing unto the Lord a new song.” And, that thou mayest not think it doth refer to the
Jewish people only, he saith, “Sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth: sing unto the Lord,
and praise His Name: declare,” or rather, “give the good news of,” or, to transfer the very
word used in the Greek, “evangelize day from day, His salvation.” Here the Gospel (Evan-
gelium) is mentioned, in which is announced the Day that came from Day, our Lord Christ,
the Light from Light, the Son from the Father. This also is the meaning of His salvation: for
Christ is the Salvation of God, as we have shown above.4862…
33. “Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations (other copies
read, “from the heathen”); that we may give thanks unto Thy holy Name, and make our
boast of Thy praise” (ver. 47). Then he hath briefly added this very praise, “Blessed be the
Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and world without end”4863 (ver. 48): by which we
understand from everlasting to everlasting; because He shall be praised without end by those
of whom it is said, “Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house: they will be alway praising
Thee.”4864 This is the perfection of the Body of Christ on the third day, when the devils had
been cast out, and cures perfected, even unto the immortality of the body itself, the everlasting
reign of those who perfectly praise Him, because they perfectly love Him; and perfectly love
Him, because they behold Him face to face. For then shall be completed the prayer at the
commencement of this Psalm:4865 “Remember us, O Lord, according to the favour that
Thou bearest unto Thy people,” etc. For from the Gentiles He doth not gather only the lost
sheep of the house of Israel,4866 but also those which do not belong to that fold; so that there
is one flock, as is said, and one Shepherd. But when the Jews suppose that that prophecy
belongeth to their visible kingdom, because they know not how to rejoice in the hope of
good things unseen, they are about to rush into the snares of him, of whom the Lord saith,

Psalm CVI
“I am come in My Father’s Name, and ye receive Me not: if another shall come in his own
name, him ye will receive.” 4867 Of whom the Apostle Paul saith: “that Man of Sin shall be
revealed, the son of perdition,” etc. And a little after he saith, “Then shall that Wicked be
revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with
the brightness of His coming,” etc.4868…Through that Apostate, through him who exalteth
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, it seemeth to me, that the carnal
people of Israel will suppose that prophecy to be fulfilled, where it is said, “Deliver us, O
Lord, and gather us from among the heathen;” that under His guidance, before the eyes of
their visible enemies, who had visibly taken them captive, they are to have visible glory.
Thus they will believe a lie, because they have not received the love of truth, that they might
love not carnal, but spiritual blessings.…For Christ had other sheep that were not of this
fold:4869 but the devil and his angels had taken captive all those sheep, both among the Is-
raelites and the Gentiles. The power, therefore, of the devil having been cast out of them,
in the sight of the evil spirits who had taken them captive, their cry in this prophecy is, that
they may be saved and perfected for evermore: “Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us
from among the heathen.” Not, as the Jews imagine it, fulfilled through Antichrist, but
through our Lord Christ coming in the name of His Father, “Day from day, His salvation;”
of whom it is here said, “O visit us in Thy salvation! And let all the people say,” the pre-
destined people of the circumcision and of the uncircumcision, a holy race, an adopted
people, “So be it! So be it!”4870

Psalm CVI
Psalm CVII.4871
1. This Psalm commendeth unto us the mercies of God, proved in ourselves, and is
therefore the sweeter to the experienced. And it is a wonder if it can be pleasing to any one,
except to him who has learned in his own case, what he hears in this Psalm. Yet was it
written not for any one or two, but for the people of God, and set forth that it might know
itself therein as in a mirror. Its title needeth not now to be treated, for it is Halleluia, and
again Halleluia. Which we have a custom of singing at a certain time in our solemnities,
after an old tradition of the Church: nor is it without a sacred meaning that we sing it on
particular days.4872 Halleluia we sing indeed on certain days,4873 but every day we think it.
For if in this word is signified the praise of God, though not in the mouth of the flesh, yet
surely in the mouth of the heart. “His praise shall ever be in my mouth.”4874 But that the
title hath Halleluia not once only but twice, is not peculiar to this Psalm, but the former also
hath it so. And as far as appears from its text, that was sung of the people of Israel, but this
is sung of the universal Church of God, spread through the whole world. Perchance, it not
unfitly hath Halleluia twice, because we cry, Abba, Father. Since Abba is nothing else but
Father, yet not without meaning the Apostle said, “in whom we cry, Abba, Father;” 4875 but
because one wall indeed coming to the Corner Stone crieth Abba, but the other, from the
other side crieth Father; viz., in that Corner Stone, “who is our Peace, who hath made both
one.”…
2. “Confess unto the Lord that He is sweet, because for aye in His mercy” (ver. 1). This
confess ye that He is sweet: if ye have tasted, confess. But he cannot confess, who hath not
chosen to taste, for whence shall he say that that is sweet, which he knoweth not. But ye if
ye have tasted how sweet the Lord is,4876 “Confess ye to the Lord that He is sweet.” If ye
have tasted with eagerness, break forth4877 with confession. “For aye is His mercy,” that is,
for ever. For here “for aye,” is so put, since also in some other places of Scripture, for aye,
that is, what in Greek is called εἰς αἰῶνα, is understood for ever. For His mercy is not for
a time, so as not to be for ever, since for this purpose His present mercy is over men, that
they may live with the Angels for ever.
3. “Let them say who are redeemed of the Lord, whom He hath redeemed from the hand
of their enemies” (ver. 2). Redeemed indeed it seems was also the people of Israel from the
4871 Lat. CVI.

land of Egypt, from the hand of slavery, from fruitless labours, from miry works; yet let us
see whether those who say these things, are they who were freed by the Lord from Egypt. It
is not so. But who are they? “Those whom He redeemed.” Still one might take it also of
them, as redeemed from the hand of their enemies, that is, of the Egyptians. Let them be
expressed exactly who they are, for whom this Psalm would be sung. “He gathered them
from the lands;” these might still be the lands of Egypt, for there are many lands even in one
province. Let him speak openly. “From the east and the west, from the north and the sea”
(ver. 3). Now then we understand these redeemed, in the whole circle of the earth. This
people of God, freed from a great and broad Egypt, is led, as through the Red Sea,4878 that
in Baptism it may make an end of its enemies. For by the sacrament as it were of the Red
Sea, that is by Baptism consecrated with the Blood of Christ, the pursuing Egyptians, the
sins, are washed away.…“But all these things happened to them in a figure, and were written
for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.”4879…
4. “They wandered in the wilderness, in a dry place, they found not the way of a city to
dwell in” (ver. 4). We have heard a wretched wandering; what of want? “Hungry and thirsty,
their soul fainted in them” (ver. 5). But wherefore did it faint? for what good? For God is
not cruel, but He maketh Himself known, in that it is expedient for us, that He be entreated
by us fainting, and that aiding us He be loved. And therefore after this wandering, and
hunger, and thirst, “And they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them
out of their distress” (ver. 6). And what did He for them, as they were wandering? “And He
led them in the right way” (ver. 7). They found not the way of a city to dwell in, with hunger
and thirst they were vexed and faint, “and He led them into the right way, that they might
go into a city to dwell in.” How He helped their hunger and thirst, He saith not, but even
this expect ye: “Let them confess unto the Lord His mercies, and His wonders towards the
children of men” (ver. 8). Tell them, ye that are experienced, to the inexperienced; ye that
are already in the way, already directed towards finding the city, already at last free from
hunger and thirst. “Because He hath satisfied the empty soul, and filled the hungry soul with
good things” (ver. 9).
5. “Them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, fast bound in beggary and
iron” (ver. 10). Whence this, but that thou wast attributing things to thyself? that thou wast
not owning the grace of God? that thou wast rejecting the counsel of God4880 concerning
thee? For see what He addeth: “Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord through
pride” (ver. 11), not knowing the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their
own,4881 “and they were bitter against the counsel of the Most High.” “And their heart was

brought low in labour” (ver. 12). And now fight against lust; if God cease to aid thou mayest
strive, thou canst not conquer. And when thou shalt be pressed by thine evil, thy heart will
be brought low in labour, so that now with humbled heart thou mayest learn to cry out, “O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”4882…Freed,
thou wilt confess the mercies of the Lord. “And they cried unto the Lord when they were
troubled, and He delivered them out of their distresses” (ver. 13). They were freed from the
second temptation. There remains that of weariness and loathing. But first see what He did
for them when freed. “And He led them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake
their bonds asunder” (ver. 14). “Let them confess to the Lord His mercies, and His wonders
to the children of men” (ver. 15). Wherefore? what difficulties hath He overcome? “Because
He brake the gates of brass, and snapped the bars of iron” (ver. 16). “He took them up from
the way of their iniquity, for because of their unrighteousnesses they were brought low”
(ver. 17). Because they gave honour to themselves, not to God, because they were establishing
their own righteousness, not knowing the righteousness of God,4883 they were brought low.
They found that they were helpless without His aid, who were presuming on their own
strength alone.
6. “Their soul abhorred all manner of meat” (ver. 18). Now they suffer satiety. They are
sick of satiety. They are in danger from satiety. Unless perchance thou thinkest they could
be killed with famine, but cannot with satiety. See what followeth. When he had said, “Their
soul abhorred all manner of meat,” lest thou shouldest think them, as it were, safe of their
fulness, and not rather see that they would die of satiety: “And they came near,” he saith,
“even unto the gates of death.” What then remaineth? That even when the word of God
delighteth thee, thou account it not to thyself; nor for this be puffed up with any sort of ar-
rogance, and having an appetite for food, proudly spurn at those who are in danger from
satiety. “And they cried out unto the Lord when they were in trouble, and He delivered them
out of their distresses” (ver. 19). And because it was a sickness not to be pleased, “He sent
His Word, and healed them” (ver. 20). See what evil there is in satiety; see whence He delivers,
to whom he crieth that loathes his food. “He sent His Word, and healed them, and snatched
them,” from whence? not from wandering, not from hunger, not from the difficulty of
overcoming sins, but “from their corruption.” It is a sort of corruption of the mind to loathe
what is sweet. Therefore also of this benefit, as of the others before, “Let them confess to the
Lord His mercies, and His wonders unto the sons of men” (ver. 21). “And sacrifice the sac-
rifice of praise” (ver. 22). For now that He may be praised, the Lord is sweet, “and let them
tell out His works with gladness.” Not with weariness, not with sadness, not with anxiety,
not with loathing, but “with gladness.”
4882 Rom. vii. 24.
4883 Rom. x. 3.
Psalm CVII
7. …“They who go down on the sea in ships, doing their business on the mighty waters”
(ver. 23); that is, amongst many peoples. For that waters are often put for peoples, the
Apocalypse of John is witness, when on John’s asking what those waters were, it was answered
him, they are peoples. They then who do their business on mighty waters, “they have seen
the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep” (ver. 24). For what is deeper than human
hearts? hence often break forth winds; storms of sedition, and dissensions, disturb the ship.
And what is done in them? God, willing that both they who steer, and they who are conveyed,
should cry unto Him, “He spake, and the breath of the storm stood” (ver. 25). What is,
stood? Abode, continued, still disturbeth, long tosseth; rageth, and passeth not away. “For
He spake, and the breath of the storm stood.” And what did that breath of the storm? “They
go up even to the heavens,” in daring; “They go down even into the deeps” (ver. 26), in
fearing. “Their soul wasted in miseries.” “They were disturbed, and moved like a drunken
man” (ver. 27). They who sit at the helm, and they who faithfully love the ship, feel what I
say. Certainly, when they speak, when they read, when they interpret, they appear wise. Woe
for the storm! “and all their wisdom,” he saith, “was swallowed up.” Sometimes all human
counsels fail; whichever way one turns himself, the waves roar, the storm rageth, the arms
are powerless: where the prow may strike, to what wave the side may be exposed, whither
the stricken ship may be allowed to drift, from what rocks she must be kept back lest she be
lost, is impossible for her pilots to see. And what is left but that which follows? “And they
cried out unto the Lord when they were troubled, and He delivered them from their dis-
tresses” (ver. 28). “And He commanded the storm, and it stood unto clear air” (ver. 29),
“and the waves of it were still.” Hear on this point the voice of a steersman, one that was in
peril, was brought low, was freed. “I would not,” he saith, “have you ignorant, brethren, of
our distress, which befell us in Asia, that “we were pressed above strength, and above
measure” (I see all his “wisdom swallowed up”), “so that we were weary,” he saith, “even of
life.”4884…
“And they were glad, because they were still, and He brought them into the haven of
their desire” (ver. 30). “Let His mercies confess unto the Lord, and His wonders towards
the sons of men” (ver. 31). Everywhere, without exception, let not our merits, not our
strength, not our wisdom, “confess unto the Lord,” but, “His mercies.” Let Him be loved in
every deliverance of ours, who has been invoked in every distress.
8. “And let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the seat of
the elders” (ver. 32). Let them exalt, let them praise, peoples and elders, merchants and pilots.
For what hath He done in this assembly? What hath He established? Whence hath He rescued
it? What hath He granted it? Even as He resisted the proud, and gave grace to the humble:4885
4884 2 Cor. i. 8.
4885 Jas. iv. 6.
Psalm CVII
the proud, that is, the first people of the Jews, arrogant, and extolling itself on its descent
from Abraham, and because to that nation “were entrusted the oracles of God.”4886 These
things did not avail them unto soundness, but unto pride of heart, rather to swelling than
to greatness. What then did God, resisting the proud, but giving grace to the humble; cutting
off the natural branches for their pride; grafting in the wild olive for its humility?
“He made the rivers a wilderness” (ver. 33). Waters did run there, prophecies were in
course. Seek now a prophet among the Jews; thou findest none. For “He made the outgoings
of waters to be thirst.” Let them say, “Now there is no prophet more, and He will not know
us any more.”4887 “A fruitful land to be saltpools” (ver. 34). Thou seekest there the faith of
Christ, thou findest not: thou seekest a prophet, thou findest not: thou seekest a sacrifice,
thou findest not: thou seekest a temple, thou findest none. Wherefore this? “From the
wickedness of them that dwell therein.” Behold how He resisteth the proud: hear how He
giveth grace to the humble. “He made the wilderness to be a standing water, and the dry
ground to be outgoings of waters” (ver. 35). “And He caused the hungry to dwell there”
(ver. 36). Because to Him it was said, “Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melch-
izedec.”4888 For thou seekest a sacrifice among the Jews; thou hast none after the order of
Aaron. Thou seekest it after the order of Melchizedec; thou findest it not among them, but
through the whole world it is celebrated in the Church. “From the rising of the sun to the
setting thereof the name of the Lord is praised.”4889…“And they sowed fields, and planted
vineyards, and gat fruit of corn” (ver. 37): at which that workman rejoiceth, who saith, “Not
because I desire a gift, but I seek fruit.”4890 “And He blessed them, and they were multiplied
exceedingly, and their cattle were not diminished” (ver. 38). This standeth. For “the found-
ation of God standeth sure; because the Lord knoweth them that are His.”4891 They are
called “beasts of burden,” and “cattle,” that walk simply in the Church, yet are useful; not
much learned, but full of faith. Therefore, whether spiritual or carnal, “He blessed them.”
9. “And they became few, and were vexed” (ver. 39). Whence this? From athwart? Nay,
from within. For that they should “become few,” “They went out from us, but they were not
of us.”4892 But therefore he speaketh as of these, of whom he spake before, that they may
be discerned with understanding; because he speaketh as if of the same, because of the sac-
raments they have in common. For they belong to the people of God, though not by the

virtue, yet surely by the appearance of piety: for concerning them we have heard the Apostle,
“In the last times there shall come grievous times, for there shall be men lovers of themselves.”
4893 The first evil is, “lovers of themselves;” that is, as being pleased with themselves. Would
that they were not pleasing to themselves, and were pleasing to God: would that they would
cry out in their difficulties, and be freed from their distresses. But while they presumed
greatly on themselves, “they were made few.” It is manifest, brethren: all who separate
themselves from unity become few. For they are many; but in unity, while they are not
parted from unity. For when the multitude of unity hath begun no more to belong to them,
in heresy and schism, they are few. “And they were vexed, from distress of miseries and
grief.” “Contempt was poured on princes” (ver. 40). For they were rejected by the Church
of God, and the more because they wished to be princes, therefore they were despised, and
became salt that had lost its savour, cast out abroad, so that it is trodden under foot of men.
4894 “And He led them astray in the pathless place, and not in a way.” Those above in the
way, those directed to a city, and finally led thither, not led astray; but these, where there
was no way, led astray. What is, “Led them astray”? God “gave them up to their own hearts’
lusts.”4895 For “led astray” means this, gave them up to themselves. For if thou enquire
closely, it is they that lead themselves astray.…“And He helped the poor out of beggary”
(ver. 41). What meaneth this, brethren? Princes are despised, and the poor helped. The
proud are cast aside, and the humble provided for.…“And made him households like sheep.”
Thou understandest one poor man and one beggar of him concerning whom he said, “He
hath helped the poor out of misery:” this poor man is now many households, this poor man
is many nations; many Churches are one Church, one nation, one household, one sheep.
These are great mysteries, great types, how profound, how full of hidden meanings; how
sweetly discovered, since long hidden. Therefore, “the righteous will consider this, and rejoice:
and the mouth of all wickedness shall be stopped” (ver. 42). That wickedness that doth prate
against unity, and compelleth truth to be made manifest, shall be convicted, and have its
mouth stopped.
10. “Who is wise? and he will consider these things; and will understand the mercies of
the Lord” (ver. 43).…Not his own deservings, not his own strength, not his own power; but
“the mercies of the Lord;” who, when he was wandering and in want, led him back to the
path, and fed him; who, when he was struggling against the difficulties of his sins, and bound
down with the fetters of habit, released and freed him; who, when he loathed the Word of

God, and was almost dying with a kind of weariness, restored him by sending him the
medicine of His Word; who, when he was endangered among the risks of shipwreck and
storm, stilled the sea, and brought him into port; who, finally, placed him in that people,
where He giveth grace to the humble; not in that where he resisteth the proud; and hath
made him His own, that remaining within he may be multiplied, not that going out he may
be minished. The righteous see this, and rejoice. “The mouth,” therefore, “of all wickedness
shall be stopped.”
Psalm CVII
Psalm CVIII.4896
1. I have not thought that the CVIIIth Psalm required an exposition; since I have already
expounded it in the LVIIth Psalm,4897 and in the LXth, of the last divisions of which this
Psalm consisteth. For the last part of the LVIIth is the first of this, as far as the verse, “Thy
glory is above all the earth.” Henceforth to the end, is the last part of the LXth: as the last
part of the CXXXVth is the same as that of the CXVth,4898 from the verse, “The images of
the heathen are but gold and silver:” as the XIVth[4899] and LIIId,4899 with a few alterations
in the middle, have everything the same from the beginning to the end. Whatever slight
differences therefore occur in this CVIIIth Psalm, compared with those two, of parts of
which it is composed, are easy to understand; just as we find in the LVIIth,4900 “I will sing
and give praise; awake, O my glory:” here,“ I will sing and give praise, with my glory.”4901
Awake, is said there, that he may sing and give praise therewith. Also, there, “Thy mercy is
great” (or, as some translate, “is lifted up”) “unto the heavens;”4902 but here, “Thy mercy is
great above the heavens.”4903 For it is great unto the heavens, that it may be great in the
heavens; and this is what he wished to express by “above the heavens.” Also in the LXth, “I
will rejoice, I will divide Shechem:”4904 here “I will be exalted, and will divide Shechem.”4905
Where is shown what is signified in the division of Shechem, which it was prophesied should
happen after the Lord’s exaltation, and that this joy doth refer to that exaltation; so that He
rejoiceth, because He is exalted. Whence he elsewhere saith, “Thou hast turned my heaviness
into joy; Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness.”4906 Also there
“Ephraim, the strength of my head:”4907 but here, “Ephraim the taking up of my head.”4908
But strength cometh from taking up, that is, He maketh men strong by taking up, causing
fruit in us; for the interpretation of Ephraim is, bearing fruit. But “taking up” may be under-
stood of us, when we take up Christ; or of Christ, when He, who is Head of the Church,

taketh us up. And the words, “them that trouble us,” in the former Psalm,4909 are the same
with “our enemies,” in this.4910
2. We are taught by this Psalm, that those titles which seem to refer to history are most
rightly understood prophetically, according to the object of the composition of the
Psalms.…And yet this Psalm is composed of the latter portions of two,4911 whose titles are
different. Where it is signified that each concur in a common object, not in the surface of
the history, but in the depth of prophecy, the objects of both being united in this one, the
title of which is, “A Song or Psalm of David:”4912 resembling neither of the former titles,
otherwise than in the word David. Since, “in many places, and in diverse manners,” as the
Epistle to the Hebrews saith, “God spoke in former times to the fathers through the Proph-
ets;”4913 yet He spoke of Him whom He sent afterwards, that the words of the Prophets
might be fulfilled: for “all the promises of God in Him are yea.”4914

Psalm CVIII
Psalm CIX.4915
1. Every one who faithfully readeth the Acts of the Apostles, acknowledgeth that this
Psalm containeth a prophecy of Christ; for it evidently appeareth that what is here written,
“let his days be few, and let another take his office,” is prophesied of Judas, the betrayer of
Christ.…For as some things are said which seem peculiarly to apply to the Apostle Peter,
and yet are not clear in their meaning, unless when referred to the Church, whom he is ac-
knowledged to have figuratively represented, on account of the primacy4916 which he bore
among the Disciples; as it is written, “I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heav-
en,”4917 and other passages of the like purport: so Judas doth represent those Jews who were
enemies of Christ, who both then hated Christ, and now, in their line of succession, this
species of wickedness continuing, hate Him. Of these men, and of this people, not only may
what we read more openly discovered in this Psalm be conveniently understood, but also
those things which are more expressly stated concerning Judas himself.
2. The Psalm, then, beginneth thus: “O God, be not silent as to my praise; for the mouth
of the ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me” (ver. 1). Whence it ap-
peareth, both that the blame, which the ungodly and the deceitful is not silent of, is false,
and that the praise, which God is not silent of, is true. “For God is true, but every man a li-
ar;”4918 for no man is true, except him in whom God speaketh. But the highest praise is that
of the only-begotten Son of God, in which He is proclaimed even that which He is, the only-
begotten Son of God. But this did not appear, but, when His weakness appeared, lay hid,
when the mouth of the ungodly and deceitful was opened upon Him; and for this reason
his mouth was opened, because His virtue was concealed: and he saith, “the mouth of the
deceitful was opened,” because the hatred which was covered by deceit burst out into lan-
guage.
3. “They have spoken against me with false tongues” (ver. 2): then chiefly when they
praised him as a “good Master” with insidious adulation. Whence it is elsewhere said: “and
they that praised me, are sworn together against me.”4919 Next, because they burst into
cries, “Crucify Him, crucify Him;”4920 he hath added, “They compassed me about also with
words of hatred.” They who with a treacherous tongue spoke words seemingly of love, and
4915 Lat. CVIII.

not of hatred, “against me,” since they did this insidiously; afterwards “compassed me about
with words” not of false and deceitful love, but of open “hatred, and fought against me
without a cause.” For as the pious love Christ for nought, so do the wicked hate Him for
nought; for as truth is earnestly sought by the best men on its own account, without any
advantage, external to itself, in view, so is wickedness sought by the worst men. Whence
among secular authors it is said of a very bad man, “he was wicked and cruel for no ob-
ject.”4921
4. “In place,” saith he, “of loving me, they detracted from me” (ver. 3). There are six
different acts of this class, which may, when mentioned, very easily be borne in mind; (1)
to return good for evil, (2) not to return evil for evil; (3) to return good for good, (4) to return
evil for evil; (5) not to return good for good, (6) to return evil for good. The two first of these
belong to the good, and the first of these two is the better; the two last belong to the wicked,
and the latter of the two is the worse; the two middle to a sort of middle class of persons,
but the first of these borders upon the good, the latter on the bad. We should remark these
things in the holy Scriptures. Our Lord Himself returneth good for evil, who “justifieth the
ungodly;”4922 and who, when hanging upon the Cross, said, “Father, forgive them; for they
know not what they do.”4923…
5. But after he had said, “in place of loving me, they detracted from me;” what doth he
add? “But I gave myself unto prayer.” He said not indeed what he prayed, but what can we
better understand than for them themselves? For they were detracting greatly from Him
whom they crucified, when they ridiculed Him as if He were a man, whom in their opinion
they had conquered; from which Cross He said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not
what they do;” so that while they in the depth of their malignity were rendering evil for
good, He in the height of His goodness was rendering good for evil.…The divine words
then teach us by our Lord’s example, that when we feel others ungrateful to us, not only in
that they do not repay us with good, but even return evil for good, we should pray; He indeed
for others who were raging against Him, or in sorrow, or endangered in faith; but we for
ourselves in the first place, that we may by the mercy and aid of God conquer our own mind,
by which we are borne on to the desire of revenge, when any detraction is made from us,
either in our presence or our absence.…
6. He addeth, “Thus have they rewarded me evil for good” (ver. 4). And as if we asked,
what evil? for what good? “And hatred,” he saith, “for my good will.” This is the sum total
of their great guilt. For how could the persecutors injure Him who died of His own free-
will, and not by compulsion? But this very hatred is the greatest crime of the persecutor,

although it be the willing atonement of the sufferer. And he hath sufficiently explained the
sense of the above words, “In place of loving me,” since they owed love not as a general duty
only, but in return for His love: in that he hath here added, “for my good will.” This love
He mentioneth in the Gospel, when He saith, “How often would I have gathered thy children
together, and thou wouldest not!”4924
7. He then beginneth to prophesy what they should receive for this very impiety; detailing
their lot in such a manner, as if he wished its realization from a desire of revenge. Some not
understanding this mode of predicting the future, under the appearance of wishing evil,
suppose hatred to be returned for hatred, and an evil will for an evil will, since in truth it
belongeth to few to distinguish, in what way the punishment of the wicked pleaseth the ac-
cuser, who longeth to satiate his enmity; and in how widely different a way it pleaseth the
judge, who with a righteous mind punisheth sins. For the former returneth evil for evil: but
the judge when he punisheth doth not return evil for evil, since he returneth justice to the
unjust; and what is just, is surely good. He therefore punisheth not from delight in another’s
misery, which is evil for evil: but from love of justice, which is good for evil.…
8. “Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him; and let Satan stand at his right hand”
(ver. 5). Though the complaint had been before concerning many, the Psalm is now speaking
of one.…Since therefore he is here speaking of the traitor Judas, who, according to the
Scripture in the Acts of the Apostles, was to be punished with the penalty due to him,4925
what meaneth, “set thou an ungodly man over him,” save him whom in the next verse he
mentioneth by name, when he saith, “and let Satan stand at his right hand”? He therefore
who refused to be subject unto Christ, deserved this, that he should have the devil set over
him, that is, that he should be subject unto the devil.…For this reason also it is said of those
who, preferring the pleasures of this world to God, styled the people blessed who have such
and such things, “their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.”4926…
9. “When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned, and let his prayer be
turned into sin” (ver. 6). For prayer is not righteous except through Christ, whom he sold
in his atrocious sin: but the prayer which is not made through Christ, not only cannot blot
out sin, but is itself turned into sin. But it may be inquired on what occasion Judas could
have so prayed, that his prayer was turned into sin. I suppose that before he betrayed the
Lord, while he was thinking of betraying Him; for he could no longer pray through Christ.
For after he betrayed Him, and repented of it, if he prayed through Christ, he would ask for
pardon; if he asked for pardon, he would have hope; if he had hope, he would hope for
mercy; if he hoped for mercy, he would not have hanged himself in despair.…

Psalm CIX
10. “Let his days be few” (ver. 7). By “his days,” he meant the days of his apostleship,
which were few; since before the Passion of our Lord, they were ended by his crime and
death. And as if it were asked, What then shall become of that most sacred number twelve,
within which our Lord willed, not without a meaning, to limit His twelve first Apostles? he
at once addeth, “and let another take his office.” As much as to say, let both himself be
punished according to his desert, and let his number be filled up.
11. “Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow” (ver. 8). After his death, both
his children were fatherless, and his wife a widow. “Let his children be vagabonds, and be
carried away, and beg their bread” (ver. 9). By “vagabonds” he meaneth, uncertain whither
to go, destitute of all help. “Let them be driven from their habitations.” He here explaineth
what he had said above, “Let them be carried away.” How all this happened to his wife and
children, the following verses explain.
12. “Let the extortioner search out all his substance, and let the strangers spoil his labour”
(ver. 10). “Let there be no man to help him” (ver. 11): that is, to guard his posterity; wherefore
followeth, “nor to have compassion on his fatherless children”
13. But as even orphans may, without one to help them, and without a guardian, never-
theless increase amid trouble and want, and preserve their race by descent; he next saith,
“Let his posterity be destroyed; and in the next generation let his name be clean put out”
(ver. 12): that is, let what hath been generated by him generate no more, and quickly pass
away.
14. But what is it that he next addeth? “Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in re-
membrance in the sight of the Lord, and let not the sin of his mother be done away” (ver.
13). Is it to be understood, that even the sins of his fathers shall be visited upon him? For
upon him they are not visited, who hath been changed in Christ, and hath ceased to be the
child of the wicked, by not having imitated their conduct. 4927…And to these words, “I will
visit the sins of the fathers upon the children,”4928 is added, “who hate Me;” that is, hate Me
as their fathers hated Me: so that as the effect of imitating the good is that even their own
sins are blotted out, so the imitation of the wicked causeth men to suffer not their own de-
servings only, but those also of those whom they have imitated.…
15. “Let them alway be against4929 the Lord” (ver. 14). “Against the Lord,” meaneth in
the Lord’s sight: for other translators have rendered this line, “let them be always in the sight
of the Lord;” while others have rendered it, “let them be before the Lord alway;” as it is
elsewhere said, “Thou hast set our misdeeds in Thy sight.”4930 By “alway,” he meaneth that

this great crime should be without pardon, both here, and in a future life. “Let the memorial
of them perish from off the earth:” that is, of his father and of his mother. By memorial of
them, he meaneth, that which is preserved by successive generations: this he prophesied
should perish from the earth, because both Judas himself, and his sons, who were the me-
morial of his father and mother, without any succeeding offspring, as it is said above, were
consumed in the short space of one generation.4931…
16. “And that, because he remembered not to act mercifully” (ver. 15); either Judas, or
the people itself. But “remembered not” is better understood of the people: for if they slew
Christ, they might well remember the deed in penitence, and act mercifully towards His
members, whom they most perseveringly persecuted. For this reason he saith, “but persecuted
the poor man and the beggar” (ver. 16). It may indeed be understood of Judas; for the Lord
did not disdain to become poor, when He was rich, that we might be enriched by His
poverty.4932 But how shall I understand the word “beggar,” save perhaps because He said
to the Samaritan woman, “Give me to drink,”4933 and on the Cross He said, “I thirst.”4934
But as to what followeth, I do not see how it can be understood of our Head Himself, that
is, the Saviour of His own body, whom Judas persecuted. For after saying, “He persecuted
the poor man and the beggar:” he addeth, “and to slay,” that is, “that he might slay Him,”
for some have so rendered it, “Him that was pricked at the heart.” This expression is not
commonly used except of the stings of past sins in the sorrows of penitence; as it is said of
those who, when they had heard the Apostles after our Lord’s ascension, were “pricked in
heart,” even they who had slain the Lord.…
17. The Psalm then continueth: “His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen to him”
(ver. 17). Although Judas loved cursing, both in stealing from the money bag, and selling
and betraying the Lord: nevertheless, that people more openly loved cursing, when they
said, “His blood be on us, and on our children.”4935 “He loved not blessing, therefore it shall
be far from him.” Such was Judas indeed, since he loved not Christ, in whom is everlasting
blessing; but the Jewish people still more decidedly refused blessing, unto whom he who
had been enlightened by the Lord said, “Will ye also be His disciples?”4936 “He clothed
4931 [Here he inquires whether Judas, in Hades, could know the condition of his family; and he replies, “It
is indeed a great question, and not one to be discussed at present, because it belongeth to a labour of greater
extent, whether, or to what degree, or in what manner, the spirits of the dead are aware of what is passing around
us.” He compares Luke xvi. 23, 28.—C.]

himself with cursing, like as with a raiment:” either Judas, or that people. “And it came into
his bowels like water.”4937 Both without, then, and within; without, like a garment; within,
like water: since he hath come before the judgment-seat of Him “who hath power to destroy
both body and soul in hell;”4938 the body without, the soul within. “And like oil into his
bones.” He showeth that he worketh evil with delight, and storeth up cursing for himself,
that is, everlasting punishment; for blessing is eternal life. For at present evil deeds are his
delight, flowing like water into his bowels, like oil into his bones; but it is styled cursing,
because God hath appointed torments for such men.
18. “Let it be unto him as the cloak which covereth him” (ver. 18). Since he hath before
spoken of the cloak, why doth he repeat it? When he said, “He clothed himself with cursing
as with a raiment;” doth the raiment with which he is “covered” differ from that with which
he is “clothed”? For every man is clothed with his tunic, covered with his cloak; and what
is this, save boasting in iniquity, even in the sight of men? “and as the girdle,” he saith, “that
he is alway girded withal.” Men are girded chiefly that they may be better fit for toil, that
they may not be hindered by the folds of their dress. He therefore girdeth himself with
curses, who designeth an evil which he hath carefully contrived, not on a sudden impulse,
and who learneth in such a manner to do evil, that he is always ready to commit it.
19. “This is the work of them that slander me before the Lord” (ver. 19). He said not,
“their reward,” but, “their work:” for it is clear that by the clothing, covering, water, oil, and
girdle, he was describing the very works by which eternal curses are procured. It is not then
one Judas, but many, of whom it is said, “This is the work of them that slander me before
the Lord.” Although indeed the plural number might have been put for the singular; even
as, when Herod died, it was said by the Angel, “They are dead which sought the young
Child’s life.”4939 But who slander Christ more before the Lord, than they who slander the
very words of the Lord, by declaring that it is not He whom the Law of the Lord and His
Prophets announced beforehand? “And of those that speak evil against my soul:” by denying
that He, when He had willed, could have arisen: though He saith, “I have power to lay down
My life, and I have power to take it again.”4940
20. “But work Thou with me, O Lord God” (ver. 20). Some have thought “mercifully”
should be understood, some have actually added it; but the best copies have the words thus:
“But work Thou with me, O Lord God, for Thy Name’s sake.” Whence a higher sense should
not be passed over, supposing the Son to have thus addressed the Father, “Deal Thou with
4937 [It seems to me there is here a reference to the water of jealousy, Numb. v. 22, 23. Compare Acts i. 18.

Me,” since the works of the Father and of the Son are the same. Where although we under-
stand mercy,—for these words follow, “for sweet is Thy mercy,”—because he said not, “In
me,” or, “over me;” or anything of this sort: but, “work Thou with Me;” we rightly understand
that the Father and Son together work mercifully towards the vessels of mercy.4941 “Work
with me,”4942 may also be understood to mean, help me. We use this expression in our daily
language, when we are speaking of anything which is in our favour; “It works with us.” For
the Father aideth the Son, as far as the Deity aideth Man, on account of His having assumed
the “form of a servant,” to which Man, God, and to which “Form of a servant,” the Lord too
is Father. For in the “form of God,” the Son needeth not aid, for He is equally all-powerful
with the Father, on which account He also is the helper of men.…And because when he had
said, “Work Thou with me,” he added, “for Thy Name’s sake,” he hath commended grace.
For without previous deserving works, human nature was raised to such a height, that the
whole in one, the Word and Flesh, that is, God and Man, was styled the Only-begotten Son
of God. And this was done that that which had been lost might be sought by Him who had
created it, through that which had not been lost; whence the following words, “For Thy
mercy is sweet.”
21. “O deliver me, for I am needy and poor” (ver. 21). Need and poverty is that weakness,
through which He was crucified.4943 “And my heart is disturbed within me.” This alludeth
to those words which He spoke when His Passion was drawing near, “My soul is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto death.”4944
22. “I go hence like a shadow that declineth” (ver. 22). By this he signified death itself.
For as night comes of the shadow’s declining, so death comes of mortal flesh. “And am
driven away as the locusts.” This I think would be more suitably understood of His members,
that is, of His faithful disciples. That he might make it much plainer, he preferred writing
“locusts” in the plural number: although many may be understood where the singular
number is used, as in that passage, “He spake, and the locust came;” 4945 but it would have
been more obscure. His disciples, then, were driven away, that is, were put to flight by per-
secutors, either the multitude of whom He wished to be signified by the word locusts, or
their passing from one place to another.
23. “My knees are weak through fasting” (ver. 23). We read, that our Lord Christ under-
went a fast of forty days:4946 but had fasting so great power over Him, that His knees were

weakened? Or is this more suitably understood of His members, that is, of His saints? “And
my flesh is changed because of the oil;”4947 because of spiritual grace. Whence Christ was
so called from the Greek word, chrisma, which signifies unction. But the flesh was changed
through the oil, not for the worse, but for the better, that is, rising from the dishonour of
death to the glory of immortality.…His flesh was not yet changed. But whether the Holy
Spirit be represented by water through the notion of ablution or irrigation, or by oil through
that of exultation and the inflaming of charity; It doth not differ from Itself, because Its
types are different. For there is a great difference between the lion and the lamb, and yet
Christ is represented by both.…
24. “I became also a reproach unto them” (ver. 24): through the death of the Cross. “For
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.”4948 “They
looked upon Me, and shaked their heads.” Because they beheld His crucifixion, without
beholding His resurrection: they saw when His knees were weakened, they saw not when
His flesh was changed.
25. “Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to Thy mercy” (ver. 25). This may
be referred to the whole, both to the Head and to the body: to the Head, owing to His having
taken the form of a servant; to the body, on account of the servants themselves. For He
might even in them have said unto God, “Help Me:” and, “O save Me:” as in them He said
unto Paul, “Why persecutest thou Me”? 4949 The following words, “according to Thy mercy,”
describe grace given gratuitously, not according to the merit of works.
26. “And let them know how that this is Thy Hand, and that Thou, Lord, hast made it”
(ver. 26). He said, “Let them know,” of those for whom He even prayed while they were ra-
ging; for even those who afterwards believed in Him were among the crowd who shook
their heads in mockery of Him. But let those who ascribe unto God the shape of the human
body, learn in what sense God hath a hand. Let us therefore understand, that the Hand of
God meaneth Christ: whence it is elsewhere said, “Unto whom is the arm of the Lord re-
vealed?”4950…
27. “Though they curse, yet bless Thou” (ver. 27). Vain therefore and false is the cursing
of the sons of men, that have pleasure in vanity, and seek a lie;4951 but when God blesseth,
He doth what He saith. “Let them be confounded that rise up against me.” For their imagining
that they have some power against Me, is the reason that they rise up against Me; but when

over the whole earth, they shall be confounded. “But Thy servant shall rejoice:” either on
the right hand of the Father, or in His members when they rejoice, both in hope among
temptations, and after temptations for evermore.
28. “Let my slanderers be clothed with shame” (ver. 28): that is, let it shame them to
have slandered me. But this may also be understood as a blessing, in that they are amended.
“And let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a double cloak;” for diplois
is a double cloak; that is, let them be confounded both within and without: both before God
and before men.
29. “As for me, I will confess greatly4952 unto the Lord with my mouth” (ver. 29).…Is
He said to “praise among the multitude” because He is with His Church here even unto the
end of the world;4953 so that we may understand by “among the multitude,” that He is
honoured by this very multitude? For he is said to be in the midst, unto whom the chief
honour is paid. But if the heart is, as it were, that which is mid-most of a man, no better
construction can be put on this passage than this, I will praise Him in the hearts of many.
For Christ dwelleth through faith in our hearts;4954 and therefore he saith, “with my mouth,”
that is, with the mouth of my body, which is the Church.
30. “For He stood at the right hand of the poor” (ver. 30). It was said of Judas, “Let Satan
stand at his right hand;” since he chose to increase his riches by selling Christ; but here the
Lord stood at the right hand of the poor, that the Lord Himself might be the poor man’s
riches. “He stood at the right hand of the poor,” not to multiply the years of a life that one
day must end, nor to increase his stores, nor to render him strong in the strength of the
body, or secure for a time; “but,” he saith, “to save my soul from the persecutors.” Now the
soul is rendered safe from the persecutors, if we do not consent to them unto evil; but there
is no such consent to them when the Lord standeth at the right hand of the poor, that he
may not give way through his very poverty, that is, weakness. This aid was given to the Body
of Christ in the case of all the holy Martyrs.
4952 [He says: “The word nimis is used in Latin to express excess, the contrary to parum, which meaneth
deficiency. The Greek word for nimis is ˆγαν: but this verse hath σφόδρα, not ˆγαν; which our translators have
sometimes rendered by nimis, sometimes by valdè (‘very much’). Now if nimis be taken as equivalent to valdè,
it may be understood of praise: for this confession signifieth praise. For the next words are, ‘and I will praise
Him among the multitude.’”—C.]

Psalm CIX
Psalm CX.4955
1. …This Psalm is one of those promises, surely and openly prophesying our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ; so that we are utterly unable to doubt that Christ is announced in this
Psalm, since we are now Christians, and believe the Gospel. For when our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ asked of the Jews, whose Son they alleged Christ to be, and they had replied,
“the Son of David;” He at once replied to their answer, “How then doth David in spirit call
Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto My Lord?” etc. “If then,” He asked, “David in the
spirit call Him Lord, how is He his son?”4956 With this verse this Psalm beginneth.
2. “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies
Thy footstool” (ver. 1). We ought, therefore, thoroughly to consider this question proposed
to the Jews by the Lord, in the very commencement of the Psalm. For if what the .Jews
answered be asked of us, whether we confess or deny it; God forbid that we should deny it.
If it be said to us, Is Christ the Son of David, or not? if we reply, No, we contradict the
Gospel for the Gospel of St. Matthew thus beginneth, “The book of the generation of Jesus
Christ, the Son of David.”4957 The Evangelist declareth, that he is writing the book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David. The Jews, then, when questioned by Christ,
whose Son they believed Christ to be, rightly answered, the Son of David. The Gospel agreeth
with their answer. Not only the suspicion of the Jews, but the faith of Christians, doth declare
this.…“If then David in the spirit called Him Lord, how is He his son?” The Jews were silent
at this question: they found no further reply: yet they did not seek Him as the Lord, for they
did not acknowledge Him to be Himself that Son of David. But let us, brethren, both believe
and declare: for, “with the heart we believe unto righteousness: but with the mouth confession
is made unto salvation;”4958 let us believe, I say, and let us declare both the Son of David,
and the Lord of David. Let us not be ashamed of the Son of David, lest we find the Lord of
David angry with us.
3. …We know that Christ sitteth at the right hand of the Father, since His resurrection
from the dead, and ascent into heaven. It is already done: we saw not it, but we have believed
it: we have read it in the Scripture, have heard it preached, and hold it by faith. So that by
the very circumstance that Christ was David’s Son, He became His Lord also. For That which
was born of the seed of David was so honoured, that It was also the Lord of David. Thou
wonderest at this, as if the same did not happen in human affairs. For if it should happen,
that the son of any private person be made a king, will he not be his father’s lord? What is
yet more wonderful may happen, not only that the son of a private person, by being made

a king, may become his father’s lord; but that the son of a layman, by being made a Bishop,
may become his father’s father. So that in this very circumstance, that Christ took upon
Him the flesh, that He died in the flesh, that He rose again in the same flesh, that in the same
He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of His Father, in this same flesh so
honoured, so brightened, so changed into a heavenly garb, He is both David’s Son, and
David’s Lord.…
4. Christ, therefore, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Son is on the right hand of the
Father, hidden from us. Let us believe. Two things are here said: that God said, “Sit Thou
on My right hand;” and added, “until I make Thy enemies Thy footstool;” that is, beneath
Thy feet. Thou dost not see Christ sitting at the right hand of the Father: yet thou canst see
this, how His enemies are made His footstool. While the latter is fulfilled openly, believe
the former to be fulfilled secretly. What enemies are made His footstool? Those to whom
imagining vain things it is said, “Why do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why
do the people imagine a vain thing?” etc.4959…He therefore sitteth at the right hand of God,
till His enemies be placed beneath His feet. This is going on, this is taking place: although
it is accomplished by degrees, it is going on without end. For though the heathen rage, will
they, taking counsel together against Christ, prevent the fulfilment of these words: “I will
give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy posses-
sion”?…“Their memorial is perished with a cry;” but, “The Lord shall endure for ever:”4960
as another Psalm, but not another Spirit, saith.
5. And what followeth? “The Lord shall send the rod of Thy power out of Sion” (ver.
2). It appeareth, brethren, it most clearly appeareth, that the Prophet is not speaking of that
kingdom of Christ, in which He reigneth for ever with His Father, Ruler of the things which
are made through Him: for when doth not God the Word reign, who is in the beginning
with God?4961 For it is said, “Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
God, be honour and glory for ever and ever.”4962 To what eternal King? To one invisible,
incorruptible. For in this, that Christ is with the Father, invisible and incorruptible, because
He is His Word, and His Power, and His Wisdom, and God with God, through whom all
things were made; He is “King eternal;” but, nevertheless, that reign of temporal government,
by which, through the mediation of His flesh, He called us into eternity, beginneth with
Christians; but of His reign there shall be no end. His enemies therefore are made His
footstool, while He is sitting on the right hand of His Father, as it is written; this is now going
on, this will go on unto the end.…

Psalm CX
6. When therefore He hath sent the rod of His power out of Sion: what shall happen?
“Be Thou ruler, even in the midst among Thine enemies.” First, “Be Thou ruler in the midst
of Thine enemies:” in the midst of the raging heathen. For shall He rule “in the midst of His
enemies” at a later season, when the Saints have received their reward, and the ungodly their
condemnation? And what wonder if He shall then rule, when the righteous reign with Him
for ever, and the ungodly burn with eternal punishments? What wonder, if He shall then?
Now “in the midst of Thine enemies,” now in this transition of ages, in this propagation
and succession of human mortality, now while the torrent of time is gliding by, unto this is
the rod of Thy power sent out of Sion, “that Thou mayest be Ruler in the midst of Thine
enemies.” Rule Thou, rule among Pagans, Jews, heretics, false brethren. Rule Thou, rule, O
Son of David, Lord of David, rule in the midst of Pagans, Jews, heretics, false brethren. “Be
Thou Ruler in the midst of Thine enemies.” We understand not this verse aright, if we do
not see that it is already going on.…
7. “With Thee the beginning on the day of Thy power” (ver. 3). What is this day of His
power, when is there beginning with Him, or what beginning, or in what sense is there be-
ginning with Him, since He is the Beginning?…
8. What meaneth, “With Thee is the beginning”? Suppose anything you please as the
beginning. Of Christ Himself, it would rather have been said, Thou art the Beginning, than,
With Thee is the beginning. For He answered to those who asked Him, “Who art Thou?”
and said, “Even the same that I said unto you, the Beginning;”4963 since His Father also is
the Beginning, of whom is the only-begotten Son, in which Beginning was the Word, for
the Word was with God. What then, if both the Father and the Son are the beginning, are
there two beginnings? God forbid! For as the Father is God, and the Son is God, but the
Father and the Son are not two Gods, but one God: so is the Father Beginning and the Son
Beginning, but the Father and the Son are not two, but one Beginning. “With Thee is the
beginning.” Then it shall appear in what sense the beginning is with Thee. Not that the be-
ginning is not with Thee here also. For hast Thou not also said, “Behold, ye shall be scattered,
every man to his own, and shall leave Me alone; but I am not alone, because the Father is
with Me”?4964 Here therefore also, the beginning is with Thee. For Thou hast said elsewhere
also, “But the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth His works.”4965 “With Thee is the begin-
ning:” nor was the Father ever separated from Thee. But when the Beginning shall appear
to be with Thee, then shall it be manifest unto all who are made like Thee; since they shall
see Thee as Thou art;4966 for Philip saw Thee here, and sought the Father.4967 Then therefore

shall be seen what now is believed: then shall “the beginning be with Thee” in the sight of
the righteous, in the sight of saints; the ungodly being removed, that they may not see the
brightness of the Lord.…
9. Explain of what power thou speakest. Because here also, as is said, His power is
mentioned, when the rod of His power is sent forth out of Sion, that He may be Ruler in
the midst of His enemies. Of what power speakest thou, “In the splendour of the saints”?
“In the splendour,” he saith, “of the saints.” He speaketh of that power when the saints shall
be in splendour; not when still carrying about their earthly flesh, and groaning in a mortal
and corruptible body.…
10. But this is put off, this will be granted afterwards: what is there now? “From the
womb I have begotten Thee, before the morning star.” What is here? If God hath a Son,
hath He also a womb? Like fleshly bodies, He hath not; for He hath not a bosom either; yet
it is said, “He who is in the bosom of the Father, hath declared Him.”4968 But that which is
the womb, is the bosom also: both bosom and womb are put for a secret place. What meaneth,
“from the womb”? From what is secret, from what is hidden; from Myself, from My substance;
this is the meaning of “from the womb;” for, “Who shall declare His generation?”4969 Let
us then understand the Father saying unto the Son, “From My womb before the morning
star have I brought Thee forth.” What then meaneth, “before the morning star”? The
morning star is put for the stars, as if the Scripture signified the whole from a part, and from
one conspicuous star all the stars. But how were those stars created? “That they may be for
signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.”4970…This expression also, “before the
morning star,” is used both figuratively and literally, and was thus fulfilled. For the Lord
was born at night from the womb of the Virgin Mary; the testimony of the shepherds doth
assert this, who were “keeping watch over their flock.”4971 So David: O Thou, my Lord, who
sittest at the right hand of my Lord, whence art Thou my Son, except because, “From the
womb before the morning star I have begotten Thee”?
11. And unto what art Thou born? “The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou
art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedec” (ver. 4). For unto this wast Thou born
from the womb before the morning star, that Thou mightest be a Priest for ever after the
order of Melchizedec. For in that character in which He was born of the Father, God with
God, coeternal with Him who begot Him, He is not a Priest; but He is a Priest on account
of the flesh which He assumed, on account of the victim which He was to offer for us received
from us. “The Lord,” then, “hath sworn.” What then meaneth, the Lord hath sworn? Doth

Psalm CX
the Lord, who forbiddeth men to swear,4972 Himself swear? Or doth He possibly forbid
man to swear chiefly on this account, that he may not fall into perjury, and for this reason
the Lord may swear, since He cannot be forsworn. For man, who, through a habit of
swearing, may slip into perjury, is rightly forbidden to swear: for he will be farther from
perjury in proportion as he is far from swearing. For the man who sweareth, may swear
truly or falsely: but he who sweareth not, cannot swear falsely; for he sweareth not at all.
Why then should not the Lord swear, since the Lord’s oath is the seal of the promise? Let
Him swear by all means. What then dost thou, when thou swearest? Thou callest God to
witness: this is to swear, to call God to witness; and for this reason there must be anxiety,
that thou mayest not call God to witness anything false. If therefore thou by an oath dost
call God to witness, why then should not God also call Himself to witness with an oath? “I
live, saith the Lord,” this is the Lord’s oath.…“The Lord sware,” then, that is, confirmed:
“He will not repent,” He will not change. What? “Thou art a Priest for ever. “For ever,” for
He will not repent. But Priest, in what sense? Will there be those victims, victims offered by
the Patriarchs, altars of blood, and tabernacle, and those sacred emblems of the Old Coven-
ant? God forbid! These things are already abolished; the temple being destroyed, that
priesthood taken away, their victim and their sacrifice having alike disappeared, not even
the Jews have these things. They see that the priesthood after the order of Aaron hath already
perished, and they do not recognise the Priesthood after the order of Melchizedec. I speak
unto believers. If catechumens understand not something, let them lay aside sloth, and
hasten unto knowledge. It is not therefore needful for me to disclose mysteries here: 4973
let the Scriptures intimate to you what is the Priesthood after the order of Melchizedec.
12. “The Lord on Thy right hand” (ver. 5). The Lord had said, “Sit Thou on My right
hand;” now the Lord is on His right hand, as if they changed seats.…That very Christ, the
“Lord on Thy right hand,” unto whom Thou hast sworn, and it will not repent Thee: what
doth He, Priest for evermore? What doth He, who is at the right hand of God, and interce-
deth for us,4974 like a priest entering into the inner places, and into the holy of holies, into
the mysteries of heaven, He alone being without sin, and therefore easily purifying from
sins.4975 He therefore “on Thy right hand shall wound even kings in the day of His wrath.”
What kings, dost thou ask? Hast thou forgotten? “The kings of the earth stood up, and the
4972 Matt. v. 34.
4973 [He says elsewhere on Ps. civ. ver. 3: “What is that which is hidden, and is not public in the Church?
The Sacrament of Baptism, the Sacrament of the Eucharist. For our good works even Pagans see, but Sacraments
are hidden from them.” Note the implications: two Sacraments, and no public celebration of the Eucharist. See

Psalm CX
rulers took counsel together against the Lord, and against His Anointed.”4976 These kings
He wounded by His glory, and by the weight of His Name made kings weak, so that they
had not power to effect what they wished. For they strove amain to blot out the Christian
name from the earth, and could not; for “Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be
broken.”4977 Kings therefore fall on this “stone of offence,” and are therefore wounded,
when they say, Who is Christ? I know not what Jew or what Galilean He may have been,
who died, who was slain in such a manner! The stone is before thy feet, lying, so to speak,
mean and humble: therefore by scorning thou dost stumble, by stumbling thou fallest, by
falling thou art wounded.…“But on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.”4978
When therefore any one falleth upon it, it lieth as it were low; it then woundeth: but when
it shall grind him to powder, then it will come from above. See how in these two words, it
shall wound him and grind him to powder: he striketh upon it, and it shall come down upon
him: are distinguished the two seasons, of the humiliation and the majesty of Christ, of
hidden punishment and future judgment. He will not crush, when He cometh, that man
whom He doth not wound when He lieth in a contemptible appearance.…
13. “He shall judge among the heathen: He shall fill up what hath fallen” (ver. 6).
Whoever thou art who art obstinate against Christ, thou hast raised on high a tower that
must fall. It is good that thou shouldest cast thyself down, become humble, throw thyself at
the feet of Him who sitteth on the right hand of the Father, that in thee a ruin may be made
to be built up. For if thou abidest in thy evil height, thou shalt be cast down when thou canst
not be built up. For of such the Scripture saith in another passage: “Therefore shall He break
down, and not build them up.”4979 Beyond doubt he would not say this of some, unless
there were some whom He broke down so as to build them up again. And this is going on
at this time, while Christ is judging among the heathen in such a manner as to fill up what
hath fallen. “He shall smite many heads over the earth.” Here upon the earth in this life He
shall smite many heads. He maketh them humble instead of proud; and I dare to say, my
brethren, that it is more profitable to walk here humbly with the head wounded, than with
the head erect to fall into the judgment of eternal death. He will smite many heads when he
causeth them to fall, but He will fill them up and build them up again.
14. “He shall drink of the brook4980 in the way, therefore shall he lift up his head” (ver.
7). Let us consider Him drinking of the brook in the way: first of all, what is the brook? the
onward flow of human mortality: for as a brook is gathered together by the rain, overflows,

4977 Matt. xxi. 44.
4978 Luke xx. 18.
4979 Ps. xxviii. 5.

Psalm CX
roars, runs, and by running runs down, that is, finishes its course; so is all this course of
mortality. Men are born, they live, they die, and when some die others are born, and when
they die others are born, they succeed, they flock together, they depart and will not remain.
What is held fast here? what doth not run? what is not on its way to the abyss as if it was
gathered together from rain? For as a river suddenly drawn together from rain from the
drops of showers runneth into the sea, and is seen no more, nor was it seen before it was
collected from the rain; so this hidden rain is collected together from hidden sources, and
floweth on; at death again it travelleth where it is hidden: this intermediate state soundeth
and passeth away. Of this brook He drinketh, He hath not disdained to drink of this brook;
for to drink of this brook was to Him to be born and to die. What this brook hath, is birth
and death; Christ assumed this, He was born, He died. “Therefore hath He lifted up His
head;” that is, because He was humble, and “became obedient unto death, even the death
of the Cross: therefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is
above every name; that at the Name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in Heaven, and
things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue shall confess that Jesus
Christ the Lord is in the glory of God the Father.”4981

Psalm CX
Psalm CXI.4982
1. The days have come for us to sing Allelujah.4983…Now these days come only to pass
away, and pass away to come, again, and typify the day which does not come and pass away,
because it is neither preceded by yesterday to cause it to come, nor pressed upon by the
morrow to cause it to pass.…For as these days succeed in regular season, with a joyful
cheerfulness, the past days of Lent, whereby the misery of this life before the Resurrection
of the Lord’s body is signified; so that day which after the Resurrection shall be given to the
full body of the Lord, that is, to the holy Church, when all the troubles and sorrows of this
life have been shut out, shall succeed with perpetual bliss. But this life demandeth from us
self-restraint, that although groaning and weighed down with our toil and struggles, and
desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven,4984 we may refrain from
secular pleasures: and this is signified by the number of forty, which was the period of the
fasts of Moses, and Elias,4985 and our Lord Himself.…But by the number fifty after our
Lord’s resurrection, during which season we sing Allelujah, not the term and passing away
of a certain season is signified, but that blessed eternity; because the denary4986 added to
forty signifieth the reward paid to the faithful who toil in this life, which our Father hath
prepared an equal share of for the first and for the last. Let us therefore hear the heart of the
people of God full of divine praises. He representeth in this Psalm some one exulting in
happy joyfulness, he prefigureth the people whose hearts are overflowing with the love of
God, that is, the body of Christ, freed from all evil.
2. “I will make confession unto Thee, O Lord,” he saith, “with my whole heart” (ver. 1).
Confession is not always confession of sins, but the praise of God is poured forth in the de-
votion of confession. The former mourneth, the latter rejoiceth: the former showeth the
wound to the physician, the latter giveth thanks for health. The latter confession signifieth
some one, not merely freed from every evil, but even separate from all the ill-disposed. And
for this reason let us consider the place where he confesseth unto the Lord with all his heart.
“In the counsel,” he saith, “of the upright, and in the congregation:” I suppose, of those who
shall “sit upon the twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”4987 For there will be
no longer an unjust man among them, the thefts of no Judas are allowed, no Simon Magus
is baptized, wishing to buy the Spirit, whilst he designeth to sell it;4988 no coppersmith like

Alexander doth many evil deeds,4989 no man covered with sheep’s clothing creepeth in with
feigned fraternity; such as those among whom the Church must now groan, and such as she
must then shut out, when all the righteous shall be gathered together.
“These are the great works of the Lord, sought out unto all His wills” (ver. 2): through
which mercy forsaketh none who confesseth, no man’s wickedness is unpunished.4990…Let
man choose for himself what he listeth: the works of the Lord are not so constituted, that
the creature, having free discretion allowed him, should transcend the will of the Creator,
even though he act contrary to His will. God willeth not that thou shouldest sin; for He
forbiddeth it: yet if thou hast sinned, imagine not that the man hath done what he willed,
and that hath happened to God which He willed not. For as He would that man would not
sin, so would He spare the sinner, that he may return and live; He so willeth finally to punish
him who persisteth in his sin, that the rebellious cannot escape the power of justice. Thus
whatever choice thou hast made, the Almighty will not be at a loss to fulfil His will concerning
thee.
3. “Confession and glorious deeds are His work” (ver. 3). What is a more glorious deed
than to justify the ungodly? But perhaps the work of man preventeth that glorious work of
God, so that when he hath confessed his sins, he deserveth to be justified.…This is the
glorious work of the Lord: for he loveth most, to whom most is forgiven.4991 This is the
glorious work of the Lord: for “where sin abounded, there did grace much more abound.”4992
But perhaps a man would deserve justification from works. “Not,” saith he, “of works, lest
any man boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.”4993
For a man worketh not righteousness save he be justified: but by “believing on Him that
justifieth the ungodly,”4994 he beginneth with faith; that good may not by preceding show
what he hath deserved, but by following what he hath received.…
4. “He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered” (ver. 4): by abasing this man,
exalting that. Reserving unusual miracles for a fit season, that thus human weakness, intent
upon novelty, may remember them, although His daily miracles be greater. He created so
many trees throughout the whole earth, and no one wondereth: He dried up one with a
word, and the hearts of mortals were thunderstruck.4995 For that miracle, which hath not

through its frequency become common, will cling most firmly to the heart. But of what use
were the miracles, save that He might be feared? What too would fear profit, unless “the
gracious and merciful Lord” gave “meat unto them that fear Him”? (ver. 5); meat that doth
not spoil, “bread that cometh down from heaven,”4996 which He gave to no deservings of
ours. For “Christ died for the ungodly.”4997 No one then would give such food, save a gracious
and merciful Lord. But if He gave so much to this life, if the sinner who was to be justified
received the Word made flesh; what shall he receive when glorified in a future world? For,
“He shall ever be mindful of His covenant.” Nor hath He who hath given a pledge, given
the whole.
5. “He shall show His people the power of His works” (ver. 6). Let not the holy Israelites,
who have left all their possessions and have followed Him, be saddened; let them not be
sorrowful and say, “Who then can be saved?” For “it is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.” For “with men these
things are impossible, but with God all things are possible.”4998 “That He may give them
the heritage of the heathen.” For they went to the heathen, and enjoined the rich of this
world “not to be high-minded, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,”4999
to whom that is easy which is difficult for men. For thus many were called, thus the heritage
of the heathen has been occupied, thus it hath happened, that even many who have not
abandoned all their possessions in this life in order to follow Him, have despised even life
itself for the sake of confessing His Name; and like camels humbling themselves to bear the
burden of troubles, have entered as it were through a needle’s eye, through the piercing
straits of suffering. He hath wrought these effects, unto whom all things are possible.
6. “The works of His hands are verity and judgment” (ver. 7). Let verity be held by those
who are judged here. Martyrs are here sentenced, and brought to the judgment-seat, that
they may judge not only those by whom they have been judged, but even give judgment on
angels,5000 against whom was their struggle here, even when they seemed to be judged by
men. Let not tribulation, distress, famine, nakedness, the sword, separate from Christ. For
“all His commandments are true;”5001 He deceiveth not, He giveth us what He promised.
Yet we should not expect here what He promised; we should not hope for it: but “they stand
fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and equity” (ver. 8). It is equitable and just that
we should labour here and repose there; since “He sent redemption unto His people” (ver.
4996 John vi. 27, 51.

Psalm CXI
9). But from what are they redeemed, save from the captivity of this pilgrimage? Let not
therefore rest be sought, save in the heavenly country. God indeed gave the carnal Israelites
an earthly Jerusalem, “which is in bondage with her children:” but this is the Old Covenant,
pertaining unto the old man. But they who there understood the figure, even then were
heirs of the New Covenant; for “Jerusalem which is above is free, which is our everlasting
mother in heaven.”5002 But that transitory promises were given in that Old Testament is
proved by the fact itself: however, “He hath commended His covenant for ever.” But what,
but the New? Whosoever dost wish to be heir of this, deceive not thyself, and think not of
a land flowing with milk and honey, nor of pleasant farms, nor of gardens abounding in
fruits and shade: desire not how to gain anything of this sort, such as the eye of covetousness
is wont to lust for. For since “covetousness is the root of all evils,”5003 it must be cut off,
that it may be consumed here; not be put off, that it may be satisfied there. First escape
punishments, avoid hell; before thou longest for a God who promiseth, beware of one who
threateneth. For “holy and reverend is His Name.”
7. …“The fear of the Lord,” therefore, “is the beginning of wisdom.” “Understanding
is good” (ver. 10). Who gainsayeth? But to understand, and not to do, is dangerous. It is
“good,” therefore, “to those that do thereafter.” Nor let it lift up the mind unto pride; for,
“the praise of Him,” the fear of whom is the beginning of wisdom, “endureth for ever:” and
this will be the reward, this the end, this the everlasting station and abode. There are found
the true commandments, made fast for ever and ever; here is the very heritage of the New
Covenant commanded for ever. “One thing,” he saith, “I have desired of the Lord, which I
will require: even that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.”5004 For,
“blessed are they that dwell in the house” of the Lord: “they will be alway praising”5005 Him;
for “His praise endureth for ever.”

Psalm CXII.5006
1. I believe, brethren, that ye remarked and committed to memory the title of this Psalm.
“The conversion,” he saith, “of Haggai and Zechariah.” These prophets were not as yet in
existence, when these verses were sung.5007…But both, the one within a year after the other,
began to prophesy that which seemeth to pertain to the restoration of the temple, as was
foretold so long before.5008…“For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.”5009
Whoever therefore converteth himself to the work of this building together, and to the hope
of a firm and holy edifice, like a living stone from the miserable ruin of this world, under-
standeth the title of the Psalm, understandeth “the conversion of Haggai and Zechariah.”
Let him therefore chant the following verses, not so much with the voice of his tongue as
of his life. For the completion of the building will be that ineffable peace of wisdom, the
“beginning” of which is the “fear of the Lord:” let him therefore, whom this conversion
buildeth together, begin thence.
2. “Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he will have great delight in His command-
ments” (ver. 1). God, who alone judgeth both truthfully and mercifully, will see how far he
obeyeth His commandments: since “the life of man on earth is a temptation,”5010 as holy
Job saith. But “He who judgeth us is the Lord.”5011…He therefore will see how far each man
profiteth in His commandments; yet he who loveth the peace of this building together, shall
have great delight in them; nor ought he to despair, since there is “peace on earth for men
of good will.”5012
3. Next follows, “His seed shall be mighty upon earth” (ver. 2). The Apostle witnesseth,
that the works of mercy are the seed of the future harvest, when he saith, “Let us not be
weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap;”5013 and again, “But this I say, He which
soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly.”5014 But what, brethren, is more mighty than
that not only Zacchæus should buy the kingdom of Heaven by the half of his goods,5015 but
even the widow for two mites,5016 and that each should possess an equal share there? What

house is his heart; where, with the praise of God, he liveth in greater riches with the hope
of eternal life, than with men flattering, in palaces of marble, with splendidly adorned ceilings,
with the fear of everlasting death. “For his righteousness endureth for ever:” this is his glory,
there are his riches. While the other’s purple, and fine linen, and grand banquets, even when
present, are passing away; and when they have come to an end, the burning tongue shall
cry out, longing for a drop of water from the finger’s end.5017
4. “Unto the right-hearted there ariseth up light in the darkness” (ver. 4). Justly do the
godly direct their heart unto their God, justly do they walk with their God, preferring His
will to themselves; and having no proud presumption in their own. For they remember that
they were some time in darkness, but are now light in the Lord.5018 “Merciful, pitying, and
just is the Lord God.” It delighteth us that He is “merciful and pitying,” but it perhaps terri-
fieth us that the Lord God is “just.” Fear not, despair not at all, happy man, who fearest the
Lord, and hast great delight in His commandments; be thou sweet, be merciful and lend.
For the Lord is just in this manner, that He judgeth without mercy him who hath not shown
mercy;5019 but, “Sweet is the man who is merciful and lendeth” (ver. 5): God will not spew
him out of His mouth as if he were not sweet. “Forgive,” He saith, “and ye shall be forgiven;
give, and it shall be given unto you.”5020 Whilst thou forgivest that thou mayest be forgiven,
thou art merciful; whilst thou givest that it may be given unto thee, thou lendest. For though
all be called generally mercy where another is assisted in his distress, yet there is a difference
where thou spendest neither money, nor the toil of bodily labour, but by forgiving what
each man hath sinned against thee, thou gainest free pardon for thine own sins also.…He
who is unwilling to give to the poor, seeketh riches; listen to what is written, “Thou shalt
have treasure in heaven.”5021 Thou wilt not then lose honour by forgiving: for it is a very
laudable triumph to conquer anger: wilt not grow poor by giving; for a heavenly treasure is
a more safe possession. The former verse, “Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house,”
was pregnant with this verse.
5. He therefore who doth these things, “shall guide his words with discretion.” His deeds
themselves are the words whereby he shall be defended at the Judgment; which shall not be
without mercy unto him, since he hath himself shown mercy. “For he shall never be moved”
(ver. 6): he who, called to the right hand, shall hear these words, “Come, ye blessed of My

Psalm CXII
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” For no
works of theirs, save works of mercy, are there mentioned. He therefore shall hear, “Come,
ye blessed of My Father;” for, “the generation of the right ones shall be blessed.” Thus, “the
righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.” “He will not be afraid of any evil hearing;
for his heart standeth fast and believeth in the Lord” (ver. 7). Such as the words which he
will hear addressed to those on the left hand, “Depart into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels.”5022 He therefore who seeketh here not his own things, but those of
Jesus Christ,5023 most patiently endureth sufferings, waiteth for the promises with faith.
Nor is he broken down by any temptations: “His heart is established, and will not shrink,
until he see beyond his enemies” (ver. 8). His enemies wished to see good things here, and
when invisible blessings were promised them, used to say, “Who will show us any good?”5024
Let our heart therefore be established, and shrink not, until we see beyond our enemies. For
they wish to see good things of men in the land of the dying; we trust to see the good things
of the Lord in the land of the living.5025
6. But it is a great thing to have the heart established, and not to be moved, while they
rejoice who love what they see, and mock at him who hopeth for what he seeth not; “what
the Lord hath prepared for them that love Him.”5026 How great is the value of this which
is not seen, and it is bought for so much as each man is able to give for it. On this account
he also “dispersed abroad, and gave to the poor” (ver. 9): he saw not, yet he kept buying;
but He was storing up the treasure in heaven, who deigned to hunger and thirst in the poor
on earth. It is no wonder then if “his righteousness remaineth for ever:” He who created the
ages being his guardian. “His horn,” whose humility was scorned by the proud, “shall be
exalted with honour.”
7. “The ungodly shall see it, and he shall be angered” (ver. 10): this is that late and
fruitless repentance. For with whom rather than himself is he “angered,” when he shall say,
“Our pride, what hath it profited us? the boastfulness of our riches, what hath it given
us?5027” seeing the horn of him exalted with honour, who “dispersed abroad, and gave to
the poor.” “He shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away:” for “there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.” For he will no more bring forth leaves and bloom, as would happen
if he had repented in season: but he will then repent, when “the desire of the ungodly shall
perish,” no consolation succeeding. “The desire of the ungodly shall perish,” when “all things

Psalm CXII
Psalm CXIII.5030
1. …When ye hear sung in the Psalms, “Praise the Lord, ye children” (ver. 1); imagine
not that that exhortation pertaineth not unto you, because having already passed the youth
of the body, ye are either blooming in the prime of manhood, or growing gray with the
honours of old age: for unto all of you the Apostle saith, “Brethren, be not children in un-
derstanding; howbeit, in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.”5031 What
malice in particular, save pride? For it is pride that, presuming in false greatness, suffereth
not man to walk along the narrow path, and to enter by the narrow gate; but the child easily
entereth through the narrow entrance; and thus no man, save as a child, entereth into the
kingdom of heaven. “Praise the Name of the Lord.”…Let Him therefore be alway proclaimed:
“Blessed be the Name of the Lord, from this time forth for evermore” (ver. 2). Let Him be
proclaimed everywhere: “From the rising up of the sun unto the going down of the same,
praise ye the Name of the Lord” (ver. 3).
2. If any of the holy children who praise the Name of the Lord were to ask of me and
say to me, “for evermore” I understand to mean unto all eternity: but why “from this,” and
why is not the Name of the Lord blessed before this, and before all ages? I will answer the
infant, who asketh not in contumacy. Unto you it is said, masters and children, unto you it
is said, “Praise the Name of the Lord; blessed be the Name of the Lord:” let the Name of the
Lord be blessed, “from this,” that is, from the moment ye speak these words. For ye begin
to praise, but praise ye without end.…Or, since in this passage he seemeth to signify rather
humility than childhood, the contrary of which is the vain and false greatness of pride; and
for this reason none but children praise the Lord, since the proud know not how to praise
Him; let old age be childlike, and your childhood like old age; that is, that neither may your
wisdom be with pride, nor your humility without wisdom, that ye may “praise the Lord
from this for evermore.” Wherever the Church of Christ is diffused in her childlike saints,
“Praise ye the Name of the Lord;” that is, “from the rising up of the sun unto the going down
of the same.”
3. “The Lord is high above all heathen” (ver. 4). The heathen are men: what wonder if
the Lord be above all men? They see with their eyes those whom they worship high above
themselves to shine in heaven, the sun and moon and stars, creatures which they serve while
they neglect the Creator. But not only “is the Lord high above all heathen;” but “His glory”
also “is above the heavens.” The heavens look up unto Him above themselves; and the
humble have Him together with them, who do not worship the heavens instead of Him,
though placed in the flesh beneath the heavens.

Psalm CXIII
Psalm CXIII
4. “Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath His dwelling so high; and yet beholdeth
the humble?” (ver. 5). Any one would think that He dwelleth in the lofty heavens, whence
He may behold the humble things on earth; but “He beholdeth the humble things that are
in heaven and earth” (ver. 6): what then is His high dwelling, whence He beholdeth the
humble things that are in heaven and earth? Are the humble things He beholdeth His own
high dwelling itself? For He thus exalteth the humble, so as not to make them proud. He
therefore both dwelleth in those whom He raiseth high, and maketh them heaven for
Himself, that is, His own abode; and by seeing them not proud, but constantly subject to
Himself, He beholdeth even in heaven itself these very humble things, in whom raised on
high He dwelleth. For the Spirit thus speaketh through Isaiah: “Thus saith the Highest that
dwelleth on high, that inhabiteth eternity; the Lord Most High, dwelling in the holy.” He
hath expounded what He meant by dwelling on high, by the more full expression, “dwelling
in the holy.”…
5. And he hath moved us also to enquire whether the Lord our God beholdeth the same
humble things in heaven and in earth: or different humble things in heaven to what He be-
holdeth on earth.…But if the Lord our God beholdeth other humble things in heaven to
what He doth on earth; I suppose that He already beholdeth in heaven those whom He hath
called, and in whom He dwelleth; while on earth He beholdeth those whom He is now
calling, that He may dwell in them. For He hath the one with Him musing on heavenly
things, the others He is waking, while they yet dream things earthly. But since it is difficult
to call even those humble, who have not as yet submitted their necks in piety to the gracious
yoke of Christ, since the divine writings throughout the whole Psalm warn us to understand
holy by the word humble; there is also another interpretation, which, Beloved, ye may con-
sider with me. I believe that those are now meant by heavens who shall sit upon twelve
thrones, and shall judge with the Lord;5032 and under the name of the earth, the rest of the
multitude of the blessed, who shall be set on the right hand, that through works of mercy
they may be praised and received into everlasting habitations by those whom they have
made friends to themselves from the mammon of unrighteousness in this mortal life.5033…
6. “He taketh up the destitute out of the dust, and lifteth the poor out of the mire” (ver.
7); “that He may set Him with the princes, even with the princes of His people” (ver. 8). Let
not then the heads of the exalted disdain to be humble, beneath the Lord’s right hand. For
though the faithful steward of the Lord’s money be placed together with the princes of the
people of God, although he be destined to sit on the twelve seats, and even to judge angels;5034
5032 Matt. xix. 28.
5033 Luke xvi. 9.
5034 Matt. xix. 28.
Psalm CXIII
yet he is taken up destitute from the dust, and lifted from out of the mire. Was not he possibly
lifted up from the mire, who “served divers lusts and pleasures”?…
7. What then, brethren, if we have already heard of those humble things which are in
heaven, lifted up from the mire, that they might be set with the princes of the people; have
we by consequence heard nothing of the humble things which the Lord beholdeth on the
earth? For those friends who will judge with their Lord are fewer, while those whom they
receive into everlasting habitations are more in number. For although the whole of a heap
of corn compared with the separate chaff may seem to contain few in number; yet considered
by itself, it is abundant.…The Church then speaketh thus in that sense, wherein she seemeth
to bear no offspring among those crowds who have not given up all things, that they might
follow the Lord, and might sit upon the twelve thrones.5035 But how many in the same
crowd, who make unto themselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,5036 shall
stand on the right hand through works of mercy? He not only then lifteth up from the mire
him whom He is to place with the princes of His people; but also, “Maketh the barren woman
to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children” (ver. 9): He who dwelleth on high, and
beholdeth the humble things that are in heaven and earth, the seed of Abraham like the
stars of heaven, holiness set on high in heavenly habitations; and like the sand on the sea
shore, a merciful and countless multitude gathered together from the harmful waves, and
the bitterness of impiety.

Psalm CXIII
Psalm CXIV.5037
1. The river Jordan, when they were entering across it into the land of promise, when
touched by the feet of the priests who bore the Ark, stood still from above with bridled
stream, while it flowed down from below, where it ran on into the sea, until the whole people
passed over, the priests standing on the dry ground.5038 We know these things, but yet we
should not imagine in this Psalm, to which we have now answered by chanting Allelujah,
that it is the purpose of the Holy Spirit, that while we call to mind those deeds of the past,
we should not consider things like unto them yet to take place. For “these things,” as the
Apostle saith, “happened unto them for ensamples.”5039
2. “When Israel came out of Egypt, and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people” (ver. 1), “Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion” (ver. 2); “the sea saw
that and fled, Jordan was driven back” (ver. 3). Think not that past deeds are related unto
us, but rather that the future is predicted; since, while those miracles also were going on in
that people, things present indeed were happening, but not without an intimation of things
future.…Some things he has related differently to what we have learnt and read there: that
he might not truly be thought to be repeating past acts rather than to be prophesying future
things. For in the first place, we read not that the Jordan was driven back, but that it stood
still on the side nearest the source of its streams, while the people were passing through;
next, we read not of the mountains and hills skipping: all which he hath added, and repeated.
For after saying, “The sea saw that, and fled; Jordan was driven back:” he added, “The
mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like young sheep” (ver. 4): and then asketh,
“What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou, Jordan, that thou wast driven
back?” (ver. 5). “Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like young
sheep?” (ver. 6).
3. Let us therefore consider what we are taught here; since both those deeds were typical
of us, and these words exhort us to recognise ourselves. For if we hold with a firm heart the
grace of God which hath been given us, we are Israel, the seed of Abraham: unto us the
Apostle saith, “Therefore are ye the seed of Abraham.”5040…Let therefore no Christian
consider himself alien to the name of Israel. For we are joined in the corner stone with those
among the Jews who believed, among whom we find the Apostles chief. Hence our Lord in
another passage saith, “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must
bring, that there may be one fold and one Shepherd.”5041 The Christian people then is rather

Israel, and the same is preferably the house of Jacob; for Israel and Jacob are the same. But
that multitude of Jews, which was deservedly reprobated for its perfidy, for the pleasures of
the flesh sold their birthright, so that they belonged not to Jacob, but rather to Esau. For ye
know that it was said with this hidden meaning, “That the elder shall serve the younger.”5042
4. But Egypt, since it is said to mean affliction, or one who afflicteth, or one who oppres-
seth, is often used for an emblem of this world; from which we must spiritually withdraw,
that we may not be bearing the yoke with unbelievers.5043 For thus each one becometh a fit
citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem, when he hath first renounced this world; just as that people
could not be led into the land of promise, save first they had departed from Egypt. But as
they did not depart thence, until freed by Divine help; so no man is turned away in heart
from this world, unless aided by the gift of the Divine mercy. For what was there once pre-
figured, the same is fulfilled in every faithful one in the daily travailings of the Church, in
this end of the world, in this, as the blessed John writeth, last time.5044 Hear the Apostle the
teacher of the Gentiles, thus instructing us: “I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant,
how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all
baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and
did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed
them, and that rock was Christ. But with many of them God was not well pleased, for they
were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples.”5045 What more
do ye wish, most beloved brethren? For it is surely clear, not from human conjecture, but
from the declaration of an Apostle, that is, of God and our Lord: for God spoke in them,
and though from clouds of flesh, yet it was God who thundered: surely then it is clear by so
great testimony that all these things which were done in figure, are now fulfilled in our sal-
vation; because then the future was predicted, now the past is read, and the present observed.
5. Hear what is even more wonderful, that the hidden and veiled mysteries of the ancient
books are in some degree revealed by the ancient books. For Micah the prophet speaketh
thus. “According to the days of thy coming out of Egypt will I show unto him marvellous
things, etc.5046…In this Psalm, therefore, although the wonderful spirit of prophecy doth
look into the future, yet it seemeth, as it were, to be merely detailing to the past. “Judah,”
he saith, “was His sanctuary: the sea saw that and fled:” “was,” “saw,” and “fled,” are words
of the past tense; and “Jordan was driven back, and the mountains skipped, and the earth
trembled,” in like manner have a past expression, without, however, any difficulty in under-

standing by them the future.…For though it was so long after the departure of that people
from Egypt, and so long before these seasons of the Church, that he sang what I have quoted;
nevertheless, he witnesseth that he is foretelling the future without any question. “According
to the days,” he saith, “of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I show unto him marvellous
things.” “The nations shall see and be confounded.” This is what is here said, “The sea saw
that, and fled:” for if in this passage, through words of the past tense the future is secretly
revealed, as is the case; who would venture to explain the words, “shall see and be confoun-
ded,” of past events? And a little lower down he5047 alludeth more clearly than light itself
to those very enemies of ours, who followed us flying, that they might slay us, that is, our
sins, which are overwhelmed and extinguished in Baptism, just as the Egyptians were
drowned in the sea, saying, since “He retaineth not His anger for ever, because He is of good
will and merciful, He will turn again, He will have compassion upon us, He will drown our
iniquities: and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.”
6. What is it, most beloved? ye who know yourselves to be Israelites according to Abra-
ham’s seed, ye who are of the house of Jacob, heirs according to promise, know that even
ye have gone forth from Egypt, since ye have renounced this world; that ye have gone forth
from a foreign people, since by the confession of piety, ye have separated yourselves from
the blasphemies of the Gentiles. For it is not your tongue, but a foreign one, which knoweth
not how to praise God, to whom ye sing Allelujah. For “Judah” hath become “His sanctuary”
in you; for “he is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is
outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and by circumcision of the
heart.”5048 Examine then your hearts, if faith hath circumcised them, if confession hath
cleansed them; in you “Judah” hath become “His sanctuary,” in you “Israel” hath become
“His dominion.” For “He gave” unto you “the power to become the sons of God.”5049…
7. But I would not that ye should seek without yourselves, how the Jordan was turned
back, I would not ye should augur anything evil. For the Lord chideth those who have
“turned” their “back” unto Him, “and not their face.”5050 And whoever forsaketh the source
of his being, and turneth away from his Creator; as a river into the sea, he glides into the
bitter wickedness of this world. It is therefore good for him that he turn back, and that God
whom he had set behind his back, may be before his face as he returneth; and that the sea
of this world, which he had set before his face, when he was gliding on towards it, may become
behind him; and that he may so forget what is behind him, that he may “reach forward to
what is before him;”5051 which is profitable for him when once converted.…

“Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”5052 For the earth trembled; but
because it had remained slothful, it was made to tremble, so that it might be more firmly
fixed at the presence of the Lord.
9. “Who turned the hard rock into standing waters, and the flint stone into springing
wells” (ver. 8). For He melted Himself, and what may be called His hardness to water those
who believe on Him, that He might in them become “a fountain of water gushing forth
unto everlasting life;”5053 because formerly, when He was not known, He seemed hard.
Hence they who said, “This is an hard saying, who can bear it?”5054 were confounded, and
waited not until He should flow and stream upon them when the Scriptures were revealed.
The rock, that hardness, was turned into pools of water, that stone into fountains of waters,
when on His resurrection, “He expounded unto them, commencing with Moses and all the
prophets, how Christ ought to suffer thus;”5055 and sent the Holy Ghost, of whom He said,
“If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.”5056

Psalm CXV.5057
1. “Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy Name give the praise” (ver. 1). For
that grace of the water that gushed from the rock (“now that rock was Christ”5058), was not
given on the score of works that had gone before, but of His mercy “that justifieth the un-
godly.”5059 For “Christ died for sinners,”5060 that men might not seek any glory of their
own, but in the Lord’s Name.
2. “For Thy loving mercy, and for Thy truth’s sake” (ver. 2). Observe how often these
two qualities, loving mercy and truth, are joined together in the holy Scriptures. For in His
loving mercy He called sinners, and in His truth He judgeth those who when called refused
to come. “That the heathen may not say, Where is now their God?” For at the last, His loving
mercy and truth will shine forth, when “the sign of the Son of man shall appear in heaven,
and then shall all tribes of the earth cry woe;” 5061 nor shall they then say, “Where is their
God?” when He is no longer preached unto them to be believed in, but displayed before
them to be trembled at.
3. “As for our God, He is in heaven above” (ver. 3). Not in heaven, where they see the
sun and moon, works of God which they adore, but “in heaven above,” which overpasseth
all heavenly and earthly bodies. Nor is our God in heaven in such a sense, as to dread a fall
that should deprive Him of His throne, if heaven were withdrawn from under Him. “In
heaven and earth He hath made whatsoever pleased Him.” Nor doth He stand in need of
His own works, as if He had place in them where He might abide; but endureth in His own
eternity, wherein He abideth and hath done whatsoever pleased Him, both in heaven and
earth; for they did not support Him, as a condition of their being created by Him: since,
unless they had been created, they could not have supported Him. Therefore, in whatsoever
He Himself dwelleth, He, so to speak, containeth this as in need of Himself, He is not con-
tained by this as if He needed it. Or it may be thus understood: “In heaven and in earth He
hath done whatsoever pleased Him,” whether among the higher or the lower orders of His
people, He hath made His grace His free gift, that no man may boast in the merits of his
own works.…
4. “Their idols,” he saith, “are silver and gold, even the work of men’s hands” (ver. 4).
That is, although we cannot display our God to your carnal eyes, whom ye ought to recognise
through his works; yet be not seduced by your vain pretences, because ye can point with
the finger to, the objects of your worship. For it were much worthier for you not to have

what to point to, than that your hearts’ blindness should be displayed in what is exhibited
to these eyes by you: for what do ye exhibit, save gold and silver? They have indeed both
bronze, and wood, and earthenware idols, and of different materials of this description; but
the Holy Spirit preferred mentioning the more precious material, because when every man
hath blushed for that which he sets more by, he is much more easily turned away from the
worship of meaner objects. For it is said in another passage of Scripture concerning the
worshippers of images, “Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast
brought me forth.”5062 But lest that man who speaketh thus not to a stone or stock, but to
gold and silver, seem wiser to himself; let him look this way, let him turn hitherwards the
ear of his heart: “The idols of the Gentiles are gold and silver.” Nothing mean and contempt-
ible is here mentioned: and indeed to that mind which is not earth, both gold and silver is
earth, but more beautiful and brilliant, more solid and firm. Employ not then the hands of
men, to create a false Deity out of that metal which a true God hath created; nay, a false
man, whom thou mayest worship for a true God.…
5. “For they have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not” (ver. 5). “They
have ears, and hear not: noses have they, and smell not” (ver. 6). “They have hands, and
handle not; feet have they, and walk not; neither cry they through their throat” (ver. 7). Even
their artist therefore surpasseth them, since he had the faculty of moulding them by the
motion and functions of his limbs: though thou wouldest be ashamed to worship that artist.
Even thou surpassest them, though thou hast not made these things, since thou doest what
they cannot do. Even a beast doth excel them; for unto this it is added, “neither cry they
through their throat.” For after he had said above, “they have mouths, and speak not;” what
need was there, after he had enumerated the limbs from head to feet, to repeat what he had
said of their crying through their throat; unless, I suppose, because we perceive that what
he mentioned of the other members, was common to men and beasts? For they see, and
hear, and smell, and walk, and some, apes for instance, handle with hands. But what he had
said of the mouth, is peculiar to men: since beasts do not speak. But that no one might refer
what hath been said to the works of human members alone, and prefer men only to the gods
of the heathen; after all this he added these words, “neither cry they through their throat:”
which again is common to men and cattle.…How much better then do mice and serpents,
and other animals of like sort, judge of the idols of the heathen, so to speak, for they regard
not the human figure in them when they see not the human life. For this reason they usually
build nests in them, and unless they are deterred by human movements, they seek for
themselves no safer habitations. A man then moveth himself, that he may frighten away a
living beast from his own god; and yet worshippeth that god who cannot move himself, as
5062 Jer. ii. 27.
Psalm CXV
if he were powerful, from whom he drove away one better than the object of his wor-
ship.…Even the dead surpasseth a deity who neither liveth nor hath lived.…
6. But they seem to themselves to have a purer religion, who say, I neither worship an
idol, nor a devil; but in the bodily image I behold an emblem5063 of that which I am bound
to worship.…They presume to reply, that they worship not the bodies themselves, but the
deities which preside over the government of them. One sentence of the Apostle, therefore,
testifieth to their punishment and condemnation; “Who,” he saith, “have changed the truth
of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is
blessed for ever.”5064 For in the former part of this sentence he condemned idols; in the
latter, the account they give of their idols: for by designating images wrought by an artificer
by the names of the works of God’s creation, they change the truth of God into a lie; while,
by considering these works themselves as deities, and worshipping them as such, they serve
the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.…
7. But, it will be said, we also have very many instruments and vessels made of materials
or metal of this description for the purpose of celebrating the Sacraments, which being
consecrated by these ministrations are called holy, in honour of Him who is thus worshipped
for our salvation: and what indeed are these very instruments or vessels, but the work of
men’s hands? But have they mouth, and yet speak not? have they eyes, and see not? do we
pray unto them, because through them we pray to God? This is the chief cause of this insane
profanity, that the figure resembling the living person, which induces men to worship it,
hath more influence in the minds of these miserable persons, than the evident fact that it is
not living, so that it ought to be despised by the living.5065
8. The result that ensueth is that described in the next verse: “They that make them are
like unto them, and so are all such as put their trust in them” (ver. 8). Let them therefore
see with open eyes, and worship with shut and dead understandings, idols that neither see
nor live. “But the house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord” (ver. 9). “For hope that is seen is
not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see
not, then do we with patience wait for it.”5066 But that this patience may endure to the end,
“He is their helper and defender.” Do perhaps spiritual persons (by whom carnal minds are
built up in “the spirit of meekness,”5067 because they pray as higher for lower minds) already
see, and is that already to them reality which to the lower is hope? It is not so. For even “the
house of Aaron hath hope in the Lord” (ver. 10). Therefore, that they also may stretch forward

perseveringly towards those things which are before them, and may run perseveringly, until
they may apprehend that for which they are apprehended, 5068 and may know even as they
are known,5069 “He is their helper and defender.” For both “fear the Lord, and have hoped
in the Lord: He is their helper and defender” (ver. 11).
9. For we do not by our deservings prevent the mercy of God; but, “The Lord hath been
mindful of us, and hath blessed us. He hath blessed the house of Israel, He hath blessed the
house of Aaron” (ver. 12). But in blessing both of these, “He hath blessed all that fear the
Lord” (ver. 13). Dost thou ask, who are meant by both of these? He answereth, “both small
and great.” That is, the house of Israel with the house of Aaron, those who among that nation
believed in Jesus the Saviour.…For in the character of those who out of that nation believed,
it is said, “Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been
made like unto Gomorrha.”5070 Seed, because when it has been scattered over the earth, it
multiplied.
10. For the great ones, of the house of Aaron, have said, “May the Lord increase you
more and more, you and your children” (ver. 14). And thus it hath happened. For children
that have been raised even from the stones have flocked unto Abraham:5071 sheep which
were not of this fold, have flocked unto him, that there might be one flock, and one shep-
herd;5072 the faith of all nations was added, and the number grew, not only of wise priests,
but of obedient peoples; the Lord increasing not only their fathers more and more, who in
Christ might show the way to the rest who should imitate them, but also their children, who
should follow their fathers’ pious footsteps.
11. Therefore the Prophet saith unto these great and small, the mountains and the little
hills, the rams and the young sheep, what followeth: “Ye are the blessed of the Lord, who
made heaven and earth” (ver. 15). As if he should say, Ye are the blessed of the Lord, who
made the heaven in the great, earth in the small: not this visible heaven, studded with lu-
minaries which are objects to these eyes. For “The heaven of heavens is the Lord’s” (ver.
16); who hath elevated the minds of some saints to such a height, that they became teachable
by no man, but by God Himself; in comparison of which heaven, whatever is discerned with
carnal eyes is to be called earth; which “He hath given to the children of men;” that when it
is contemplated, whether in that region which illumineth above, as that which is called
heaven, or in that which is illumined beneath, which is properly called earth (since in com-

parison with that which is called heaven of heaven, the whole, as we have said, is earth;) the
whole therefore of this earth He hath given to the children of men, that by the consideration
of it, as far as they can, they may conceive of the Creator, whom with their yet weak hearts
they cannot see without that aid to their conception.
12. …But nevertheless since they derive the truth and richness of wisdom, not from
man nor through man, but through God Himself, they have received little ones who shall
be heaven, that they may know that they are heaven of heaven; as yet however earth, unto
which they say, “I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.”5073 For to
those very sons of men whom He made heaven, He who knoweth how to provide for the
earth through heaven, hath given earth upon which they work. May they therefore abide,
heaven and earth, in their God, who made them, and let them live from Him, confessing
unto Him, and praising Him; for if they choose to live from themselves, they shall die, as it
is written, “From the dead, as though he were not, confession ceaseth.”5074 But, “The dead
praise not Thee, O Lord, neither all they that go down into silence” (ver. 17). For the Scripture
in another passage proclaimeth, “The sinner, when he cometh into the abyss of wickednesses,
scorneth.”5075 “But we, who live, will praise the Lord, from this time forth for evermore”
(ver. 18).

Psalm CXV
Psalm CXVI.5076
1. “I have loved, since the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer” (ver. 1). Let the soul
that is sojourning in absence from the Lord sing thus, let that sheep which had strayed sing
thus, let that son who had “died and returned to life,” who had “been lost and was found;”5077
let our soul sing thus, brethren, and most beloved sons. Let us be taught, and let us abide,
and let us sing thus with the Saints: “I have loved: since the Lord will hear the voice of my
prayer.” Is this a reason for having loved, that the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer?
and do we not rather love, because He hath heard, or that He may hear? What then meaneth,
“I have loved, since the Lord will hear”? Doth he, because hope is wont to inflame love, say
that he hath loved, since he hath hoped that God will listen to the voice of his prayer?
2. But whence hath he hoped for this? Since, he saith, “He hath inclined His ear unto
me: and in my days I have called upon Him” (ver. 2). I loved, therefore, because He will
hear; He will hear, “because He hath inclined His ear unto me.” But whence knowest thou,
O human soul, that God hath inclined His ear unto thee, except thou sayest, “I have believed”?
These three things, therefore, “abide, faith, hope, charity:”5078 because thou hast believed,
thou hast hoped; because thou hast hoped, thou hast loved.…
3. And what are thy days, since thou hast said, “In my days I have called upon Him”?
Are they those perchance, in which “the fulness of time came,” and “God sent His Son,”5079
who had already said, “In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation
have I helped thee”?5080…I may rather call my days the days of my misery, the days of my
mortality, the days according to Adam, full of toil and sweat, the days according to the ancient
corruption. “For I lying, stuck fast in the deep mire,”5081 in another Psalm also have cried
out, “Behold, Thou hast made my days old;”5082 in these days of mine have I called upon
Thee. For my days are different from the days of my Lord. I call those my days, which by
my own daring I have made for myself, whereby I have forsaken Him: and, since He reigneth
everywhere, and is all-powerful, and holdeth all things, I have deserved prison; that is, I
have received the darkness of ignorance, and the bonds of mortality.…For in these days of
mine, “The snares of death compassed me round about, and the pains of hell gat hold upon
me” (ver. 3): pains that would not have overtaken me, had I not wandered from Thee. But

now they have overtaken me; but I found them not, while I was rejoicing in the prosperity
of the world, in which the snares of hell deceive the more.
4. But after “I too found trouble and heaviness, I called upon the Name of the Lord”
(ver. 4). For trouble and profitable sorrow I did not feel; trouble, wherein He giveth aid,
unto whom it is said, “O be Thou our help in trouble: and vain is the help of man.”5083 For
I thought I might rejoice and exult in the vain help of man; but when I had heard from my
Lord, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted:”5084 I did not wait until I
should lose those temporal blessings in which I rejoiced, and should then mourn: but I gave
heed to that very misery of mine which caused me to rejoice in such things, which I both
feared to lose, and yet could not retain; I gave heed to it firmly and courageously, and I saw
that I was not only agonized by the adversities of this world, but even bound by its good
fortune; and thus “I found the trouble and heaviness” which had escaped me, “and called
upon the Name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech Thee, deliver my soul.” Let then the holy
people of God say, “I called upon the Name of the Lord:” and let the remainder of the heathen
hear, who do not as yet call upon the Name of the Lord; let them hear and seek, that they
may discover trouble and heaviness, and may call upon the Name of the Lord, and be saved.…
5. “Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful” (ver. 5). He is gracious,
righteous, and merciful. Gracious in the first place, because He hath inclined His ear unto
me; and I knew not that the ear of God had approached my lips, till I was aroused by those
beautiful feet, that I might call upon the Lord’s Name: for who hath called upon Him, save
he whom He first called? Hence therefore He is in the first place “gracious;” but “righteous,”
because He scourgeth; and again, “merciful,” because He receiveth; for “He scourgeth every
son whom He receiveth;” nor ought it to be so bitter to me that He scourgeth, as sweet that
He receiveth. For how should not “The Lord, who keepeth little ones” (ver. 6), scourge those
whom, when of mature age, He seeketh to be heirs; “for what son is he whom the father
chasteneth not?” 5085 “I was in misery, and He helped me.” He helped me, because I was in
misery; for the pain which the physician causeth by his knife is not penal, but salutary.
6. “Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath done good to thee” (ver.
7): not for thy deservings, or through thy strength; but because the Lord hath done good to
thee. “Since,” he saith, “He hath delivered my soul from death” (ver. 8). It is wonderful,
most beloved brethren, that, after he had said that his soul should turn unto rest, since the
Lord had rewarded him; he added, since “He hath delivered my soul from death.” Did it
turn unto rest, because it was delivered from death? Is not rest more usually said of death?
What is the action of him whose life is rest, and death disquietude? Such then ought to be
5083 Ps. lx. 11.
5084 Matt. v. 4.
5085 Heb. xii. 6, 7.
Psalm CXVI
the action of the soul, as may tend to a quiet security, not one that may increase restless toil;
since He hath delivered it from death, who, pitying it, said, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,” etc.5086 Meek therefore and humble, following,
so to speak, Christ as its path, should the action of the soul be that tendeth towards repose;
nevertheless, not slothful and supine; that it may finish its course, as it is written, “In quietness
make perfect thy works.”5087 “Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling.” Whoever feeleth the chain of this flesh, chanteth these things
as fulfilled in hope towards himself. For it is truly said, “I was in misery, and He delivered
me;” but the Apostle saith this also truly, that we are saved by hope.5088 And that we are
delivered from death, is well said to be already fulfilled, so that we may understand the death
of unbelievers, of whom he saith, “Leave the dead to bury their dead.”5089…He will then
clear our eyes of tears, when He shall save our feet from falling. For there will then be no
slipping of our feet as they walk, when there will be no sliding of the weak flesh. But now,
however firm our path, which is Christ, be; yet since we place flesh, which we are enjoined
to subdue, beneath us; in the very work of chastening and subduing it, it is a great thing not
to fall: but not to slip in the flesh, who can attain? “I shall please in the sight of the Lord, in
the land of the living” (ver. 9).…We “labour” indeed now, because we are awaiting “the re-
demption of our body:”5090 but, “when death shall have been swallowed up in victory, and
this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality;”5091 then there
will be no weeping, because there will be no falling; and no falling, because no corruption.
And therefore we shall then no longer labour to please, but we shall be entirely pleasing in
the sight of the Lord, in the land of the living.
7. …“I believed,” saith he, “and therefore did I speak. But I was sorely brought down”
(ver. 10). For he suffered many tribulations, for the sake of the word which he faithfully
held, faithfully preached; and he was sorely brought down; as they feared who loved the
praise of men better than that of God. But what meaneth, “But I”? He should rather say, I
believed, and therefore I have spoken, and I was sorely brought down: why did he add, “But
I,” save because a man may be sorely brought down by those who oppose the truth, the truth
itself cannot, which he believeth and speaketh? Whence also the Apostle, when he was
speaking of his chain, saith, “the word of God is not bound.”5092 So this man also, since

Psalm CXVI
there is one person of the holy witnesses, that is, of the Martyrs of God, saith, “I believed,
and therefore will I speak.” “But I;” not that which I believed, not the word which I have
delivered; “but I was sorely brought down.”
8. “I said in my trance, All men are liars” (ver. 11). By trance he meaneth fear, which
when persecutors threaten, and when the sufferings of torture or death impend, human
weakness suffereth. For this we understand, because in this Psalm the voice of Martyrs is
heard. For trance is used in another sense also, when the mind is not beside itself by fear,
but is possessed by some inspiration of revelation. “But I said in my haste, All men are liars.”
In consternation he hath had regard to his infirmity, and hath seen that he ought not to
presume on himself; for as far as pertaineth to the man himself, he is a liar, but by the grace
of God he is made true; lest yielding to the pressure of his enemies he might not speak what
he had believed, but might deny it; even as it happened to Peter, since he had trusted in
himself, and was to be taught that we ought not to trust in man. And if every one ought not
to trust in man, surely not in himself; because he is a man. Rightly therefore in his fear did
he perceive that every man was a liar; since they also whom no fear robs of their presence
of mind, so that they never lie by yielding to the persecutors, are such by the gifts of God,
not by their own strength.…
9. “What,” he asketh, “what reward shall I give unto the Lord, for all the benefits that
He hath returned unto me?” (ver. 12). He saith not, for all the benefits that He hath done
unto me but “for all the benefits that He hath returned unto me.” What deeds then on the
man’s part had preceded, that all the benefits of God were not said to be given, but returned?
What had preceded, on the man’s part, save sins? God therefore repayeth good for evil,
whilst unto Him men repay evil for good; for such was the return of those who said, “This
is the heir: come, let us kill him.” 5093
10. But this man seeketh what he may return unto the Lord, and findeth not, save out
of those things which the Lord Himself returneth. “I will receive,” he saith, “the cup of sal-
vation, and call upon the Name of the Lord” (ver. 13). “My vows will I render to the Lord,
before all His people” (ver. 14). Who hath given thee the cup of salvation, which when thou
takest, and callest upon the Name of the Lord, thou shalt return unto Him a reward for all
that He hath returned unto thee? Who, save He who saith, “Are ye able to drink the cup
that I shall drink of?”5094 Who hath given unto thee to imitate His sufferings, save He who
hath suffered before for thee? And therefore, “Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death
of His Saints” (ver. 15). He purchased it by His Blood, which He first shed for the salvation
of slaves, that they might not hesitate to shed their blood for the Lord’s Name; which, nev-
ertheless, would be profitable for their own interests, not for those of the Lord.

Psalm CXVI
11. Let therefore the slave purchased at so great a price confess his condition, and say,
“Behold, O Lord, how that I am Thy servant: “I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine
handmaid” (ver. 16).…This, therefore, is the son of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is above,
the free mother of us all.5095 And free indeed from sin she is, but the handmaid of righteous-
ness; to whose sons still pilgrims it is said, “Ye have been called unto liberty;”5096 and again
he maketh them servants, when he saith, “but by love serve one another.”…Let therefore
that servant say unto God, Many call themselves martyrs, many Thy servants, because they
hold Thy Name in various heresies and errors; but since they are beside Thy Church, they
are not the children of Thy handmaid. But “I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine hand-
maid.” “Thou hast broken my bonds asunder.”
12. “I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise” (ver. 17). For I have not found any deserts
of mine, since Thou hast broken my bonds asunder; I therefore owe Thee the sacrifice of
praise; because, although I will boast that I am Thy servant, and the son of Thy handmaid,
I will glory not in myself, but in Thee, my Lord, who hast broken asunder my bonds, that
when I return from my desertion, I may again be bound unto Thee.
13. “I will pay my vows unto the Lord” (ver. 18). What vows wilt thou pay? What victims
hast thou vowed? what burnt-offerings, what holocausts? Dost thou refer to what thou hast
said a little before, “I will receive the cup of salvation, and will call upon the Name of the
Lord;” and, “I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving”? and indeed whosoever well
considereth what he is vowing to the Lord, and what vows he is paying, let him vow himself,
let him pay himself as a vow: this is exacted, this is due. On looking at the coin, the Lord
saith, “Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which
are God’s:”5097 his own image is rendered unto Cæsar: let His image be rendered unto God.
14. “In the courts,” he saith, “of the Lord’s house” (ver. 19). What is the Lord’s house,
the same is the Lord’s handmaid: and what is God’s house, save all His people? It therefore
followeth, “In the sight of all His people.” And now he more openly nameth his mother
herself. For what else is His people, but what followeth, “In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem”?
For than that which is returned grateful, if it be returned from peace, and in peace. But they
who are not sons of this handmaid, have loved war rather than peace.…

courts of the Lord’s house, this all His people, this the true Jerusalem. Let those rather listen
who have refused to be the children of this city, since they have cut themselves off from the
communion of all nations.5099 “For His merciful kindness is ever more and more towards
us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever” (ver. 2). These are those two things, loving-
kindness and truth, which in the CXVth Psalm I admonished you should be committed to
memory. But “the merciful kindness of the Lord is ever more and more towards us,” since
the furious tongues of hostile nations have yielded to His Name, through which we have
been freed: “and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever,” whether in those things which He
promised to the righteous, or in those which He hath threatened to the ungodly.

Psalm CXVII
Psalm CXVII
Psalm CXVIII.5100
1. …We are taught in this Psalm, when we chaunt Allelujah, which meaneth, Praise the
Lord, that we should, when we hear the words, “Confess unto the Lord” (ver. 1), praise the
Lord. The praise of God could not be expressed in fewer words than these, “For He is good.”
I see not what can be more solemn than this brevity, since goodness is so peculiarly the
quality of God, that the Son of God Himself when addressed by some one as “Good Master,”
by one, namely, who beholding His flesh, and comprehending not the fulness of His divine
nature, considered Him as man only, replied, “Why callest thou Me good? There is none
good but one, that is, God.”5101 And what is this but to say, If thou wishest to call Me good,
recognise Me as God? But since it is addressed, in revelation of things to come, to a people
freed from all toil and wandering in pilgrimage, and from all admixture with the wicked,
which freedom was given it through the grace of God, who not only doth not evil for evil,
but even returneth good for evil; it is most appropriately added, “Because His mercy endureth
for ever.”
2. “Let Israel now confess that He is good, and that His mercy endureth for ever” (ver.
2). “Let the house of Aaron now confess that His mercy endureth for ever” (ver. 3). “Yea,
let all now that fear the Lord confess that His mercy endureth for ever” (ver. 4). Ye remember,
I suppose, most beloved, what is the house of Israel, what is the house of Aaron, and that
both are those that fear the Lord. For they are “the little and the great,”5102 who have already
in another Psalm been happily introduced into your hearts: in the number of whom all of
us should rejoice that we are joined together, in His grace who is good, and whose mercy
endureth for ever; since they were listened to who said, “May the Lord increase you more
and more, you and your children;”5103 that the host of the Gentiles might be added to the
Israelites who believed in Christ, of the number of whom are the Apostles our fathers, for
the exaltation of the perfect and the obedience of the little children; that all of us when made
one in Christ, made one flock under one Shepherd, and the body of that Head, like one man,
may say, “I called upon the Lord in trouble, and the Lord heard me at large” (ver. 5). The
narrow straits of our tribulation are limited: but the large way whereby we pass along hath
no end. “Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?”5104
3. “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man doeth unto me” (ver. 6). But are
men, then, the only enemies that the Church hath? What is a man devoted to flesh and
blood, save flesh and blood? But the Apostle saith, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood,

but against,”…he saith, “spiritual wickedness in high places;”5105 that is, the devil and his
angels; that devil whom elsewhere he calleth “the prince of the power of the air.”5106 Hear
therefore what followeth: “The Lord is my helper: therefore shall I despise mine enemies”
(ver. 7). From what class soever my enemies may arise, whether from the number of evil
men, or from the number of evil angels; in the Lord’s help, unto whom we chant the confes-
sion of praise, unto whom we sing Allelujah, they shall be despised.
4. But, when my enemies have been brought to contempt, let not my friend present
himself unto me as a good man, so as to bid me repose my hope in himself: for “It is better
to trust in the Lord, than to put any confidence in man” (ver. 8). Nor let any one, who may
in a certain sense be styled a good angel, be regarded by myself as one in whom I ought to
put my trust: for “no one is good, save God alone;” 5107 and when a man or an angel appear
to aid us, when they do this of sincere affection, He doth it through them, who made them
good after their measure. “It is” therefore “better to trust in the Lord, than to put any con-
fidence in princes” (ver. 9). For angels also are called princes, even as we read in Daniel,
“Michael, your prince.”5108
5. “All nations compassed me round about, but in the Name of the Lord have I taken
vengeance on them” (ver. 10). “They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on
every side; but in the Name of the Lord have I taken vengeance on them” (ver. 11). He sig-
nifieth the toils and the victory of the Church; but, as if the question were asked how she
could have overcome so great evils, he looketh back to the example, and declareth what she
had first suffered in her Head, by adding what followeth, “They kept me in on every side:”
and the words, “All nations,” are with reason not repeated here, because this was the act of
the Jews alone. There that very religious nation (which is the body of Christ, and in behalf
of which was done all that was done in mortal form with immortal power, by that inward
divinity, through the outward flesh), suffered from persecutors, of whose race that flesh was
assumed and hung upon the cross.
6. “They came about me as bees do a hive, and burned up even as the fire among the
thorns: and in the Name of the Lord have I taken vengeance on them” (ver. 12). Here then
the order of the words corresponds with the order of events. For we rightly understand that
our Lord Himself, the Head of the Church, was surrounded by persecutors, even as bees
surround a hive. For the Holy Spirit is speaking with mystic subtlety of what was done by
those who knew not what they did. For bees make honey in the hives: while our Lord’s
persecutors, unconscious as they were, rendered Him sweeter unto us even by His very

Passion; so that we may taste and see how sweet is the Lord,5109 “Who died for our sins,
and arose for our justification.”5110 But what followeth, “and burned up even as the fire
among the thorns,” is better understood of His Body, that is, of a people spread abroad,
whom all nations compassed about, since it was gathered together from all nations. They
consumed this sinful flesh, and the grievous piercings of this mortal life, in the flame of
persecution. “Taken vengeance on them:” either because they themselves, that wickedness,
which in them persecuted the righteous, having been extinguished, were joined with the
people of Christ; or because the rest of them, who have at this time scorned the mercy of
Him who calleth them, will at the end feel the truth of Him who judgeth them.
7. “I have been driven on like a heap of sand, so that I was falling, but the Lord upheld
me” (ver. 13). For though there were a great multitude of believers, that might be compared
to the countless sand, and brought into one communion as into one heap; yet “what is man,
save Thou be mindful of Him?”5111 He said not, the multitude of the Gentiles could not
surpass the abundance of my host, but, “the Lord,” he saith, “hath upheld me.” The perse-
cution of the Gentiles succeeded not in pushing forward, to its overthrow, the host of the
faithful dwelling together in the unity of the faith.
8. “The Lord is my strength and my praise, and is become my salvation” (ver. 14). Who
then fall, when they are pushed, save they who choose to be their own strength and their
own praise? For no man falleth in the contest, except he whose strength and praise faileth.
He therefore whose strength and praise is the Lord, falleth no more than the Lord falleth.
And for this reason He hath become their salvation; not that He hath become anything
which He was not before, but because they, when they believed on Him, became what they
were not before, and then He began to be salvation unto them when turned towards Him,
which He was not to them when turned away from Himself.
9. “The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous” (ver. 15); where they
who raged against their bodies thought there was the voice of sorrow and destruction. For
they did not know the inward joy of the saints in their future hope. Whence the Apostle
also saith, “As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;”5112 and again, “And not only so, but we glory
in tribulations also.”5113
10. “The right hand of the Lord hath brought mighty things to pass” (ver. 16). What
mighty things? saith he. “The right hand of the Lord,” he saith, “hath exalted me.” It is a
mighty thing to exalt the humble, to deify the mortal, to bring perfection out of infirmity,

glory from subjection, victory from suffering, to give help, to raise from trouble; that the
true salvation of God might be laid open to the afflicted, and the salvation of men might
remain of no avail to the persecutors. These are great things: but what art thou surprised
at? hear what he repeateth: “The right hand of the Lord hath brought mighty things to pass.”
11. “I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord” (ver. 17). But they, while
they were dealing havoc and death on every side, thought that the Church of Christ was
dying. Behold, he now declareth the works of the Lord. Everywhere Christ is the glory of
the blessed Martyrs. By being beaten He conquered those who struck Him; by being patient
of torments, the tormentors;5114 by loving, those who raged against Him.
12. Nevertheless, let him point out to us, why the body of Christ, the holy Church, the
people of adoption, suffered such indignities. “The Lord,” he saith, “hast chastened and
corrected me, but He hath not given me over unto death” (ver. 18). Let not then the boastful
wicked imagine that aught hath been permitted to their power: they would not have that
power, were it not given them from above. Oft doth the father of a family command his
sons to be corrected by the most worthless slaves; though he designeth the heritage for the
former, fetters for the latter. What is that heritage? Is it of gold, or silver, or jewels, or farms,
or pleasant estates? Consider how we enter into it: and learn what it is.
13. “Open me,” he saith, “the gates of righteousness” (ver 19). Behold, we have heard
of the gates. What is within? “That I may,” he saith, “go into them, and give thanks unto
the Lord.” This is the confession of praise full of wonder, “even unto the house of God, in
the voice of joy and confession of praise, among such as keep holiday:”5115 this is the ever-
lasting bliss of the righteous, whereby they are blessed who dwell in the Lord’s house,
praising Him for evermore.5116
14. But consider how the gates of righteousness are entered into. “These are the gates
of the Lord” he saith, “the righteous shall enter into them” (ver. 20). At least let no wicked
man enter there, that Jerusalem which receiveth not one uncircumcised, where it is said,
“Without are dogs.”5117 Be it enough, that in my long pilgrimage “I have had my habitation
among the tents of Kedar:”5118 I endured even unto the end the intercourse of the wicked,
but “these are the gates of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into them.”
15. “I will confess unto Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast heard me, and art become my sal-
vation” (ver. 21). How often is that confession proved to be one of praise, that doth not

point out wounds to the physician, but giveth thanks for the health it hath received. But the
Physician Himself is the Salvation.
16. But who is this whom we speak of? “The Stone which the builders rejected” (ver.
22); for “It hath become the head Stone of the corner” to “make in Himself of twain one
new man, so making peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body;”5119
circumcision, to wit, and uncircumcision.
17. “By the Lord was it made unto it” (ver. 23): that is, it is made into the head stone of
the corner by the Lord. For although He would not have become this, had He not suffered:
yet He became not this through those from whom He suffered. For they who were building,
refused Him: but in the edifice which the Lord was secretly raising, that was made the head
stone of the corner which they rejected. “And it is marvellous in our eyes:” in the eyes of
the inner man, in the eyes of those that believe, those that hope, those that love; not in the
carnal eyes of those who, through scorning Him as if He were a man, rejected Him.
18. “This is the day which the Lord hath made” (ver. 24). This man remembereth that
he had said in former Psalms, “Since He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call
upon Him as long as I live;”5120 making mention of his old days; whence he now saith, “This
is the day which the Lord hath made;” that is, wherein He hath given me Salvation. This is
the day whereof He said, “In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of Salvation
have I helped thee;”5121 that is, a day wherein He, the Mediator, hath become the head Stone
of the corner. “Let us rejoice,” therefore, “and be glad in Him.”
19. “Save me now, O Lord: prosper Thou well my way, O Lord” (ver. 25). Because it is
the day of Salvation, “save me:” because we, returning from a long pilgrimage, are separated
from those who hated peace, with whom we were peaceful, and who, when we spoke to
them, made war upon us without a cause; “prosper well our way” as we return, since Thou
hast become our Way.
20. “Blessed be He that cometh in the Name of the Lord” (ver. 26). Cursed, therefore,
is he that cometh in his own name; as He saith in the Gospel: “if another shall come in his
own name, him ye will receive.”5122 “We have blessed you out of the house of God.” I believe
that these are the words of the great to the little, of those great ones, to wit, who in spirit
commune with God the Word, who is with God, as they may in this life; and yet temper
their discourse for the sake of the little ones, so that they may sincerely say what the Apostle
saith: “For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your
cause. For the love of Christ constraineth us.”5123 They bless the little children from the

Psalm CXVIII
inner house of the Lord, where that praise faileth not age after age: consider therefore what
they proclaim from thence.5124
21. “God is the Lord, who hath showed us light” (ver. 27). That Lord, who came in the
Lord’s Name, whom the builders refused, and who became the head Stone of the corner,5125
that “Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ,”5126 is God, He is equal with the Father,
He hath showed us light, that we might understand what we believed, and declare it to you
who understand it not as yet, but already believe it. But that ye also may understand, “Declare
a holy day in full assemblies, even unto the horns of the altar;” that is, even unto the inner
house of God, from which we have blessed you, where are the high places of the altar. “Declare
a holy day,” not in a slothful manner, but “in full assemblies” (ver. 28). For this is the voice
of joyfulness among those that keep holy day, who walk “in the place of the wonderful tab-
ernacle, even unto the house of God.”5127 For if there be there the spiritual sacrifice, the
everlasting sacrifice of praise, both the Priest is everlasting, and the peaceful mind of the
righteous an everlasting altar.…
22. And what shall we sing there, save His praises? What else shall we say there, save,
“Thou art my God, and I will confess unto Thee; Thou art my God, and I will praise Thee.
I wilt confess unto Thee, for Thou hast heard me, and art become my Salvation.” We will
not say these things in loud words; but the love that abideth in Him of itself crieth out in
these words, and these words are love itself. Thus as he began with praise, so he endeth:
“Confess unto the Lord, for He is gracious, and His mercy endureth for ever” (ver. 29). With
this the Psalm commenceth, with this it endeth; since, as from the commencement which
we have left behind, so in the end, whither we are returning, there is not anything that can
more profitably please us, than the praise of God, and Allelujah evermore.

Aleph.
1. From its commencement, dearly beloved, doth this great Psalm exhort us unto bliss,
which there is no one who desireth not.…And therefore this is the lesson which he teacheth,
who saith, “Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord”
(ver. 1). As much as to say, I know what thou wishest, thou art seeking bliss: if then thou
wouldest be blessed, be undefiled. For the former all desire, the latter fear: yet without it
what all wish cannot be attained. But where will any one be undefiled, save in the way? In
what way, save in the law of the Lord?…
2. Listen now to what he addeth: “Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, and seek
Him with their whole heart” (ver. 2). No other class of the blessed seemeth to me to be
mentioned in these words, than that which has been already spoken of. For to examine into
the testimonies of the Lord, and to seek Him with all the heart, this is to be undefiled in the
way, this is to walk in the law of the Lord. He then goeth on to say, “For they who do
wickedness, shall not walk in His ways” (ver. 3). And yet we know that the workers of
wickedness do search the testimonies of the Lord for this reason, that they prefer being
learned to being righteous: we know that others also search the testimonies of the Lord, not
because they are already living well, but that they may know how they ought to live. Such
5128 Lat. CXVIII. [The author says: “Preface.—I have expounded all the rest of the Psalms, which we know
the Book of the Psalms containeth, which by the custom of the Church is styled the Psalter, partly by preaching
among the people, partly by dictations, as well as I, by the Lord’s help, was able: but I put off the CXIXth Psalm,
as well on account of its well-known length, as on account of its depth being fathomable by few. And when my
brethren deeply regretted that the exposition of this Psalm alone, so far as pertaineth to the Psalms of the same
volume, was wanting to my works, and strongly pressed me to pay this debt, I yielded not to them, though they
long entreated and solicited me; because as often as I began to reflect upon it, it always exceeded the utmost
stretch of my powers. For in proportion as it seemeth more open, so much the more deep doth it appear to me;
so that I cannot show how deep it is. For in others, which are understood with difficulty, although the sense lie
hid in obscurity, yet the obscurity itself appeareth; but in this, not even this is the case; since it is superficially
such, that it seemeth not to need an expositor, but only a reader and listener. And now that at length I approach
its interpretation, I am utterly ignorant what I can achieve in it: nevertheless, I hope that God will aid me with
His Presence, that I may effect something. For thus He hath done in all those which, though at first they seemed
to me difficult, and almost impracticable, I have succeeded in adequately expounding. But I decided to do this
by means of sermons, which might be delivered among the people, such as the Greeks term ὁμιλίαι. For this is,
I think, more equitable, that the assemblies of the Church be not defrauded of the comprehension of this Psalm,
by the singing of which, as much as by that of others, they are wont to be charmed. But let the preface end here:
we must now speak of the Psalm itself, to which we have thought it right to make this Preface.”—C.]

then do not as yet walk undefiled in the law of the Lord, and for this reason are not as yet
blessed.…
3. It is written, and is read, and is true, in this Psalm, that “They who do wickedness,
walk not in His ways” (ver. 3). But we must endeavour, with the help of God, “in” whose
“hand are both we and our words,”5129 that what is rightly said, by not being rightly under-
stood, may not confuse the reader or hearer. For we must beware, lest all the Saints, whose
words these are, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us;”5130 may either not be thought to walk in the ways of the Lord, since sin is wickedness,
and “they who do wickedness, walk not in His ways;” or, because it is not doubtful that they
walk in the ways of the Lord, may be thought to have no sin, which is beyond doubt false.
For it is not said merely for the sake of avoiding arrogance and pride. Otherwise it would
not be added, “And the truth is not in us;” but it would be said, Humility is not in us: espe-
cially because the following words throw a clearer light on the meaning, and remove all the
causes of doubt. For when the blessed John had said this, he added, “If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteous-
ness.”5131…
4. What meaneth, “Thou hast charged that we shall keep Thy commandments too
much”? (ver. 4). Is it, “Thou hast charged too much”? or, “to keep too much”? Whichever
of these we understand, the sense seems contrary to that memorable and noble sentiment
which the Greeks praise in their wise men, and which the Latins agree in praising. “Do
nothing too much.”5132…But the Latin language sometimes uses the word nimis in such a
sense, that we find it in the holy Scripture, and employ it in our discourses, as signifying,
very much. In this passage, “Thou hast charged that we keep Thy commandments too much,”
we simply understand very much, if we understand rightly; and if we say to any very dear
friend, I love you too much, we do not wish to be understood to mean more than is fitting,
but very much.
5. “O that,” he saith, “my ways were made so direct, that I might keep Thy statutes” (ver.
5). Thou indeed hast charged: O that I could realize what thou hast charged. When thou
hearest, “O that,” recognise the words of one wishing; and having recognised the expression
of a wish, lay aside the pride of presumption. For who saith that he desireth what he hath

read: for there, ˆγαν is used, which is nimis; but here σφόδρα, which is equivalent to valdè, very much. But
sometimes, as we have said, we find nimis used, and use it ourselves, for what means valdè.”—The Author.
Aleph.
in such a manner in his power, that without need of any help he can do it? Therefore if man
desireth what God chargeth, God must be prayed to grant Himself what He enjoineth.…
6. “So shall I not be confounded, while I have respect unto all Thy commandments”
(ver. 6). We ought to look upon the commandments of God, whether when they are read,
or when they are recalled to memory, as a looking-glass, as the Apostle James saith.5133 This
man wisheth himself to be such, that he may regard as in a mirror the commandments of
God, and may not be confounded; because he chooses not merely to be a hearer of them,
but a doer. On this account he desireth that his ways may be made direct to keep the statutes
of God. How to be made direct, save by the grace of God? Otherwise he will find in the law
of God not a source of rejoicing, but of confusion, if he hath chosen to look into command-
ments, which he doth not.
7. “I will confess unto Thee,” he saith, “O Lord, in the directing of my heart; in that I
shall have learned the judgments of Thy righteousness” (ver. 7). This is not the confession
of sins, but of praise; as He also saith in whom there was no sin, “I will confess unto Thee,
O Father, Lord of heaven and earth;”5134 and as it is written in the Book of Ecclesiasticus,
“Thus shalt thou say in confession, of all the works of God, that they are very good.”5135 “I
will confess unto Thee,” he saith, “in the directing of my heart.” Indeed, if my ways are made
straight, I will confess unto Thee, since Thou hast done it, and this is Thy praise, and not
mine.…
8. Next he addeth: “I will keep Thy ordinances” (ver. 8).…But what is it that followeth?
“O forsake me not even exceedingly!” or, as some copies have it, “even too much,” instead
of, “even exceedingly.”5136 But since God had left the world to the desert of sins, He would
have forsaken it “even exceedingly,” if so powerful a cure had not supported it, that is, the
grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ; but now, according to this prayer of the body
of Christ, He forsook it not “even exceedingly;” for, “God was in Christ, reconciling the
world unto Himself.”5137…

9. “Wherewithal shall a young man correct his way? even by keeping Thy words” (ver.
9). He questioneth himself, and answereth himself. “Wherewithal?” So far it is a question:
next cometh the answer, “even by keeping Thy words.” But in this place the keeping of the
words of God, must be understood as the obeying His commandments in deed: for they are
kept in memory in vain, if they are not kept in life also. But what is meant by “young man”
here? For he might have said, wherewithal shall any one (homo) correct his way? or,
wherewithal shall a man (vir) correct his way? which is usually put by the Scriptures in such
a way, that the whole human race is understood.…But in this passage he saith neither any
one, nor a man, but, “a young man.” Is then an old man to be despaired of? or doth an old
man correct his way by any other means than by ruling himself after God’s word? Or is it
perhaps an admonition at what age we ought chiefly to correct our way; according to what
is elsewhere written, “My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wis-
dom till thy gray hairs.”5138 There is another mode of interpreting it, by recognising in the
expression the younger son in the Gospel,5139 who returned to himself, and said, “I will
arise and go to my father.”5140 Wherewithal did he correct his way, save by ruling himself
after the words of God, which he desired as one longing for his father’s bread.…
10. “With my whole heart,” he saith, “have I sought thee; O repel me not from Thy
commandments” (ver. 10). Behold, he prayeth that he may be aided to keep the words of
God, wherewith he had said that the young man corrected his way. For this is the meaning
of the words, “O repel me not from Thy commandments:” for what is it to be repelled of
God, save not to be aided? For human infirmity is not equal to obeying His righteous and
exalted commandments, unless His love doth prevent and aid. But those whom He aideth
not, these He is justly said to repel.…
11. “Thy words have I hid within my heart, that I may not sin against Thee” (ver. 11).
He at once sought the Divine aid, lest the words of God might be hidden without fruit in
his heart, unless works of righteousness followed. For after saying this, he added, “Blessed
art Thou, O Lord, teach me Thy righteousnesses” (ver. 12). “Teach me,” he saith, as they
learn who do them; not as they who merely remember them, that they may have somewhat
to speak of. Why then doth he say, “Teach me Thy righteousnesses,” save because he wisheth
to learn them by deeds, not by speaking or retaining them in his memory? Since then, as it
is read in another Psalm, “He shall give blessing, who gave the law;”5141 therefore, “Blessed
art Thou, O Lord,” he saith, “O teach me Thy righteousness.” For because I have hidden

Thy words in my heart, that I may not sin against Thee, Thou hast given a law; give also the

manded.…
12. “With my lips have I been telling of all the judgments of Thy mouth” (ver. 13); that
is, I have kept silent nothing of Thy judgments, which Thou didst will should become known
to me through Thy words, but I have been telling of all of them without exception with my
lips. This he seemeth to me to signify, since he saith not, all Thy judgments, but, “all the
judgments of Thy mouth;” that is, which Thou hast revealed unto me: that by His mouth
we may understand His word, which He hath discovered unto us in many revelations of the
Saints, and in the two Testaments; all which judgments the Church ceaseth not to declare
at all times with her lips.
13. “I have had as great delight in the way Thy testimonies, as in all manner of riches”
(ver. 14). We understand that there is no more speedy, no more sure, no shorter, no higher
way of the testimonies of God than Christ, “in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge.”5142 Thence he saith that he hath had as great delight in this way, as in all
riches. Those are the testimonies, by which He deigneth to prove unto us how much He
loveth us.5143…
14. “I will talk of Thy commandments, and have respect unto Thy ways”5144 (ver. 15).
And thus the Church doth exercise herself in the commandments of God, by speaking in
the copious disputations of the learned against all the enemies of the Christian and Catholic
faith; which are fruitful to those who compose them, if nothing but the ways of the Lord is
regarded in them; but “All the ways of the Lord are,” as it is written, “mercy and truth;”5145
the fulness of which both is found in Christ. Through this sweet exercise is gained also what
he subjoineth: “My meditation shall be in Thy statutes, and I will not forget Thy word” (ver.
16). “My meditation” shall be therein, that I may not forget them. Thus the blessed man in
the first Psalm “shall meditate in the law” of the Lord “day and night.”5146…

thing, in a manner, is made up of both, so that talking is not foreign to this sort of exercise.”—C.]

saith, “Reward Thy servant.” For there are four modes of reward: either evil for evil, as God
will reward everlasting fire to the unrighteous; or good for good, as He will reward an
everlasting kingdom to the righteous; or good for evil, as Christ by grace justifieth the un-
godly; or evil for good, as Judas and the Jews through their wickedness persecuted Christ.
Of these four modes of reward, the first two belong to justice, whereby evil is rewarded for
evil, good for good; the third to mercy, whereby good is rewarded for evil; the fourth God
knoweth not, for to none doth He reward evil for good. But that which I have placed third
in order, is in the first instance necessary: for unless God rewarded good for evil, there would
be none to whom He could reward good for good.…
16. Nowhere then let human pride raise itself up: God giveth good rewards unto His
own gifts.…
17. “Open Thou mine eyes, and I will consider wondrous things of Thy law” (ver. 18).
What he addeth, “I am a lodger upon earth” (ver. 19): or, as some copies read, “I am a so-
journer upon earth, O hide not Thy commandments from me,” hath the same meaning.…
18. Here an important question ariseth respecting the soul. For the words, I am a so-
journer, or lodger, or stranger upon earth,5147 cannot seem to have been said in reference
to the body, since the body derives its origin from the earth. But in this most profound
question I dare not define anything. For if it might justly have been said in respect of the
soul (which God forbid we should suppose derived from the earth), “I am a lodger,” or
“stranger upon earth;” or in reference to the whole man, since he was at one time an inhab-
itant of Paradise, where he who spake these words was not; or, what is more free from all
controversy, if it be not every man who could say this, but one to whom an everlasting
country hath been promised in heaven: this I know, “that the life of man on earth is a
temptation;”5148 and that “there is a heavy yoke upon the sons of Adam.”5149 But it pleaseth
me more to discuss the question in accordance with this construction, that we say we are
tenants or strangers upon earth, because we have found our country above, whence we have
received a pledge, and where when we have arrived we shall never depart.5150…
5147 [He says: “The Greek word π€ροικοςis variously rendered by our translators, incola, inquilinus, or advena.
Lodgers (inquilini) who have no house of their own, dwell in another man’s; but sojourners (incolæ), or strangers
(advenæ), are spoken of as foreigners (adventitii).”—C.]

19. Those whose conversation5151 is in heaven, as far as they abide here conversant, are
in truth strangers. Let them pray therefore that the commandments of God may not be
hidden from them, whereby they may be freed from this temporary sojourn, by loving God,
with whom they will be for evermore; and by loving their neighbour, that he may be there
where they also themselves will be.
20. But what is loved by loving, if love itself be not loved? Whence by consequence that
stranger upon earth, after praying that the commandments of God might not be hidden
from him, wherein love is enjoined either solely or principally; declareth that he desireth to
have a love for love itself, saying, “My soul hath coveted to have a desire alway after Thy
judgments” (ver. 20). This coveting is worthy of praise, not of condemnation.…
21. But he saith not, “coveteth,” only; but, “My soul hath coveted to desire Thy judg-
ments.” For there is no obstacle to possessing the judgments of God, save that they are not
desired, while love hath no warmth toward winning them, though their light is so clear and
shining.…
22. “Thou hast rebuked the proud: and cursed are they that do err from Thy command-
ments” (ver. 21). For the proud err from the commandments of God. For it is one thing not
to fulfil the commandments of God through infirmity or ignorance; another to err from
them through pride; as they have done, who have begotten us in our mortal state unto these
evils.…But consider now, after saying, “Thou hast rebuked the proud,” he saith not, Cursed
are they that have erred from Thy commandments; so that only that sin of the first men
should come into the mind; but he saith, “Cursed are they that do err.” For it was needful
that all might be terrified by that example, that they might not err from the divine command-
ments, and by loving righteousness in all time, recover in the toil of this world, what we lost
in the pleasure of Paradise.
23. “O turn from me shame and rebuke; for I have sought out Thy testimonies” (ver.
22). Testimonies are called in Greek μαρτύρια, which word we now use for the Latin word:
whence those who on account of their testimony to Christ have been brought low by various
sufferings, and have contended unto death for the truth, are not called testes, but by the
Greek term Martyrs. 5152 Since then ye hear in this term one more familiar and grateful, let
us take these words as if it were said, “O turn from me shame and rebuke; because I have
sought out Thy martyrdoms.” When the body of Christ speaketh thus, doth it consider it
any punishment to hear rebuke and shame from the ungodly and the proud, since it rather
reacheth the crown by this means? Why then doth it pray that it should be removed from
it as something heavy and insupportable, save because, as I said, it prayeth for its very en-
emies, to whom it seeth it is destructive, to cast the holy name of Christ as a reproach to
5151 Citizenship. Philip. iii. 19, 20.

Christians.…For my enemies, whom Thou enjoinest to be loved by me, who more and more
die and are lost, when they despise Thy martyrdoms and accuse them in me, will indeed be
recalled to life and be found, if they reverence Thy martyrdoms in me. Thus it hath happened:
this we see. Behold, martyrdom in the name of Christ, both with men and in this world, is
not only not a disgrace, but a great ornament: behold, not only in the sight of the Lord, but
in the sight of men, “precious is the death of His Saints;”5153 behold, His martyrs are not
only not despised, but honoured with great distinctions.…
24. “Princes also did sit and speak against me: but Thy servant is exercised in Thy stat-
utes” (ver. 23). Thou who desirest to know what sort of exercise this was, understand what
he hath added, “For Thy testimonies are my meditation, and Thy statutes are my counsellors”
(ver. 24). Remember what I have above instructed you, that testimonies are acts of martyr-
dom. Remember that among the statutes of the Lord there is none more difficult and more
worthy of admiration, than that every man should love his enemies.5154 Thus then the body
of Christ was exercised, so that it meditated on the acts of martyrdom that testified of Him,
and loved those from whom, while they rebuked and despised the Church for these very
martyrdoms, she suffered persecutions.…

25. “My soul cleaveth to the pavement: O quicken Thou me according to Thy word”
(ver. 25). What meaneth, “My soul cleaveth to the pavement, O quicken Thou me according
to Thy word”?…If we look upon the whole world as one great house, we see that the heavens
represent its vaulting, the earth therefore will be its pavement. He wisheth therefore to be
rescued from earthly things, and to say with the Apostle, “Our conversation5155 is in heaven.”
To cling therefore to earthly things is the soul’s death; the contrary of which evil, life is
prayed for, when he saith, “O quicken Thou me.”
26. …The body itself also, because it is of the earth, is reasonably understood by the
word pavement; since, because it is still corruptible and weigheth down the soul,5156 we
justly groan while in it, and say unto God, “O quicken Thou me.” For we shall not be without
our bodies when we shall be for evermore with the Lord;5157 but then because they will not
be corruptible, nor will they weigh down our souls, if we view it strictly, we shall not cleave
unto them, but they rather unto us, and we unto God.…
27. For what he was by himself, he confesseth in the following words: “I have acknow-
ledged my ways, and Thou heardest me” (ver. 26). Some copies indeed read, “Thy ways:”
but more, and the best Greek, read “my ways,” that is, evil ways. For he seemeth to me to
say this; I have confessed my sins, and Thou hast heard me; that is, so that Thou wouldest
remit them. “O teach me Thy statutes.” I have acknowledged my ways: Thou hast blotted
them out: teach me Thine. So teach me, that I may act; not merely that I may know how I
ought to act. For as it is said of the Lord, that He knew not sin,5158 and it is understood,
that He did no sin; so also he ought truly to be said to know righteousness, who doeth it.
This is the prayer of one who is improving.…
28. Finally he addeth, “Intimate to me the way of Thy righteousness” (ver. 27); or, as
some copies have it, “instruct me;” which is expressed more closely from the Greek, “Make
me to understand the way of Thy righteousnesses; so shall I be exercised in Thy wondrous
things.” These higher commandments, which he desireth to understand by edification, he
calleth the wondrous things of God. There are then some righteousnesses of God so won-
drous, that human weakness may be believed incapable of fulfilling them by those who have
not tried. Whence the Psalmist, struggling and wearied with the difficulty of obeying them,
saith, “My soul hath slumbered for very heaviness: O stablish Thou me with Thy word!”
(ver. 28). What meaneth, hath slumbered? save that he hath cooled in the hope which he
had entertained of being able to reach them. But, he addeth, “Stablish Thou me with Thy
5155 Citizenship. Philip. iii. 20.

word:” that I may not by slumbering fall away from those duties which I feel that I have
already attained: stablish Thou me therefore in those words of Thine that I already hold,
that I may be able to reach unto others through edification.
29. “Take Thou from me the way of iniquity” (ver. 29). And since the law of works hath
entered in, that sin might abound;5159 he addeth, “And pity me according to Thy law.” By
what law, save by the law of faith? Hear the Apostle: “Where is boasting then? It is excluded.
By what law? Of works. Nay: but by the law of faith.”5160 This is the law of faith, whereby
we believe and pray that it may be granted us through grace; that we may effect that which
we cannot fulfil through ourselves; that we may not, ignorant of God’s righteousness, and
going about to stablish our own, fail to submit ourselves unto the righteousness of God.5161
30. But after he had said, “And pity me according to Thy law;” he mentioneth some of
those blessings which he hath already obtained, that he may ask others that he hath not yet
gained. For he saith, “I have chosen the way of truth: and Thy judgments I have not forgotten”
(ver. 30). “I have stuck unto Thy testimonies: O Lord, confound me not” (ver. 31): may I
persevere in striving toward the point whereunto I am running: may I arrive whither I am
running! So then “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.”5162 He next saith, “I will run the way of Thy commandments, when Thou
hast widened my heart” (ver. 32). I could not run hadst Thou not widened my heart. The
sense of the words, “I have chosen the way of truth, and Thy judgments I have not forgotten:
I have stuck unto Thy testimonies,” is clearly explained in this verse. For this running is
along the way of the commandments of God. And because he doth allege unto the Lord
rather His blessings than his own deservings; as if it were said unto him, How hast thou run
that way, by choosing, and by not forgetting the judgments of God, and by sticking to His
testimonies? Couldest thou do these things by thyself? I could not, he replieth. It is not
therefore through my own will, as though it needed no aid of Thine; but because “Thou has
widened my heart.” The widening of the heart is the delight we take in righteousness. This
is the gift of God, the effect of which is, that we are not straitened in His commandments
through the fear of punishment, but widened through love, and the delight we have in
righteousness.…

31. In this great Psalm there cometh next in order that which, with the Lord’s help, we
must consider and treat of. “Set a law for me, O Lord, the way of Thy statutes, and I shall
seek it alway” (ver. 33).…
32. Why doth this man still pray for a law to be laid down for him; which, if it had not
been laid down for him, he could not have run the way of God’s commandments in the
breadth of his heart? But since one speaketh who is growing in grace, and who knoweth
that it is God’s gift that he profiteth in grace; what else doth he pray, when he prayeth that
a law may be laid down for him, save that he may profit more and more? As, if thou holdest
a full cup, and givest it to a thirsty man; he both exhausts it by drinking it, and prayeth for
it by still longing for it.…
33. But what meaneth, “Evermore”?…Doth “evermore” mean as long as we live here,
because we progress in grace so long; but after this life, he who was in a good course of im-
provement here, is made perfect there? Here the law of God is examined into, as long as we
progress in it, both by knowing it and by loving it: but there its fulness abideth for our en-
joyment, not for our examination. Thus also is this spoken, “Seek His face evermore.” 5163
Where, evermore, save here? For we shall not there also seek the face of God, when “we
shall see face to face.”5164 Or if that which is loved without a change of affection is rightly
said to be sought after, and our only object is, that it be not lost, we shall indeed evermore
seek the law of God, that is, the truth of God: for in this very Psalm it is said, “And Thy law
is the truth.”5165 It is now sought, that it may be held fast; it will then be held fast that it
may not be lost.…
34. “Give me understanding, and I shall search Thy law, yea, I shall keep it with my
whole heart” (ver. 34). For when each man hath searched the law, and searched its deep
things, in which its whole meaning doth consist; he ought indeed to love God with all his
heart, with all his soul, with all his mind; and his neighbour as himself. “For on these two
commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.” 5166 This he seemeth to have promised,
when he said, “Yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart.”
35. But since he hath no power to do even this, save he be aided by Him who commande-
th him to do what He commandeth, “Make me,” he addeth, “to go in the path of Thy com-
mandments, for therein is my desire” (ver. 35). My desire is powerless, unless Thou Thyself
makest me to go where I desire. And this is surely the very path, that is, the path of God’s
commandments, which he had already said that he had run, when his heart was enlarged

by the Lord. And this he calleth a “path,” because “the way is narrow which leadeth unto
life;”5167 and since it is narrow, we cannot run therein save with a heart enlarged.…
36. He next saith, “Incline mine heart unto Thy testimonies, and not to covetousness”
(ver. 36). This then he prayeth, that he may profit in the will itself.5168…But the Apostle
saith, “Avarice is a root of all evils.”5169 But in the Greek, whence these words have been
rendered into our tongue, the word used by the Apostle is not πλεονεξία, which occurs in
this passage of the Psalms; but φιλαργυρία, by which is signified “love of money.” But the
Apostle must be understood to have meant genus by species when he used this word, that
is, to have meant avarice universally and generally by love of money, which is truly the root
of all evils.5170…If therefore our heart be not inclined to covetousness, we fear God only
for God’s sake, so that He is the only reward of our serving Him. Let us love Him in Himself,
let us love Him in ourselves, Him in our neighbours whom we love as ourselves, whether
they have Him, or in order that they may have Him.…
37. The next words in the Psalm which we have undertaken to expound are, “O turn
away mine eyes, lest they behold vanity: and quicken Thou me in Thy way” (ver. 37). Vanity
and truth are directly contrary to one another. The desires of this world are vanity: but
Christ, who freeth us from the world, is truth. He is the way, too, wherein this man wisheth
to be quickened, for He is also the life: “I am the way, the truth, and the life,”5171 are His
own words.
38. …He prayeth that those eyes wherewith we consider on what account we do what
we do, may be turned away that they behold not vanity; that is, that he may not look to
vanity, as his motive, when he doeth anything good. In this vanity the first place is held by
the love of men’s praise, on account of which many great deeds have been wrought by those
who are styled great in this world, and who have been much praised in heathen states,
seeking glory not with God, but among men, and on account of this living in appearance
prudently, courageously, temperately, and righteously; and when they have reached this
they have reached their reward: vain men, and vain reward.5172…Moreover, if it be a vain

whereby every man seeketh more than is enough: for the word πλ™ον meaneth more, and Ÿξις signifieth having,
being derived from the verb to have. It is therefore termed πλεονεξια, from having too much: a word which the
Latin translators in this passage have variously rendered by emolument, utility, and avarice, which last is
best.”—C.]

thing to do good works for the sake of men’s praises, how much more vain for the sake of
getting money, or increasing it, or retaining it, and any other temporal advantage, which
cometh unto us from without? Since “all things are vanity: what is man’s abundance, with
all his toil, wherein he laboureth under the sun?”5173 For our temporal welfare itself finally
we ought not to do our good works, but rather for the sake of that everlasting welfare which
we hope for, where we may enjoy an unchangeable good, which we shall have from God,
nay, what God Himself is unto us. For if God’s Saints were to do good works for the sake
of this temporal welfare, never would the martyrs of Christ achieve a good work of confession
in the loss of this same welfare.…
39. “O stablish Thy word in Thy servant, that I may fear Thee” (ver. 38). And what else
is this than, Grant unto me that I may do according to what Thou sayest? For the word of
God is not stablished in those who remove it in themselves by acting contrary to it; but it is
stablished in those in whom it is immoveable. God therefore stablisheth His word, that they
may fear Him, in those unto whom He giveth the spirit of the fear of Him; not that fear of
which the Apostle saith, “Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;”5174 for
“perfect love casteth out” this “fear,”5175 but that fear which the Prophet calleth “the spirit
of the fear of the Lord;”5176 that fear which “is pure, and endureth for ever;”5177 that fear
which feareth to offend Him whom it loveth.
40. “Take away my reproach which I have suspected, for Thy judgments are sweet” (ver.
39). Who is he who suspected his own reproach, and who doth not know his own reproach
better than that of his neighbour? For a man may rather suspect another’s than his own;
since he knoweth not that which he suspecteth; but in each one’s own reproach there is not
suspicion for him, but knowledge, wherein conscience speaketh. What then mean the words,
“the rebuke which I have suspected”? The meaning of them must be derived from the former
verse; since as long as a man doth not turn away his eyes lest they behold vanity, he suspec-
teth in others what is going on in himself; so that he believeth another to worship God, or
do good works, from the same motive as himself. For men can see what we do, but with a
view to what end we act, is hidden.…
41. “Behold, I have coveted Thy commandments: O quicken Thou me in Thy righteous-
ness” (ver. 40). Behold, I have coveted to love Thee with all my heart, and with all my soul,
and with all my mind, and my neighbour as myself, but, “O quicken Thou me” not in my
own, but “in Thy righteousness,” that is, fill me with that love which I have longed for. Aid

God is made unto us wisdom,” etc.5178 And in Him I find Thy commandments, which I
have coveted, that in Thy righteousness, that is, in Him, Thou mayest quicken me. For the
Word Himself is God; and “the Word was made flesh,”5179 that He Himself also might be

42. “And let Thy loving mercy come also unto us, O Lord” (ver. 41). This sentence seems
annexed to the foregoing: for he doth not say, Let it come unto me, but, “And let it come
unto me.”…What then doth he here pray for, save that through His loving mercy who
commanded, he may perform the commandments which he hath coveted? For he explaineth
in some degree what he meant by adding, “even Thy salvation, according to Thy word:”
that is, according to Thy promise. Whence the Apostle desireth us to be understood as the
children of promise:5180 that we may not imagine that what we are is our own work, but
refer the whole to the grace of God.…Christ Himself is the Salvation of God, so that the
whole body of Christ may say, “By the grace of God I am what I am.”5181
43. “And so shall I make answer,” he saith, “to them that reproach me with the word”
(ver. 42). It is doubtful whether it be “reproach me with a word;” or, “I will answer with a
word;” but either signifieth Christ. They to whom Christ crucified is a stumbling-block or
foolishness,5182 reproach us with Him; ignorant that “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
in us;”5183 the Word which “was in the beginning,” and “was with God, and was God.”5184
But although they may not reproach us with the Word which is unknown unto them, because
His Divinity is not known unto those by whom His weakness on the Cross is despised; let
us nevertheless make answer of the Word, and let us not be terrified or confounded by their
reproaches. For “if they had known” the Word, “they would never have crucified the Lord
of glory.”5185…Therefore, when the Psalmist had said, “I will make answer unto them that
reproach me with the word:” he at once addeth, “For my trust is in Thy words,” which
meaneth exactly, in Thy promises.
44. “O take not the word of Thy truth away out of my mouth even exceedingly” (ver.
43). He saith, out of my mouth, because the unity of the body is speaking, among whose
members those also are counted who failed at the hour by denying, but by penitence after-
wards came again to life, or even, by renewing their confession, received the palm of mar-
tyrdom, which they had lost. The word of truth, therefore, was not “even exceedingly,” or,
as some copies have it, even every way, that is not altogether taken from the mouth of Peter,
in whom was the type of the Church; because although he denied for the hour, being dis-
turbed with fear, yet by weeping he was restored,5186 and by confessing was afterwards

crowned. The whole body of Christ therefore speaketh.…Next followeth, “for I have hoped
in Thy judgments.” Or, as some have more strictly rendered it from the Greek, “I have hoped
more;”5187 a word which, although compounded in a somewhat unusual way, yet answers
the necessary purpose of conveying the truth in a translation.…Behold the saints and the
humble in heart when they have trusted in Thee, have not failed in persecutions: behold
also those who from trusting in themselves have failed, and nevertheless have belonged to
the Very Body, have wept when they became known unto themselves, and have found Thy
grace a more solid support, because they have lost their own pride.
45. “So shall I alway keep Thy law” (ver. 44): that is, if Thou wilt not take the word of
Thy truth out of my mouth. “Yea, unto age, and age of age:” he showeth what he meant by
“alway.” For sometimes by “alway” is meant, as long as we live here; but this is not, “unto
age, and age of age.”5188 For it is better thus translated than as some copies have, “to eternity,
and to age of age,” since they could not say, and to eternity of eternity. That law therefore
should be understood, of which the Apostle saith, “Love is the fulfilling of the law.”5189 For
this will be kept by the saints, from whose mouth the word of truth is not taken, that is, by
the Church of Christ Herself, not only during this world, that is, until this world is ended;
but for another also which is styled, “world without end.”5190…
46. “And I walked at liberty: for I sought Thy precepts” (ver. 45).…“And I walked at
liberty.” Here the copulative conjunction, “and,” is not used as a connecting particle; for he
doth not say, and I will walk, as he had said, “and I will keep Thy commandments for ever
and ever:” or if this latter verse be in the optative mood, and may I keep Thy law; he doth
not add, And may I walk at liberty, as if he had desired and prayed for both of these things;
but he saith, “And I walked at liberty.” If this conjunction were not used here, and if the
sentence were introduced free from any such connection with what preceded, “I walked at
liberty,” the reader would never be induced by anything unusual in the mode of speech to
think he should seek for some hidden sense. Doubtless, then, he wished what he hath not
said to be understood, that is, that his prayers had been heard; and he then added what he
had become: as if he were to say, When I prayed for these things, Thou heardest me, “And
I walked at liberty;” and so with the remaining expressions which he hath added to the same
purpose.
47. …Whence after he had said, “And I walked at liberty,” he subjoined the reason, “For
I sought out Thy commandments.” Some copies have not “commandments” but “testimon-

hesitate rather to believe this tongue, as prior to our own,5191 and that from which these
Psalms have been rendered into Latin? If then we wish to know how he sought out these
commandments, or how they ought to be sought out, let us consider what our good Master,
who both taught and gave them, saith: “Ask, and it shall be given you.”5192 And a little lower,
“If ye then,” He saith, “being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how
much more shall your Father which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask Him.”5193
Where He evidently showeth, that the words He had spoken, seek, ask, knock, belong only
to earnestness in asking, that is, in praying. Moreover, another Evangelist saith not, He will
give good things to them that ask Him; which may be understood in many ways, either as
earthly or spiritual blessings; but has excluded other interpretations, and very carefully ex-
pressed what our Lord wished us to pray earnestly and instantly for, in these words: “How
much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.”5194…
48. “I spoke of Thy testimonies also,” he saith, “before kings, and I was not ashamed”
(ver. 46): as one who had sought and had received grace to answer those who reproached
him with the word, and the promise that the word of truth should not be taken from his
mouth. Struggling for this truth even unto death, not even before kings was he ashamed to
speak of it. For testimonies, whereof he doth avow that he was speaking, are in Greek styled
μαρτύρια, a word which we now employ instead of the Latin. The name of “Martyrs,” unto
whom Jesus foretold, that they should confess Him even before kings,5195 is derived hence.
49. “And I meditated,” he saith, “on Thy commandments, which I have loved” (ver. 47).
“My hands also have I lifted up unto Thy commandments, which I have loved” (ver. 48);
or, as some copies read, “which I have loved exceedingly,” or “too much,” or “vehemently,”
as they have chosen to render the Greek word σφόδρα. He then loved the commandments
of God because he walked at liberty; that is, through the Holy Spirit, through whom love
itself is shed abroad,5196 and enlargeth the hearts of the faithful. But he loved, both in thought
and in acts. With a view to thought, he saith, “And I meditated:” as to action, “My hands
also have I lifted up.” But to both sentences, he hath annexed the words, “which I have
loved:” for “the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart.”5197…The following
words, “And my study was in Thy statutes,” relate to both. This expression most of the

translators have preferred to this, “I rejoiced in,” or “I talked of,” a version which some have
given from the Greek ἠδολ™σχουν. For he who keepeth the commandments of God, which
he loveth, both in thought and in works taking delight in them, is exercised with joy, and
with a certain abundance of speech, in the judgments of God.

50. “O remember Thy word unto Thy servant, wherein Thou hast given me hope” (ver.
49). Is forgetfulness incident to God, as it is to man? Why then is it said unto Him, “O re-
member”? Although in other passages of holy Scripture this very word is used, as, “Why
hast Thou forgotten me?”5198 and, “Wherefore forgettest Thou our misery?”5199…These
expressions are borrowed from moral discourses on human affections; although God doth
these things according to a fixed dispensation, with no failing memory, nor with an under-
standing obscured, nor with a will changed. When therefore it is said unto Him, “O remem-
ber,” the desire of him who prayeth is displayed, because he asketh for what was promised;
God is not admonished, as if the promise had escaped from His mind. “O remember,” he
saith, “Thy word unto Thy servant:” that is, fulfil Thy promise to Thy servant. “Wherein
Thou hast given me hope:” that is, in Thy Word, since Thou hast promised, Thou hast
caused me to hope.
51. “The same is my comfort in my humiliation” (ver. 50). Namely, that hope which is
given to the humble, as the Scripture saith: “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto
the humble.”5200 Whence also our Lord Himself saith with His own lips, “For whosoever
exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.”5201 We well
understand here that humiliation also, not whereby each man humbleth himself by confessing
his sins, and by not arrogating righteousness to himself; but when each man is humbled by
some tribulation or mortification which his pride deserved; or when he is exercised and
proved by endurance;5202 whence a little after this Psalm saith, “Before I was troubled, I
went wrong.”…And the Lord Jesus, when He foretold that this humiliation would be brought
upon His disciples by their persecutors, did not leave them without a hope; but gave them
one, whereby they might find comfort, in these words: “In your patience shall ye possess
your souls;” and declared even of their very bodies, which might be put to death by their
enemies, and seemingly be utterly annihilated, that not a hair of their heads should perish.5203
This hope was given to Christ’s Body, that is, to the Church, that it might be a comfort to
Her in her humiliation.…This hope He gave in the prayer which He taught us, where He
enjoined us to say, “Lead us not into temptation:”5204 for He in a manner implicitly promised
that He would give to His disciples in their danger that which He taught them to ask for in

their prayers. And indeed this Psalm is rather to be understood to speak of this hope: “For
Thy word hath quickened me.” Which they have rendered more closely who have put not
“word,” but “utterance.” For the Greek has λόγιον, which is “utterance;” not λόγος, which
is “word.”
52. The next verse is, “The proud dealt exceeding wickedly: yet have I not shrinked from
Thy law” (ver. 51). By the proud he wished to be understood the persecutors of the pious;
and he therefore added, “yet have I not shrinked from Thy laws,” because the persecution
of the proud attempted to force him to do this. He saith that they dealt “exceeding wickedly,”
because they were not only wicked themselves, but even tried to make the godly wicked. In
this humiliation, that is, in this tribulation, that hope comforted him which was given in
the word of God, who promised aid, that the faith of the Martyrs might not faint; and who
by the presence of His Spirit gave strength to them in their toils, that they might escape from
the snare of the fowlers.5205…
53. “For I was mindful of Thy judgments from the beginning of the world, O Lord, and
received comfort” (ver. 52); or, as other copies have it, “and I was exhorted,” that is, received
exhortation. For either might be rendered for the Greek pareklhqhn. “From the beginning
of the world,” that is, from the birth of the human race, “I was mindful of Thy judgments”
upon the vessels of wrath, which are fitted unto perdition: “and I received comfort,” since
through these also hast Thou shown the riches of Thy glory on the vessels of Thy mercy.5206
54. “Weariness hath held me; for the ungodly that forsake Thy law” (ver. 53). “Thy
statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage” (ver. 54). This is the low estate,
in the house of mortality, of the man who sojourneth away from Paradise and the Jerusalem
above, whence one going down to Jericho fell among robbers; but, in consequence of the
deed of mercy which was done him by that Samaritan,5207 the statutes of God became his
song in the house of his pilgrimage; although he was weary for the ungodly that forsook the
law of God, since he was compelled to converse with them for a season in this life, until the
floor be threshed. But these two verses may be adapted to the two clauses of the preceding
verse, respectively.
55. “I have thought upon Thy Name, O Lord, in the night-season, and have kept Thy
law” (ver. 55). Night is that low estate wherein is the trouble of mortality; night is in the
proud who deal exceeding wickedly; night is the fear for the ungodly who forsake the law
of the Lord; night is, lastly, the house of this pilgrimage, “until the Lord come, and bring to
light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and

then shall every man have praise of God.”5208 In this night, therefore, man ought to remember
the Name of the Lord; “So that he who glorieth, may glory in the Lord.”5209
56. Considering this, he addeth, “This was made unto me, because I sought out Thy
righteousnesses” (ver. 56). “Thy” righteousnesses, whereby Thou dost justify the ungodly;
not mine, which never make me godly, but proud. For this man was not one of those who,
“ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” 5210 Others have better in-
terpreted these righteousnesses, as those whereby men are justified for nought through
God’s grace, though by themselves they cannot be righteous, “justifications.”5211 But what
meaneth, “This was made unto me”? What is “This”? It is perhaps the law? as he had said,
“and I have kept Thy law;” to which he subjoins, “This was made unto me,” meaning, “This
was made my law.” We must therefore enquire first what was thus made unto him, next in
what manner, whatever it may have been, was made unto him. “This,” he saith, “was made
unto me:” not “This law,” for the Greek, as I have said, refuseth this sense. Perhaps then,
“This night:” since the preceding sentence stands thus: “I have thought upon Thy Name, O
Lord, in the night-season:” and the next words are, “This was made unto me:” since then it
is not the law, it must truly be the night which is thus spoken of. What then meaneth, “I
had the night-season: for I have sought out Thy righteousnesses”? Rather light had come
unto him than night, since he sought out the righteousnesses of God. And it is thus rightly
understood, “It was made unto me,” as if it were said, It became night for my sake, that is,
that it might profit me. For that low estate of mortality is not absurdly understood as night,
where the hearts of mortals are hid to one another, so that from such darkness innumerable
and heavy temptations arise.…

57. Let us hear what followeth: “I have promised to keep Thy law.” What meaneth, “My
portion, O Lord: I have promised to keep Thy law” (ver. 57); save because the Lord will be
each man’s portion then, when he hath kept His law? Consider therefore what he subjoineth:
“I entreated Thy face, with my whole heart:” and saying in what manner he prayed: “O be
merciful,” he saith, “unto me, according to Thy word” (ver. 58). And as if he had been heard
and aided by Him whom he prayed unto, “I thought,” he saith, “on mine own ways, and
turned away my feet unto Thy testimonies” (ver. 59). That is, I turned them away from mine
own ways, which displeased me, that they might follow Thy testimonies, and there might
find a path. For most of the copies have not, “Because I thought,” as is read in some; but
only, “I thought.” But what is here written, “and I turned away my feet:” some read, “Because
I thought, Thou also hast turned away my feet:” that this may rather be ascribed to the grace
of God, according to the Apostle’s words, “For it is God who worketh in us.”5212…
58. Lastly, when he had received this blessing of grace, he saith, “I was ready, and was
not disturbed, that I may keep Thy commandments” (ver. 60). Which some have rendered,
“to keeping Thy commandments,” some “that I should keep,” others “to keep,” the Greek
being τοῦ φυλ€ξασθαι.
59. But in what manner he was ready to keep the divine commandments, he hath added,
in these words: “The bands of the ungodly have surrounded me: but I have not forgotten
Thy law” (ver. 61). “The bands of the ungodly” are the hindrances of our enemies, whether
spiritual, as the devil and his angels, or carnal, the children of disobedience, in whom the
devil worketh.5213 For this word peccatorum is not from peccata, “sins;” but from peccatores,
“sinners.” Therefore when they threaten evils, with which to alarm the righteous, that they
may not suffer for the law of God, they, so to speak, entangle them with bands, with a strong
and tough cord of their own. For “they draw iniquity like a long rope,”5214 and thus endeav-
our to entangle the holy, and sometimes are allowed so to do.
60. “At midnight,” he saith, “I rise to give thanks unto Thee: because of Thy righteous
judgments” (ver. 62). This very fact, that the bands of the ungodly surround the righteous,
is one of the righteous judgments of God. On which account the Apostle Peter saith, “The
time is come when judgment must begin at the house of the Lord.”5215 For he saith this of
the persecutions which the Church suffered, when the bands of the ungodly surrounded
them. I suppose, therefore, that by “midnight” we should understand the heavier seasons
of tribulation. In which he said, “I arose:” since He did not so afflict him, as to cast him

down; but tried him, so that he arose, that is, that through this very tribulation he might
advance unto a bolder confession.
61. For I imagine that what followeth, “I am a companion of all them that fear Thee,
and keep Thy commandments” (ver. 63), doth relate to the Head Himself, as it is in the
Epistle which is inscribed to the Hebrews: “Both He that sanctifieth and they who are
sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not ashamed to call them
brethren.”5216…Therefore Jesus Himself speaketh in this prophecy: some things in His
Members and in the Unity of His Body, as if in one man diffused over the whole world, and
growing up in succession throughout the roll of ages: and some things in Himself our Head.
And on this account, that since He became the companion of His brethren, God of men,
the Immortal of the mortal, for this reason the seed fell upon the earth, that by its death it
might produce much fruit; he next addeth concerning this very fruit, “The earth, O Lord,
is full of Thy mercy” (ver. 64). And whence this, save when the ungodly is justified? That
we may make progress in the knowledge of this grace, he addeth, “O teach me Thy right-
eousnesses!”

62. “Thou hast dealt in sweetness with Thy servant: according unto Thy word;” or rather,
“according unto Thine utterance” (ver. 65). The Greek word χρηστότης hath been variously
rendered by our translators by the words “sweetness” and “goodness.” But since sweetness
may exist also in evil, since all unlawful and unclean things afford pleasure, and it may also
exist in that carnal pleasure which is permitted; we ought to understand the word “sweetness,”
which the Greeks termed χρηστότης, of spiritual blessings: for on this account our translators
have preferred to term it “goodness.” I think therefore that nothing else is meant by the
words, “Thou hast dealt in sweetness with Thy servant,” than this, Thou hast made me feel
delight in that which is good. For when that which is good delighteth, it is a great gift of
God. But when the good work which the law commandeth is done from a fear of punishment,
not from a delight in righteousness, when God is dreaded, not loved; it is the act of a slave,
not of a freeman.5217
63. “O learn me sweetness, and understanding, and knowledge,” he saith, “for I have
believed Thy commandments” (ver. 66). He prayeth these things may be increased and
perfected. For they who said, “Lord, increase our faith,”5218 had faith. And as long as we
live in this world, these are the words of those who are making progress. But he addeth,
“understanding,” or, as most copies read, “discipline.” Now the word discipline, for which
the Greeks use παιδεία, is employed in Scripture, where instruction through tribulation is
to be understood: according to the words, “Whom the Lord loveth He disciplineth, and
scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.” 5219 In the literature of the Church this is usually
called discipline. For this word, παιδεία,5220 is used in the Greek in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, where the Latin translator saith, “No disciplinefor the present seemeth to be joyous,
but grievous,” etc.5221 He therefore toward whom the Lord dealeth in sweetness, that is, he
in whom He mercifully inspires delight in that which is good, ought to pray instantly, that
this gift may be so increased unto him, that he may not only despise all other delights in
comparison with it, but also that he may endure any amount of sufferings for its sake. Thus
is discipline healthfully added to sweetness. This discipline ought not to be desired, and
prayed for, for a small measure of grace and goodness, that is, holy love; but for so great, as
may not be extinguished by the weight of the chastening:…so much in fact as to enable him
to endure with the utmost patience the discipline. In the third place is mentioned knowledge;

since, if knowledge in its greatness outstrips the increase of love, it doth not edify, but
“puffeth up.”5222…
64. But in that he saith, not, Give unto me; but, “O learn me;” how is the sweetness
taught, if it be not given? Since many know what doth not delight them, and find no sweetness
in things of which they have knowledge. For sweetness cannot be learnt, unless it please.
Also discipline, which signifieth the tribulation which chasteneth, is learnt by receiving; that
is, not by hearing, or reading, or thinking, but by feeling.…
65. He addeth, “for I have believed Thy commandments,” and herein we may justly
enquire, why he said not, I obeyed, rather than, I believed. For commandments are one
thing, promises another. We undertake to obey commandments, that we may deserve to
receive promises. We therefore believe promises, obey commandments.…Teach me therefore
sweetness by inspiring charity, teach me discipline by giving patience, teach me knowledge
by enlightening my understanding: “for I have believed Thy commandments.” I have believed
that Thou who art God, and who givest unto man whence Thou mayest cause him to do
what Thou commandest, hast commanded these things.
66. “Before I was humbled, I went wrong; wherefore I have kept Thy word” (ver. 67);
or, as some have it more closely, “Thy utterance,” that is, lest I should be humbled again.
This is better referred to that humiliation which took place in Adam, in whom the whole
human creature, as it were, being corrupted at the root, as it refused to be subject to truth,
“was made subject to vanity.” 5223 Which it was profitable to the vessels of mercy to feel,
that by throwing down pride, obedience might be loved, and misery perish, never again to
return.
67. “Sweet art Thou, O Lord;” or, as many have it, “Sweet art Thou, even Thou, O Lord”
(ver. 68). Some also, “Sweet art Thou,” or, “Good art Thou:” as we have before treated of
this word: “and in Thy sweetness teach me Thy statutes.” He truly desireth to do the right-
eousnesses of God, since he desireth to learn them in His sweetness from Him unto whom
he hath said, “Sweet art Thou, O Lord.”
68. Next he saith, “The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied upon me” (ver. 69):
of those, that is, whom it profited not that human nature was humbled after it went wrong.
“But I will search Thy commandments with my whole heart.” Howsoever, he saith, iniquity
shall abound, love shall not grow cold in me.5224 He, as it were, saith this, who in His
sweetness learneth the righteousnesses of God. For in proportion as the commandments of
Him who aideth us are the more sweet, so much the more doth he who loveth Him search

after them, that he may perform them when known, and may learn them by doing them;
because they are more perfectly understood when they are performed.
69. “Their heart is curdled as milk” (ver. 70). Whose, save the proud, whose iniquity he
hath said hath been multiplied upon him? But he wisheth it to be understood by this word,
and in this passage, that their heart hath become hard. It is used also in a good sense,5225
and is understood to mean, full of grace: for this word, some have also interpreted
“curdled.”…
70. “It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me: that I might learn Thy righteousnesses”
(ver. 71). He hath said something kindred to this above. For by the fruit itself he showeth
that it was a good thing for him to be humbled; but in the former passage he hath stated the
cause also, in that he had felt beforehand that humiliation which resulted from his punish-
ment, when he went wrong. But in these words, “Wherefore have I kept Thy word:” and
again in these, “That I might learn Thy righteousnesses:” he seemeth to me to have signified,
that to know these is the same thing as to keep them, to keep them the same thing as to
know them. For Christ knew what He reproved; and yet He reproved sin, though it is said
of Him that “He knew not sin.”5226 He knew therefore by a kind of knowledge, and again
He knew not by a kind of ignorance. Thus also many learn the righteousnesses of God, and
learn them not. For they know them in a certain way; and, again do not know them from a
kind of ignorance, since they do them not. In this sense the Psalmist therefore is to be un-
derstood to have said, “That I might learn Thy righteousnesses,” meaning that kind of
knowledge whereby they are performed.
71. But that this is not gained, save through love, wherein he who doeth them hath de-
light, on which account it is said, “In Thy sweetness teach me Thy righteousnesses:” the
following verse showeth, wherein he saith, “The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than
thousands of gold and silver” (ver. 72): so that love loveth the law of God more than avarice
loveth thousands of gold and silver.

72. …“Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me” (ver. 73). The hands of God are
the power of God. Or if the plural number moveth them, since it is not said, Thy hand, but,
“Thy hands;” let them understand by the hands of God the power and wisdom of God, both
of which titles are given to one Christ,5227 who is also understood under the figure, Arm of
the Lord.5228 Or let them understand by the hands of God, the Son and the Holy Spirit;
since the Holy Spirit worketh conjointly with the Father and the Son: whence saith the
Apostle, “But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit:”5229 he said, “one and the
self-same;” lest as many spirits as works might be imagined, not that the Spirit worketh
without the Father and the Son. It is easy therefore to see how the hands of God are to be
understood: provided, at the same time, that He be not denied to do those things through
His Word which He doth by His hands: nor be considered not to do those things with His
hands, which He doth through His word.…But is this said in respect of Adam? from whom
since all men were propagated, what man, since Adam was made, may not say that he
himself also was made by reason of procreation and generation from Adam? Or may it
rightly be said, in this sense, “Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me,” namely, that
every man is born even of his parents not without the work of God, God creating, they
generating? Since, if the creative5230 power of God be withdrawn from things, they perish:
nor is anything at all, either of the world’s elements, or of parents, or of seeds, produced, if
God doth not create it.…
73. The Greek version hath a more concise expression for our, “Give me understanding,”
συν™τισον με, expressing “give understanding” by the single word συν™τισον, which the
Latin cannot do; as if one could not say, Heal me; and it were necessary to say, Give me
health, as it is here said, “Give me understanding;” or, make me whole, as here it may be
said, make me intelligent. This indeed an Angel could do: for he said to Daniel, “I am come
to give thee understanding;”5231 and this word is in the Greek, as it is here also, συν™τισαί
σε; as if the Latin translator were to render θεραπεῦσαί σε by sanitatem dare tibi. For the
Latin interpreter would not make a circumlocution by saying, to give thee understanding,
if, as we say from health, “to heal thee,” so one could say from intellect, “to intellectuate
thee.” But if an Angel could do this, what reason is there that this man should pray that this
be done for him by God? Is it because God had commanded the Angel to do it? Just so: for
Christ is understood to have given this command to the Angel.5232…

74. “That I may learn Thy commandments.” Since Thou, saith he, hast formed me, do
Thou new form me; that that may be done in Christ’s Body, which the Apostle speaks of,
“Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”5233
75. “They that fear Thee,” he saith, “will see me, and be glad” (ver. 74): or, as other
copies have it, “will be joyful: because I have hoped in Thy word:” that is, in the things which
Thou hast promised, that they may be the sons of promise, the seed of Abraham, in whom
all nations are blessed.5234 Who are they who fear God, and whom will they see and be glad,
because he hath put his trust in the word of God? Whether it be the body of Christ, that is,
the Church, whose words these are through Christ, or within it, and concerning it, these
are as it were the words of Christ concerning Himself; are not they themselves among those
who fear God?…The same persons, who see the Church and are glad, are the Church. But
why said he not, They who fear Thee see me, and are glad: whereas he hath written, “fear
Thee,” in the present tense; while the verbs “shall see,” and shall “be glad,” are futures? Is it
because in the present state there is fear, as long as “man’s life is a temptation upon earth;”5235
but the gladness which he desired to be understood, will be then, when “the righteous shall
shine in the kingdom of their Father like the sun.”5236…
76. “I know,” she saith, “O Lord, that Thy judgments are righteous, and that in Thy
truth Thou hast humbled me” (ver. 75). “O let Thy merciful kindness be my comfort, ac-
cording to Thy word unto Thy servant” (ver. 76). Mercy and truth are so spoken of in the
Divine Word, that, while they are found in many passages, especially in the Psalms, it is also
so read in one place, “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth.”5237 And here indeed
he hath placed truth first, whereby we are humbled unto death, by the judgment of Him
whose judgments are righteousness: next mercy, whereby we are renewed unto life, by the
promise of Him whose blessing is His grace. For this reason he saith, “according to Thy
Word unto Thy servant:” that is, according to that which Thou hast promised unto Thy
servant. Whether therefore it be regeneration whereby we are here adopted among the sons
of God, or faith and hope and charity, which three are built up in us, although they come
from the mercy of God; nevertheless, in this stormy and troublesome life they are the con-
solations of the miserable, not the joys of the blessed.
77. But since those things are destined to happen after and through these, he next saith,
“O let Thy loving mercies come upon me, and I shall live” (ver. 77). For then indeed I shall
truly live, when I shall not be able to fear lest I die. This is styled life absolutely and without

any addition; nor is any life save that which is everlasting and blessed understood, as though
it alone were to be called life, compared with which that which we now lead ought rather
to be called death than life: according to those words in the Gospel, “If thou wilt enter into
life, keep the commandments.”5238…
78. He then goeth on as follows: “Let the proud be confounded, for they have unright-
eously practised iniquity against me: but I will be occupied in Thy commandments” (ver.
78). Behold, what he saith, the meditation of the law of God, or rather, his meditation the
law of God.
79. “Let such as fear Thee,” he saith, “and have known Thy testimonies, be turned unto
me”5239 (ver. 79). But who is he who saith this? For no mortal will venture to say this, or if
he say it, should be listened to. Indeed, it is He who above also hath interposed His own
words, saying, “I am a partaker with all them that fear Thee.” Because He was made sharer
in our mortal state, that we might also become partakers in His Divine Nature, we became
sharers in One unto life, He a sharer in many unto death. He it is unto whom they that fear
God turn, and who know the testimonies of God, so long before predicted of Him through
the Prophets, a little before displayed in His presence through miracles.
80. “O let my heart,” he saith, “be unspotted in Thy righteousnesses, that I be not
ashamed” (ver. 80). He returneth to the words of His body, that is, His holy people, and
now prayeth that his heart may be made unspotted, that is, the heart of His members; “in
the righteousnesses of God,” not in their own strength: for He hath prayed for this, not
presumed upon it. In the words he hath added, “that I be not ashamed,” there is a resemblance
to some of the earlier verses of this Psalm.5240 Whereas there, in the words, “O that,” he
signifieth a wish, he hath here expressed himself in the more open words of one praying:
“O let my heart be sound:” so that in neither of these two sentences, each of which is one
and the same, there is found the boldness of one who trusteth in his own free will against
grace. While he saith there, “so shall I not be confounded:” he saith here, “that I be not
ashamed.” The heart then of the members and the body of Christ is made unspotted, through
the grace of God, by means of the very Head of that Body, that is, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, by the “laver of regeneration,”5241 wherein all our past sins have been blotted out;
through the aid of the Spirit, whereby we lust against the flesh, that we be not overcome in
our fight;5242 through the efficacy of the Lord’s Prayer, wherein we say, “Forgive us our

trespasses.”5243 Thus regeneration having been given to us, our conflict having been aided,
prayer having been poured forth, our heart is made unspotted, so that we be not ashamed.5244

81. “My soul hath failed for Thy salvation: and I have hoped because of Thy word” (ver.
81). It is not every failing that should be supposed to be blameable or deserving punishment:
there is also a failing that is laudable or desirable.…For it is said of a good failing: “My soul
hath a desire and failing to enter into the courts of the Lord.”5245 So also here he saith not,
faileth away from Thy salvation, but “faileth for Thy salvation,” that is, towards Thy salvation.
This losing ground is therefore good: for it doth indicate a longing after good, not as yet
indeed gained, but most eagerly and earnestly desired. But who saith this, save the chosen
generation, the royal priesthood, the holy nation, the peculiar people,5246 longing for Christ
from the origin of the human race even unto the end of this world, in the persons of those
who, each in his own time, have lived, are living, or are to live here?…The first seasons of
the Church, therefore, had Saints, before the Virgin’s delivery, who desired the advent of
His Incarnation: but these times, since He hath ascended into heaven, have Saints who desire
His manifestation to judge the quick and the dead.…“And I have hoped because of Thy
word:” that is, of Thy promise; a hope which causeth us to await with patience that which
is not seen by those who believe. Here also the Greek hath the word ἐπήλπισα, which some
of our translators have preferred rendering by, “hoped-more;” since beyond doubt it will
be greater than can be described.
82. “Mine eyes,” he saith, “have failed for Thy word, saying, O when wilt Thou comfort
me?” (ver. 82). Behold that praiseworthy and blessed failing, in the eyes again, but his inner
eyes, not arising from infirmity of mind, but from the strength of his longing for the
promise of God: for this he saith, “for Thy word.” But in what sense can such eyes say,
“When wilt Thou comfort me?” save when we pray and groan with such earnestness and
ardent expectation? For the tongue, not the eyes, is wont to speak: but in some sense the
voice of the eyes is the longing of prayer. But in the words, “When wilt Thou comfort me?”
he showeth that he endureth as it were delay. Whence is this also, “How long, Lord, wilt
Thou punish me?”5247 And this is done either that the happiness may be the sweeter when
deferred, or this is the sentiment of those who long, since the space of time, which may be
short to Him who cometh to their aid, is tedious to the loving. But God knoweth what He
doth and when, for He “hath ordered all things in measure and number and weight.”5248
83. But when spiritual desires burn, carnal desires without doubt cool: on this account
followeth, “Since I am become like a bottle in the frost, I do not forget Thy righteousnesses”
(ver. 83). Truly he desireth this mortal flesh to be understood by the bottle, the heavenly

blessing by the frost, whereby the lusts of the flesh as it were by the binding of the frost be-
come sluggish; and hence it ariseth that the righteousnesses of God do not slip from the
memory, as long as we do not meditate apart from them; since what the Apostle saith is
brought to pass: “Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.” 5249 “And I
do not forget Thy righteousness:” that is, I forget them not, because I have become such.
For the fervour of lust hath cooled, that the memory of love might glow.
84. “How many are the days of Thy servant? when wilt Thou be avenged of them that
persecute me?” (ver. 84). In the Apocalypse,5250 these are the words of the Martyrs, and
long-suffering is enjoined them until the number of their brethren be fulfilled. The body of
Christ then is asking concerning its days, what they are to be in this world, and that no man
might suppose that the Church would cease to exist here before the end of the world came,
and that some time would elapse in this world, while the Church was now no more on earth;
therefore, when he had enquired concerning the days, he added also respecting the judgment,
showing indeed that the Church would exist on earth until the judgment, when vengeance
shall fall upon Her persecutors. But if any one wonder why he should ask that question, to
which when asked by the disciples, their Master replied, “It is not for you to know the times
and the seasons;”5251 why should we not believe that in this passage of the Psalm it was
prophesied that they should ask this very question, and that the words of the Church, which
were so long before uttered here, were fulfilled in their question?
85. In what followeth: “The wicked have told me pleasant tales: but not like Thy law, O
Lord” (ver. 85): the Latin translators have endeavoured to render the Greek ‡δολεσχίας,
which cannot be expressed in one Latin word, so that some have rendered it “delights,” and
others “fablings,” so that we must understand to be meant some kind of compositions, but
in discourse of a nature to give pleasure. Both secular literature, and the Jewish book entitled
Deuterosis,5252 containing besides the canon of divine Scripture thousands of tales, comprise
these in their different sects and professions; the vain and wandering loquacity of heretics
holds them also. All these he wished to be considered as wicked, by whom he saith that
‡δολεσχίαι were related to him, that is, compositions which gave pleasure solely in their
style: “But not,” he addeth, “as Thy law, O Lord;” because truth, not words, pleases me
therein.5253

86. Lastly, he addeth, “All Thy commandments are truth: they have persecuted me un-
justly; O be Thou my help” (ver. 86). And the whole sense dependeth upon the foregoing:
“How many are the days of Thy servant: when wilt Thou be avenged of them that persecute
me?”5254 For that they may persecute me, they have related to me these pleasant tales; but
I have preferred Thy law to them, which on that account hath pleased me more, because all
Thy commandments are true; not as in their discourses, where vanity aboundeth. And for
this reason “they have persecuted me falsely,” because in me they have persecuted nothing
save the truth. Therefore help Thou me, that I may struggle for the truth even unto death;
because this is at once Thy commandment, and therefore it is also the truth.
87. When the Church acted thus, She suffered what he hath added, “They had almost
made an end of me upon earth” (ver. 87): a great slaughter of martyrs having been made,
while they confess and preach the truth. But since it is not in vain said, “O help Thou me;”
he addeth, “But I forsook not Thy commandments.”
88. And that She might persevere unto the end, “O quicken me,” he saith, “after Thy
loving mercy: and so shall I keep the testimonies of Thy mouth” (ver. 88); where the Greek
hath Μαρτύρια. This was not to be passed over in silence, on account of that sweetest name
of Martyrs, who beyond doubt when so great cruelty of the persecutors was raging, that the
Church was almost made an end of upon earth, would never have kept the testimonies of
God, unless that had been vouchsafed them which is here spoken of, “O quicken me after
Thy loving-kindness.” For they were quickened, lest by loving life, they should deny the life,
and by denying it, should lose it: and thus they who for life refused to forsake the truth, lived
by dying for the truth.

89. The man who speaketh in this Psalm, as if he were tired of human mutability, whence
this life is full of temptations, among his tribulations, on account of which he had above
said, “The wicked have persecuted me;”5255 and, “They have almost made an end of me
upon earth”5256 (ver. 89); burning with longings for the heavenly Jerusalem; looked up to
the realms above, and said, “O Lord, Thy word endureth for ever in heaven;” that is, among
Thy Angels who serve everlastingly in Thine armies, without desertion.
90. But the next verse, after heaven, pertaineth consequently to earth. For this is one
verse of the eight which relate to this letter. For eight verses are appended to each of these
Hebrew letters,5257 until this long Psalm be ended. “Thy truth also remaineth from one
generation to the other: Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth, and it abideth” (ver. 90).
Beholding therefore the earth next after heaven with the gaze of a faithful mind, he findeth
in it generations which are not in heaven, and saith, “Thy truth remaineth from one gener-
ation to the other:” signifying all generations by this expression, from which the Truth of
God was never absent in His saints, at one time fewer, at one time more in number, according
as the times happened or shall happen to vary; or wishing two particular generations to be
understood, one pertaining to the Law and the Prophets, another to the Gospel.…
91. “Day continueth according to Thy ordinance” (ver. 91). For all these things are day:
“and this is the day which the Lord hath made: let us rejoice and be glad in it:”5258 and “let
us walk honestly as in the day.”5259 “For all things serve Thee.” He said all things of some:
“all” which belong to this day “serve Thee.” For the ungodly of whom it is said, “I have
compared thy mother unto the night,”5260 do not serve Thee.
92. He then looketh back towards the source of this earth’s deliverance, which caused
it to abide when founded; and addeth, “If my delight had not been in Thy law, I should
perchance have perished in my humiliation” (ver. 92). This is the law of faith, not a vain
faith, but that which worketh through love.5261 Through this grace is gained, which maketh
men courageous in temporal tribulation, that they may not perish in the humiliation of
mortality.

93. “I will never forget,” he saith, “Thy righteousnesses, for with them Thou hast
quickened me” (ver. 93). Behold how it was that he did not perish in his humiliation. For,
save God quickeneth, what is man, Who can indeed kill, but cannot quicken himself?
94. He next addeth: “I am Thine: O save me, for I have sought Thy righteousnesses”
(ver. 94). We must not understand lightly the words, “I am Thine.” For what is not His?5262
Why then is it that the Psalmist hath commended himself unto God somewhat in a more
familiar sense, in these words, “I am Thine: O save me;” save because he wished it to be
understood that he had desired to be his own only to his harm, which is the first and the
greatest evil of disobedience? and as if he should say, I wished to be my own, and I lost
myself: “I am Thine,” he saith, “O save me, for I have sought Thy righteousnesses;” not my
own inclinations, whereby I was my own, but “Thy righteousnesses,” that I might now be
Thine.
95. “The ungodly,” he saith, “have awaited me that they might destroy me; but I have
understood Thy testimonies” (ver. 95). What meaneth, “that they might destroy me”? Did
he then fear that he should perish altogether at the death of his body? God forbid! and what
meaneth, “have awaited me,” save that he should consent with them unto iniquity? For then
they would destroy him. And he hath said why he hath not perished: “I understood Thy
testimonies.” The Greek word, Μαρτύρια, soundeth more familiarly to the ears of the
Church. For though they should slay me not consenting unto them, yet while I confessed
Thy testimonies (martyria) I should not perish; but they who, that they might destroy me,
were waiting till I should consent unto them, tortured me even when I did confess them.
Yet he did not leave that which he had understood, looking on it and seeing an end without
end, if only he should persevere unto the end.
96. Lastly, he next saith, “I have seen an end of all consummation: but Thy commandment
is exceeding broad” (ver. 96). For he had entered into the sanctuary of God, and had under-
stood the end.5263 Now “all consummation” appeareth to me in this place to signify, the
striving even unto death for the truth,5264 and the endurance of every evil for the true and
chief good: the end of which consummation is to excel in the kingdom of Christ, which hath
no end; and there to have without death, without pain, and with great honour, life, acquired
by the death of this life, and by sorrows and reproaches. But in what he hath added, “Thy
commandment is exceeding broad;” I understand only love. For what would it have profited
him, whatever death impended over him, in the midst of whatsoever torment, to confess
those testimonies, if love were not in the confessor?…Broad therefore is the commandment
of charity, that twofold commandment, whereby we are enjoined to love God and our

neighbour. But what is broader than that, “on” which “hang all the Law and the Proph-
ets”?5265
5265 Matt. xxii. 37–40.
Lamed.
Mem.
97. We have frequently admonished you, that love was to be understood by that
praiseworthy breadth, by means of which, while we do the commandments of God, we feel
no straitness. On this account also after saying above in this great Psalm, “Thy commandment
is exceeding broad:”5266 in the following verse he showeth wherefore it is broad: “what love
have I unto Thy law, O Lord!” (ver. 97). Love is therefore the breadth of the commandment.
For how can it be that what God commandeth to be loved, be loved, and yet the command-
ment itself be not loved? For this itself is the law; “in all the day,” he saith, “is my study in
it.” Behold how I have loved it, that in the whole day my study is in it; or rather, as the Greek
hath it, “all the day long,” which more fully expresses the continuance of meditation. Now
that is to be understood through all time; which is, for ever. By such love lust is driven out:
lust, which repeatedly opposeth our performing the commandments of the law, when “the
flesh lusteth against the spirit:”5267 against which the spirit lusting, ought so to love the law
of God, that it be its study during the whole day.…
98. And he then addeth: “Thou hast made me to understand Thy commandment above
mine enemies; for it is ever with me” (ver. 98). For “they have indeed a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge,” etc.5268 But the Psalmist, who understandeth the commandment
of God above these his enemies, wishes to be found with the Apostle, “not having” his “own
righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ, which is of
God;”5269 not that the Law which his enemies read is not of God, but because they do not
understand it, like him who understandeth it above his enemies, by clinging to the Stone
upon which they stumbled. For “Christ is the end of the law,” etc.,5270 “that they may be
justified freely through His grace;”5271 not like those who imagine that they obey the law
of their own strength, and are therefore, though by God’s law, yet still endeavouring to set
up their own righteousness; but as the son of promise, who hungering and athirst after it,5272
by seeking, by asking, by knocking,5273 as it were begs it of the Father, that being adopted
he may receive it through His only-begotten Son.…His enemies sought from the same
commandment temporal rewards; and therefore it was not unto them for ever, as it was
unto this man. For they who have translated “for ever” have rendered better than they who

have written “for an age,” since at the end of time there can be no longer a commandment

99. But what meaneth the following verse, “I have more understanding than my teach-
ers”? (ver. 99). Who is he who had more understanding than all his teachers? Who, I ask,
is he, who dareth to prefer himself in understanding above all the Prophets, who not only
by speaking taught with so excellent authority those who lived with them, but also their
posterity by writing?…What is here said, could not have been spoken in Solomon’s person.…I
recognise plainly Him who had more understanding than His teachers, since when He was
a boy of twelve years of age, Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and was found by His
parents after three days’ space, “sitting in the temple among the doctors, hearing them and
asking them questions.”5274 The Son Himself hath said, “As My Father hath taught Me, I
speak these things.”5275 It is very difficult to understand this of the Person of the Word;
unless we can comprehend that it is the same thing for the Son to be taught as to be begotten
of the Father.…“He took upon Himself the form of a servant;”5276 for when He had assumed
this form, men of more advanced age might think Him fit to be taught as a boy; but He
whom the Father taught, had more understanding than all His teachers. “For Thy testimon-
ies,” He saith, “are my study.” For this reason He had more understanding than all His
teachers, because He studied the testimonies of God, which, as concerning Himself, He
knew better than they, when He spoke these words: “Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness
unto the truth. But I receive not testimony from man,” etc.5277
100. But these teachers may be understood very reasonably to be those aged men, of
whom he presently saith, “I am wiser than mine elders” (ver. 100). And this seemeth to me
to be repeated here thus, that that age of His which is well known to us in the Gospel might
be called to our remembrance; the age of boyhood, during which He was sitting among the
aged, understanding more than all His teachers. For the smaller and the greater in age are
wont to be termed younger and elder, although neither of them hath arrived at or approached
old age; although if we are concerned to seek in the Gospel the express term, elders, more
than whom He understood, we find it when the Scribes and Pharisees said unto Him, “Why
do Thy disciples transgression the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands
when they eat bread.”5278 Behold the transgression of the tradition of the elders is objected
to Him. But He who was wiser than His elders, let us hear what answer He made them.
“Why do ye also, He asked, “transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?”5279…

101. But what cometh next, doth not seem to apply to the Head, but to the Body: “I have
refrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep Thy words” (ver. 101). For that Head
of ours, the Saviour of the Body Himself, could not be borne by carnal lust into any evil way,
so that it should be needful for Him to refrain His feet, as though they would go thither of
their own accord; which we do, when we refrain our evil desires, which He had not, that
they may not follow evil ways. For thus we are able to keep the word of God, if we “go not
after our evil lusts,”5280 so that they attain unto the evils desired; but rather curb them with
the spirit which lusteth against the flesh,5281 that they may not drag us away, seduced and
overthrown, through evil ways.
102. “I have not shrunk,” he saith, “from Thy judgments: for Thou hast laid down a law
for me” (ver. 102). He hath stated what made him fear, so that he refrained his feet from
every evil way.…Thou, more inward than my inmost self, Thou hast laid down a law within
my heart by Thy Spirit, as it were by Thy fingers, that I might not fear it as a slave without
love, but might love it with a chaste fear as a son, and fear it with a chaste love.
103. Consider then what followeth: “O how sweet are Thy words unto my throat!” (ver.
103). Or, as it is more literally rendered from the Greek, “Thy utterances, above honey and
the honeycomb unto my mouth.” This is that sweetness which the Lord giveth, “So that the
earth yield her increase:”5282 that we do good truly in a good spirit, that is, not from the
dread of carnal evil, but from the gladness of spiritual good. Some copies indeed do not read
“honeycomb:” but the majority do. Now the open teaching of wisdom is like unto honey;
but that is like the comb which is squeezed from the more recondite mysteries, as if from
cells of wax, by the mouth of the teacher, as if he were chewing it: but it is sweet to the mouth
of the heart, not to the mouth of the flesh.
104. But what mean the words, “Through Thy commandments I get understanding”?
(ver. 104). For the expressions, I have understood Thy commandments: and, “I get under-
standing through Thy commandments;” are different. Something else then he signifieth
that he hath understood from the commandments of God: that is, as far as I can see, he
saith, that by obeying God’s commandments he hath arrived at the comprehension of those
things which he had longed to know.…These then are the words of the spiritual members
of Christ, “Through Thy commandments I get understanding.” For the body of Christ rightly
saith these words in those, to whom, while they keep the commandments, a richer knowledge
of wisdom is given on account of this very keeping of the commandments. “Therefore,” he
addeth, “I hate all evil ways.” For it is needful that the love of righteousness should hate all
iniquity: that love, which is so much the stronger, in proportion as the sweetness of a higher

105. “Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my paths” (ver. 105). The
word “lantern” appears in the word “light;” “my feet” are also repeated in “my paths.” What
then meaneth “Thy Word”?5283 Is it He who was in the beginning God with God, that is,
the Word by whom all things were made? It is not thus. For that Word is a light, but is not
a lantern. For a lantern is a creature, not a creator; and it is lighted by participation of an
unchangeable light.…For no creature, howsoever rational and intellectual, is lighted by itself,
but is lighted by participation of eternal Truth: although sometimes day is spoken of, not
meaning the Lord, but that “day which the Lord hath made,”5284 and on account of which
it is said, “Come unto Him, and be lightened.”5285 On account of which participation,
inasmuch as the Mediator Himself became Man, He is styled lantern in the Apocalypse.5286
But this sense is a solitary one; for it cannot be divinely spoken of any of the saints, nor in
any wise lawfully said of any, “The Word was made flesh,”5287 save of the “one Mediator
between God and men.”5288 Since therefore the only-begotten Word, coequal with the
Father, is styled a light; and man when enlightened by the Word is also called a light, who
is styled also a lantern, as John, as the Apostles; and since no man of these is the Word, and
that Word by whom they were enlightened is not a lantern; what is this word, which is thus
called a light and a lantern at the same time, save we understand the word which was sent
unto the Prophets, or which was preached through the Apostles; not Christ the Word, but
the word of Christ, of which it is written, “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word
of God”?5289 For the Apostle Peter also, comparing the prophetical word to a lantern, saith,
“whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lantern, that shineth in a dark place.”5290
What, therefore, he here saith, “Thy word” is the word which is contained in all the holy
Scriptures.
106. “I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed to keep Thy righteous judgments” (ver.
106): as one who walked aright in the light of that lantern, and kept to straight paths. For
he calleth what he hath determined by a sacrament, an oath; because the mind ought to be
so fixed in keeping the righteous judgments of God, that its determination should be in the
place of an oath. Now the righteous judgments of God are kept by faith; when, under the

righteous judgment of God, neither any good work is believed to be fruitless, nor any sin
unpunished; but, because the body of Christ hath suffered many most grievous evils for this
faith, he saith, “I was humbled above measure” (ver. 107). He doth not say, I have humbled
myself, so that we must needs understand that humiliation which is commanded; but he
saith, “I was humbled above-measure;” that is, suffered a very heavy persecution, because
he swore and was steadfastly purposed to keep the righteous judgments of God. And, lest
in such trouble faith herself might faint he addeth, “Quicken me, O Lord, according to Thy
word:” that is, according to Thy promise. For the word of the promises of God is a lantern
to the feet, and a light to the paths. Thus also above, in the humiliation of persecution, he
prayed that God would quicken him.5291…
107. “Make the freewill offerings of my mouth well pleasing, O Lord” (ver. 108): that
is, let them please Thee; do not reject, but approve them. By the freewill offerings of the
mouth are well understood the sacrifices of praise, offered up in the confession of love, not
from the fear of necessity; whence it is said, “a freewill offering will I offer Thee.”5292 But
what doth he add? “and teach me Thy judgments”? Had he not himself said above, “From
Thy judgments I have not swerved”? How could he have done thus, if he knew them not?
Moreover, if he knew them, in what sense doth he here say, “and teach me Thy judgments”?
Is it as in a former passage, “Thou hast dealt in sweetness with Thy servant:” presently after
which we find, “teach me sweetness”? This passage we explained as the words of one who
was gaining in grace, and praying that he might receive in addition to what he had received.
108. “My soul is alway in Thy hand” (ver. 109). Some copies read, “in my hand:” but
most, “in Thy hand;” and this latter is indeed easy. For “the souls of the righteous are in
God’s hand:5293 in whose hand are both we and our words.”5294 “And I do not forget Thy
law:” as if his memory were aided to remember God’s law by the hands of Him in whose
hands is his soul. But how the words, “My soul is in my hands,” can be understood, I know
not. For these are the words of the righteous, not of the ungodly; of one who is returning
to the Father, not departing from the Father.5295…Is it perhaps said, “My soul is in my
hands,” in this sense, as if he offered it to God to be quickened? Whence in another passage
it is said, “Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.”5296 Since here too he had said
above, “Quicken Thou me.”

109. “The ungodly,” he saith, “have laid a snare for me: but yet I swerved not from Thy
commandments” (ver. 110). Whence this, unless because his soul is in the hands of God,
or in his own hands is offered to God to be quickened?
110. “Thy testimonies have I gained in heritage for ever” (ver. 111). Some wishing to
express in one word what is put in one word in the Greek, have translated it hereditavi.
Which although it might be Latin, yet would rather signify one who gave an inheritance
than one who received it, hereditavi being like ditavi. Better, therefore, the whole sense is
conveyed in two words, whether we say, “I have possessed in heritage,” or, “I have gotten
in heritage:” not gotten heritage, but “gotten in heritage.” If it be asked, what he gained in
heritage, he replieth, “Thy testimonies.” What doth he wish to be understood, save that he
might become a witness of God, and confess His testimonies, that is, that he might become
a Martyr of God, and might declare His testimonies, as the Martyrs do, was a gift bestowed
upon him by the Father, of whom he is heir?…But even their wish was prepared by the
Lord. For this reason he saith he hath gained them in heritage, and this “for ever;” because
they have not in them the temporal glory of men who seek vain things, but the eternal glory
of those who suffer for a short season, and who reign without end. Whence the next words,
“Because they are the very joy of my heart:” although the affliction of the body, yet the very
joy of the heart.
111. He then addeth: “I have applied my heart to fulfil Thy righteousness for ever, for
my reward” (ver. 112). He who saith, “I have applied my heart,” had before said, “Incline
my heart unto Thy testimonies:”5297 so that we may understand that it is at once a divine
gift, and an act of free will. But are we to fulfil the righteousnesses of God for ever? Those
works which we perform in regard to the need of our neighbours, cannot be everlasting,
any more than their need; but if we do not do them from love, there is no righteousness; if
we do them from love, that love is everlasting, and an everlasting reward is in store for it.

112. “I have hated the unrighteous; and Thy law have I loved” (ver. 113). He saith not,
I hate the wicked, and love the righteous; or, I hate iniquity, and love Thy law; but, after
saying, “I have hated the unrighteous,” he explains why, by adding, “and Thy law have I
loved;” to show, that he did not hate human nature in unrighteous men, but their unright-
eousness whereby they are foes to the law, which he loveth.
113. He next addeth: “Thou art my helper and my taker up” (ver. 114): “my helper,” to
do good works: “my taker up,” to escape evil ones. In the next words, “I have hoped more
on Thy word,” he speaketh as a son of promise.
114. But what is the meaning of the following verse: “Away from me, ye wicked, and I
will search the commandments of my God”? (ver. 115). For he saith not, I will perform; but,
“I will search.” In order, therefore, that he may diligently and perfectly learn that law, he
bids the wicked depart from him, and even forcibly driveth them away from his company.
For the wicked exercise us in the fulfilment of the commandments, but lead us away from
searching into them; not only when they persecute, or wish to litigate with us; but even when
they court us, and honour us, and yet expect us to occupy ourselves in aiding their own vi-
cious and busy desire, and to bestow our time upon them; or at least harass the weak, and
compel them to bring their causes before us: to whom we dare not say, “Man, who made
me a judge or a divider over you?”5298 For the Apostle instituted ecclesiastical judges of
such causes, forbidding Christians to contend in the forum.5299…Certainly, on account of
those who carry on law suits pertinaciously with one another, and, when they harass the
good, scorn our judgments, and cause us to lose the time that should be employed upon
things divine; surely, I say, on account of these men we also may exclaim in these words of
the Body of Christ, “Away from me, ye wicked! and I will search the commandments of my
God.”
115. “O stablish me according to Thy word and I shall live: and let me not be disappointed
of my hope” (ver. 116). He who had before said, “Thou art my taker up,” prayeth that he
may be more and more borne up, and be led unto that, for the sake of which he endureth
so many troubles; trusting that he may there live in a truer sense, than in these dreams of
human affairs. For it is said of the future, “and I shall live,” as if we did not live in this dead
body. While “we await the redemption of our body, we are saved by hope, and hoping for
that we see not, we await with patience.”5300 But hope disappointeth not, if the love of God
be spread abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.5301 And, as

though it were answered him in silence, Thou dost not wish to be disappointed of thy hope?
Cease not to meditate upon My righteousnesses: and, feeling that this meditation is usually
hindered by the weaknesses of the soul, “Help me,” he saith, “and I shall be safe; yea, I will
meditate in Thy righteousnesses always” (ver. 117).
116. “Thou hast scorned all,” or, as it seems more closely translated from the Greek,
“Thou hast brought to nought all them that depart from Thy righteousnesses: for their
thought is unrighteous” (ver. 118). For this reason he exclaimed, “Help Thou me, and I shall
be safe; yea, I will meditate in Thy righteousnesses always:” because God bringeth to nought
all those who depart from His righteousnesses. But why do they depart? Because “their
thought is,” he saith, “unrighteous.” They advance in that direction, while they depart from
God. All deeds, good or bad, proceed from the thoughts: in his thoughts every man is inno-
cent, in his thoughts every man is guilty.…
117. The next words in the Psalm are, “I have counted,” or “thought,” or “esteemed, all
the ungodly of the earth as transgressors” (ver. 119). In the Latin version many different
renderings are given of the Greek ἐλογισ€μην; but this passage hath a deep meaning. For
the following words, “Therefore have I ever loved Thy testimonies:” make it far more pro-
found. For the Apostle saith, “The law worketh wrath;” and, explaining these words, he ad-
deth, “For where no law is, there is no transgression:”5302 thereby showing that not all are
transgressors. For all have not the law. That all have not the law, he declareth more explicitly
in another passage, “as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law.”5303
What then meaneth, “I have held all the ungodly of the earth as transgressors”? “As trans-
gressors;” or rather “transgressing,” for the Greek saith, παραβαίνοντας, not παραβ€τας.…
“The law entered that sin might abound.” But since all sins are remitted through grace, not
only those which are committed without the law, but those also which are committed in the
law; he addeth, “But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.”5304…But, indeed,
when the Apostle said, “As many as have sinned without law, shall perish without law,” he
was speaking of that law which God gave to His people Israel through Moses His ser-
vant.…For some even Catholic expositors, from a want of sufficient heedfulness, have pro-
nounced contrary to the truth, that those who have sinned without the law perish; and that
those who have sinned in the law, are only judged, and do not perish, as if they should be
considered destined to be cleansed by means of transitory punishments, as he of whom it
is said, “he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.”5305…The Psalmist also hath subjoined:
5302 Rom. iv. 15.

5304 Rom. v. 20.

“Therefore I loved Thy testimonies.”5306 As if he should say: Since the law, whether given
in paradise, or implanted by nature, or promulgated in writing, hath made all the sinners
of the earth transgressors; “Therefore I loved Thy testimonies,” which are in Thy laws of
Thy grace; so that not my but Thy righteousness is in me. For the law profiteth unto this
end, that it send us forward unto grace. For not only because it testifieth towards the mani-
festation of the righteousness of God, which is without the law; but also in this very point
that it rendereth men transgressors, so that the letter even slayeth, it driveth us to fly unto
the quickening Spirit, through whom the whole of our sins may be blotted out, and the love
of righteous deeds be inspired.5307…
118. The grace of God, then, being known, which alone freeth from transgression, which
is committed through knowledge of the law, he saith, in prayer, “Fix with nails my flesh in
Thy fear” (ver. 120). For this some Latin interpreters have literally rendered the Greek
καθήλωσον, which that language has expressed in one word. Some have preferred to render
by the word confige, without adding clavis; and while they thus desire to construe one Latin
by one Greek word, have failed to express the full meaning of the Greek καθήλωσον, because
in confige nails are not mentioned, but καθήλωσον cannot be taken but of nails, nor can
“fix with nails” be expressed without using two words in Latin.…Hath he added, “For I have
feared Thy judgments”? What meaneth, “Fix me in Thy fear: for I have feared”? If he had
already feared, or if he was now fearing, why did he still pray God to crucify his flesh in His
fear? Did he wish so much additional fear imparted to him as would suffice for crucifying
his flesh, that is, his carnal lusts and affections; as though he should say, Perfect in me the
fear of Thee; for I have feared Thy judgments? But there is here even a higher sense, which
must, as far as God alloweth, be derived from searching the recesses of this Scripture: that
is, in the chaste fear of Thee, which abideth from age to age, let my carnal desires be
quenched;5308 “For I have feared Thy judgments,” when the law, which could not give me
righteousness, threatened me punishment.…For the inclination to sin liveth, and it then
appeareth in deed, when impunity may be hoped for. But when punishment is considered
sure to follow, it liveth latently: nevertheless it liveth. For it would rather it were lawful to
sin, and it grieveth that what the law forbiddeth, is not lawful; because it is not spiritually
delighted with the blessing of the law, but carnally feareth the evil which it threateneth.5309
But that love, which casteth out this fear, feareth with a chaste fear to sin, although no
punishment follow; because it doth not even judge that impunity will follow, since from

love of righteousness it considereth the very sin itself a punishment. With such a fear the
flesh is crucified; since carnal delights, which are forbidden rather than avoided by the letter
of the law, are overcome by the delight in spiritual blessings, and also when the victory is
perfected are destroyed.

119. “I have dealt judgment and righteousness; O give me not over unto mine oppress-
ors”5310 (ver. 121). It is not wonderful that he should have dealt judgment and righteousness,
since he had above prayed for a chaste fear from God, whereby to fix with nails his flesh,
that is, his carnal lusts, which are wont to hinder our judgment from being right. But although
in our customary speech judgment is either right or wrong, whence it is said unto men in
the Gospel, “Judge not according to the persons, but judge righteous judgment:” 5311 never-
theless in this passage judgment is used as though, if it were not righteous, it ought not to
be called judgment; otherwise it would not be enough to say, “I have dealt judgment,” but
it would be said, I have dealt righteous judgment.…
120. Whoso therefore in the chaste fear of God hath his flesh crucified, and corrupted
by no carnal allurement, dealeth judgment and the work of righteousness, ought to pray
that he may not be given up to his adversaries; that is, that he may not, through his dread
of suffering evils, yield unto his adversaries to do evil. For he receiveth power of endurance,
which guardeth him from being overcome with pain, from Him from whom he receiveth
the victory over lust, which preventeth his being seduced by pleasure.5312
121. He next saith, “Take off Thy servant to that which is good, that the proud calumniate
me not” (ver. 122). They drive me on, that I may fall into evil; do Thou take me off to that
which is good. They who rendered these words by the Latin, calumnientur, have followed
a Greek expression, not commonly used in Latin. Have the words, Let not the proud calum-
niate me, the same force, as, Let them “not succeed in calumniating me”?
122. …To prefigure His Cross, Moses by the merciful command of God raised aloft on
a pole the image of a serpent in the desert, that the likeness of sinful flesh which must be
crucified in Christ might be prefigured.5313 By gazing upon this healing Cross, we cast out
all the poison of the scandals of the proud: the Cross, which the Psalmist intently looking
upon, saith, “My eyes have failed for Thy salvation, and for the words of Thy righteousness”
(ver. 123). For God made Christ Himself “to be sin for us, on account of the likeness of
sinful flesh, that we may be made the righteousness of God in Him.” 5314 For His utter-

being variously interpreted by the Latin nocentibus, persequentibus, and calumniantibus. I wonder, however,
that I have never met with the version adversantibus in any of the copies which I have read, since there is no
doubt that the Greek ‡ντίδικος is the same as the Latin adversarius. While he prays therefore that he may not
be given up to his adversaries by the Lord, what doth he pray, save what we pray, when we say, ‘Lead us not into
temptation’?”—C.]

ance5315 of the righteousness of God he therefore saith that his eyes have failed, from gazing
ardently and eagerly, while, remembering human infirmity, he longeth for divine grace in
Christ.
123. In connection with this he goes on to say, “O deal with Thy servant according to
Thy loving mercy” (ver. 124); not according to my righteousness. “And teach me,” he saith,
“Thy righteousnesses;” those beyond doubt, whereby God rendereth men righteous, not
they themselves.
124. “I am Thy servant. O grant me understanding, that I may know Thy testimonies”
(ver. 125). This petition must never be intermitted. For it sufficeth not to have received
understanding, and to have learnt the testimonies of God, unless it be evermore received,
and evermore in a manner quaffed from the fountain of eternal light. For the testimonies
of God are the better and the better known, the more understanding a man attaineth to.
125. “It is time,” he saith, “for the Lord to lay to His hand” (ver. 126). For this is the
reading of most copies: not as some have, “O Lord.” Now what is this, save the grace which
was revealed in Christ at its own time? Of which season the Apostle saith, “But when the
fullness of time was come, God sent His Son.”5316…But wherefore is it that, seemingly
anxious to show the Lord that it was time to lay to His hand, he hath subjoined, “They have
scattered Thy law;” as if it were the season for the Lord to act, because the proud scattered
His law. For what meaneth this? In the wickedness of transgression, they have not guarded
its integrity. It was needful therefore that the Law should be given to the proud and those
presuming in the freedom of their own will, after a transgression of which whosoever were
contrite and humbled, might run no longer by the Law, but by faith, to aiding grace. When
the Law therefore was scattered, it was time that mercy should be sent through the only-
begotten Son of God.
126. “Therefore,” he saith, “I love Thy commandments above gold and topaz” (ver. 127).
Grace hath this object, that the commandments, which could not be fulfilled by fear, may
be fulfilled by love…Therefore, they are above gold and topaz stones. For this is read in
another Psalm also, “Above gold and exceeding precious stones.”5317 For topaz is a stone
considered very precious. But they not understanding the hidden grace which was in the
Old Testament, screened as it were by the veil5318 (this was signified when they were unable
to gaze upon the face of Moses), endeavoured to obey the commandments of God for the
sake of an earthly and carnal reward, but could not obey them; because they did not love
them, but something else. Whence these were not the works of the willing, but rather the
5315 Eloquium.

burdens of the unwilling. But when the commandments are loved for their own sake “above
gold and exceeding precious stones,” all earthly reward compared with the commandments
themselves is vile; nor are any other goods of man comparable in any respect with those
goods whereby man himself is made good.
127. “Therefore,” he saith, “was I made straight unto all Thy commandments” (ver.
128). I was made straight, doubtless, because I loved them; and I clung by love to them,
which were straight, that I might also myself become straight. Then what he addeth, naturally
follows: “and every unrighteous way I utterly abhor.” For how could it be that he who loved
the straight could do aught save abhor an unrighteous way? For as, if he loved gold and
precious stones, he would abhor all that might bring loss of such property: thus, since he
loved the commandments of God, he abhorred the path of iniquity, as one of the most savage
rocks in the sailor’s track, whereon he must needs suffer shipwreck of things so precious.
That this may not be his lot, he who saileth on the wood of the Cross with the divine com-
mandments as his freight, steereth far from thence.

128. “Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore hath my soul searched them” (ver. 129).
Who counteth, even by their kinds, the testimonies of God? Heaven and earth, His visible
and invisible works, declare in some manner the testimony of His goodness and greatness;
and the very ordinary and accustomed course of nature, whereby the seasons are rapidly
revolved, in all things after their kinds, however temporal and perishable, however held
cheap through our constant experience of them, give, if a pious thinker give heed to them,
a testimony to the Creator. But which of these is not wonderful, if we measure each not by
its habitual presence, but by reason? But if we venture to bring all nature within the compre-
hensive view of one act of contemplation, doth not that take place in us which the prophet
describeth, “I considered Thy works, and trembled”?5319 Yet the Psalmist was not terrified
in his wonder at creation, but rather said that this was the reason that he ought to search it,
because it was wonderful. For after saying, “Thy testimonies are wonderful,” he addeth,
“therefore hath my soul searched them;” as if he had become more curious from the difficulty
of thoroughly searching them. For the more abstruse are the causes of anything, the more
wonderful it is…
129. “When thy word goeth forth,” he saith, “it giveth light, and maketh His little ones
to understand” (ver. 130). What is the little one save the humble and weak? Be not proud
therefore, presume not in thine own strength, which is nought; and thou wilt understand
why a good law was given by a good God, though it cannot give life. For it was given for this
end, that it might make thee a little one instead of great, that it might show that thou hadst
not strength to do the law of thine own power: and that thus, wanting aid and destitute,
thou mightest fly unto grace, saying, “Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.”5320…Let
all be little ones, and let all the world be guilty before Thee: because “by the deeds of the
Law there shall no flesh be justified” in Thy sight; “for by the Law is the knowledge of sin,”
etc.5321 These are Thy wonderful testimonies, which the soul of this little one hath searched;
and hath therefore found, because he became humbled and a little one. For who doth Thy
commandments as they ought to be done, that is, by “faith which worketh through love,”5322
save love itself be shed abroad in his heart through the Holy Spirit?5323
130. This is confessed by this little one; “I opened my mouth,” he saith, “and drew in
the spirit: for I longed for Thy commandments” (ver. 131). What did he long for, save to
obey the divine commandments? But there was no possibility of the weak doing hard things,

the little one great things: he opened his mouth, confessing that he could not do them of
himself: and drew in power to do them: he opened his mouth, by seeking, asking, knock-
ing:5324 and athirst drank in the good Spirit, which enabled him to do what he could not
do by himself, “the commandment holy and just and good.”5325 Not that they themselves
who “are led by the Spirit of God,”5326 do nothing; but that they may not do nothing good,
they are moved to act by the good Spirit. For so much the more is every man made a good
son, in proportion as the good Spirit is given unto Him by the Father in a greater measure.
131. He still prayeth. He hath opened his mouth, and drawn in the Spirit; but he still
knocketh in prayer unto the Father, and seeketh: he drinketh, but the more sweet he findeth
it, the more eagerly doth he thirst. Hear the words of him in his thirst. “O look Thou upon
me,” he saith, “and be merciful unto me: according to the judgment of those that love Thy
Name” (ver. 132): that is, according to the judgment Thou has dealt unto all who love Thy
Name; since Thou hast first loved them, to cause them to love Thee. For thus saith the
Apostle John, “We love God, because He first loved us.”5327
132. See what the Psalmist next most openly saith: “Order my steps after Thy word: and
so shall no wickedness have dominion over me” (ver. 133). Where what else doth he say
than this, Make me upright and free according to Thy promise. But so much the more as
the love of God reigneth in every man, so much the less hath wickedness dominion over
him. What else then doth he seek than that by the gift of God he may love God? For by
loving God he loveth himself, so that he may healthily love his neighbour also as himself:
on which commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.5328 What then doth he pray,
save that God may cause the fulfillment by His help of those commandments which He
imposeth by His bidding?
133. But what meaneth this that he saith, “O deliver me from the calumnies of men: so
shall I keep Thy commandments”? (ver. 134)…Did not the holy people of God much the
more gloriously keep the commandments among these very calumnies, when they were at
their hottest in the midst of tribulations, when they yielded not to their persecutors to
commit impieties? But, in truth, the meaning of these words is this: Do Thou, by pouring
upon me Thy Spirit, guard me from being overcome by the terrors of human calumny, and
from being drawn over to their evil deeds away from Thy commandments. For if Thou hast
thus dealt with me, that is, if Thou hast in this manner delivered me by the gift of patience

me to do Thy will.”5329 For they who hear, although they retain in their memories what
they hear, are by no means to be considered to have learnt, unless they do. For it is the word
of Truth: “Every man that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto Me.”5330
He therefore who obeyeth not in deed, that is, who cometh not, hath not learnt.
135. “My eyes have descended streams of waters, because they have not kept Thy law”
(ver. 136): that is, my eyes. For in some copies there is this reading, “Because I have not kept
Thy law, streams of waters” therefore “descended,” that is, floods of tears.5331…
5329 Ps. cxliii. 10.
5330 John vi. 45.
5331 [He adds: “There are copies which do not read ‘descended,’ but ‘overpassed,’ meaning that he said hy-
perbolically, that in weeping he had overpast streams of waters, that is, by weeping more than the waters flow
in their streams.”—C.]

136. Thus, then, as if giving a reason why he had cause to weep much, and to mourn
deeply for his sin, he saith, “Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and true is Thy judgment” (ver.
137). “Thou hast commanded Thy testimonies, righteousness, and Thy truth exceedingly”
(ver. 138). This righteousness of God and righteous judgment and truth, is to be feared by
every sinner: for thereby all who are condemned are condemned of God; nor is there one
who can righteously complain against the righteous God of his own damnation. Therefore
the tears of the penitent are needful; since if his impenitent heart were condemned, he would
be most justly condemned. He indeed calleth the testimonies of God righteousness: for He
proveth himself righteous by giving righteous commandments. And this is truth also, that
God may become known by such testimonies.
137. But what is it that followeth: “My zeal hath caused me to pine” (ver. 139); or, as
other copies read, Thy zeal? Others have also, “The zeal of Thy house:” and, “hath eaten me
up,” instead of, “hath caused me to pine.” This, as it seems to me, has been considered as
an emendation to be introduced from another Psalm, where it is written, “The zeal of Thy
house hath eaten me up:” 5332 a text quoted also, as we know, in the Gospel. The two words,
however, “hath caused me to pine,” and “hath eaten me up,” are somewhat like. But the
words, “my zeal,” which most of the copies read, occasion no dispute: for what wonder is
it if every man pineth away from his own zeal? The words read in other copies, “Thy zeal,”
signify a man zealous for God, not for himself: but there is no difficulty in using “my” in
the same sense…The Psalmist’s jealousy is therefore also to be understood in a good sense:
for he addeth the cause, and saith, “Because mine enemies have forgotten Thy words.”…
138. Then considering with himself with what a flame of love he burned for the com-
mandments of God: “Fiery,” saith he, “is Thy word exceedingly, and Thy servant hath loved
it” (ver. 140). Justly jealous was he of the impenitent heart in His enemies, who had forgotten
God’s word; for he endeavoured to bring them unto that which he himself most ardently
loved.
139. “I am young, and of no reputation; yet do I not forget Thy righteousnesses:” not
as my enemies, who “have forgotten Thy words” (ver. 141). The younger seems to grieve
for those older than himself who had forgotten the righteousnesses of God, while he himself
had not forgotten. For what meaneth, “I am young, yet do I not forget”? save this, Those
older than me have forgotten. For the Greek word is νεώτερος, the same as that used in the
words above, “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?”5333 This is a comparative,
and is therefore well understood in its relation to some one older. Let us therefore here re-
cognize the two nations, who were striving even in Rebecca’s womb; when it was said to

5333 Ps. cxix. 9.

her, not from works, but of Him that calleth, “The elder shall serve the younger.”5334 But
the younger saith here that he is of no reputation: for this reason he hath become greater:
since “behold, they that were first are last, and they that were last first.”5335
140. It is no wonder that they have forgotten the words of God, who have chosen to set
up their own righteousness, ignorant of the righteousness of God;5336 but he, the younger,
hath not forgotten, for he hath not wished to have a righteousness of his own, but that of
God, of which he now also saith, “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and
Thy law is the truth” (ver. 142). For how is not the law truth, through which came the
knowledge of sin, and that which giveth testimony of the righteousness of God? For thus
the Apostle saith: “The righteousness of God is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and
the Prophets.”5337
141. On account of this law the younger suffered persecution from the elder, so that the
younger saith what followeth: “Trouble and hardship have taken hold upon me: yet is my
meditation in Thy commandments” (ver. 143). Let them rage, let them persecute; as long
as the commandments of God be not abandoned, and, after those commandments, let even
those who rage be loved.
142. “Thy testimonies are righteousness unto everlasting: O grant me understanding,
and I shall live” (ver. 144). This younger one prayeth for understanding; which if he had
not, he would not be “wiser than the aged;”5338 but he prayeth for it in trouble and hardships,
that he may thereby understand how contemptible is all that his persecuting enemies can
take from him, by whom he saith he hath been despised. Therefore he hath said, “and I shall
live:” because if trouble and heaviness reached such a pitch, that his life should be terminated
by the hands of his persecuting enemies, he will live for ever, who preferreth to temporal
things, righteousness which remaineth for evermore. This righteousness in trouble and
hardship are the Martyria Dei, that is, the testimonies of God, for which Martyrs have been
crowned.

143. …He who singeth this Psalm, mentioneth such a prayer of his own: “I have called
with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord!” (ver. 145). For to what end his cry profiteth, he
addeth: “I will search out Thy righteousnesses.” For this purpose then he hath called with
his whole heart, and hath longed that this might be given him by the Lord listening unto
him, that he may search out His righteousnesses…
144. “I have called, save me” (ver. 146) or as some copies, both Greek and Latin, have
it, “I have called to Thee.” But what is, “I have called to Thee,” save that by calling I have
invoked Thee? But when he had said, “save me;” what did he add? “And I will keep Thy
testimonies:” that is, that I may not, through infirmity, deny Thee. For the health of the soul
causeth that to be done which it is known to be our duty to do, and thus in striving even to
the death of the body, if the extremity of temptation demand this in defence of the truth of
the divine testimonies: but where there is not health of the soul, weakness yieldeth, and
truth is deserted…
145. “I have prevented in midnight,” he saith, “and have cried: In Thy words have I
trusted” (ver. 147). If we refer this to each of the faithful, and to the literal character of the
act; it oft happeneth that the love of God is awake in that hour of the night, and, the love of
prayer strongly urging us, the time of prayer, which is wont to be after the crowing of the
cock, is not awaited, but prevented. But if we understand night of the whole of this world’s
duration; we indeed cry unto God at midnight, and prevent the fulness of time in which He
will restore us what He hath promised, as is elsewhere read, “Let us prevent His presence
with confession.”5339 Although if we choose to understand the unripe season of this night,
before the fulness of time had come,5340 that is, the ripe season when Christ should be
manifested in the flesh; neither was the Church then silent, but preventing this fulness of
time, in prophecy cried out, and trusted in the words of God, who was able to do what He
promised, that in the seed of Abraham all nations should be blessed.5341
146. The Church saith also what followeth, “Mine eyes have prevented the morning
watch, that I might meditate on Thy words” (ver. 148). Let us suppose the morning to mean
the season when “a light arose for them that sat in the shadow of death;”5342 did not the
eyes of the Church prevent this morning watch, in those Saints who before were on earth,
because they foresaw beforehand that this would come to pass, so that they meditated on
the words of God, which then were, and announced these things to be destined in the Law
and the Prophets?

147. “Hear my voice, O Lord, according to Thy loving-mercy; and quicken Thou me
according to Thy judgment” (ver. 149). For first God according to His loving-mercy taketh
away punishment from sinners, and will give them life afterwards, when righteous, according
to His judgment; for it is not without a meaning that it is said unto Him, “My song shall be
of mercy and judgment: unto Thee, O Lord;”5343 in this order of the terms: although the
season of mercy itself be not without judgment, whereof the Apostle saith, “If we would
judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord.”5344…And the final season of judgment
shall not be without mercy, since as the Psalm saith, “He crowneth thee with mercy and
loving-kindness.” But “judgment shall be without mercy,” but “unto those” on the left, “who
have not dealt mercy.”5345
148. “They draw nigh, that of malice persecute me:” or, as some copies read, “maliciously”
(ver. 150). Then they that persecute draw nigh, when they go the length of torturing and
destroying the flesh: whence the twenty-first Psalm, wherein the Lord’s Passion is prophesied,
saith, “O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand;”5346 where those things are spoken
of which He suffered when His Passion was not imminent upon Him, but actually realized.
“And are far from Thy law.” The nearer they drew to the persecuting the righteous, so much
the farther were they from righteousness. But what harm did they do unto those, to whom
they drew near by persecution; since the approach of their Lord is nearer unto their souls,
by whom they no wise are forsaken?
149. Lastly, it followeth, “Thou art nigh at hand, O Lord, and all Thy ways are truth”
(ver. 151). Even in their troubles, it hath been a wonted confession of the saints, to ascribe
truth unto God, because they suffer them not undeservedly. So did Queen Esther,5347 so
did holy Daniel,5348 so did the three men in the furnace,5349 so do other associates in their
sanctity confess. But it may be asked, in what sense it is here said, “All Thy ways are truth;”
since in another Psalm it is read, “All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth.”5350 But
towards the saints, All the ways of the Lord are at once mercy and truth: since He aideth
them even in judgment, and thus mercy is not wanting; and in having mercy upon them,
He performeth that which He hath promised, so that truth is not wanting. But towards all,
both those whom He freeth, and those whom He condemneth, all the ways of the Lord are

mercy and truth; because where He doth not show mercy, the truth of His vengeance is
displayed. For He freeth many who have not deserved, but He condemneth none who hath
not deserved it.
150. “From the beginning I have known,” he saith, “as concerning Thy testimonies, that
Thou hast grounded them for ever”5351 (ver. 152)…What are these testimonies, save those
wherein God hath declared that He will give an everlasting kingdom unto His sons? And
since He hath declared that He will give this in His only-begotten Son, he said that the
testimonies themselves were grounded for ever. For that which God hath promised through
them, was everlasting. And for this reason the words, “Thou hast grounded them,” are rightly
thus understood, because they are shown to be true in Christ.5352 Whence then did the
Psalmist know this in the beginning, save because the Church speaketh, which was not
wanting to the earth from the commencement of the human race, the first-fruits whereof
was the holy Abel, himself sacrificed in testimony of the future blood of the Mediator that
should be shed by a wicked brother?5353 For this also was at the beginning, “They two shall
be one flesh:”5354 which great mystery the Apostle Paul expounding, saith, “I speak concern-
ing Christ and the Church.”5355
5351 [Here the author says: “The Greek word καταρχὰς hath been variously rendered by the Latin translators
by ab initio, initio, and in initiis. Those who rendered it in the plural, have followed the Greek phrase. But it is
more usual in the Latin tongue to express the idea conveyed by καταρχὰς, which in the Greek is used in the
plural or adverbially, by the words ab initio, or initio; just as with us, when we say, Otherwise I do this (alias hoc
facio), we seem to be using the plural of the feminine gender, whereas the word is an adverb, and signifies, at
another time.”—C.]

151. Let no man, set in Christ’s body, imagine these words to be alien from himself,
since in truth it is the whole body of Christ placed in this humble state that speaketh: “O
consider my humiliation, and deliver me: for I forget not Thy law” (ver. 153). In this place
we cannot understand any law of God so suitably, as that whereby it is immutably determined
that “every one that exalteth himself, shall be abased; and every one that humbleth himself;
shall be exalted.”5356
152. “Avenge Thou,” he saith, “my cause, and deliver me” (ver. 154). The former sentence
is here almost repeated. And what is there said, “For I do not forget Thy law,” agreeth with
what we read here, “Quicken me, according to Thy word.” For these words are the law of
God, which he hath not forgot, so that he hath abased himself, and will therefore be exalted.
But the words, “Quicken me,” pertain to this very exaltation; for the exaltation of the saints
is everlasting life.
153. “Health,” he saith, “is far from the ungodly: for they regard not Thy righteousnesses”
(ver. 155). This separateth thee, that what they have not done, thou hast done, that is, thou
hast regarded the righteousnesses of God. But “what hast thou that thou hast not re-
ceived?”5357 Art thou not he who a little before didst say, “I will keep Thy righteousnesses”?
Thou therefore hast received from Him, unto whom thou didst call, the power to keep them.
He therefore doth Himself separate thee from those from whom health is far, because they
have not regarded the righteousnesses of God.
154. This he saw himself also. For I should not see it, save I saw it in Him, save I were
in Him. For these are the words of the Body of Christ, whose members we are. He saw this,
I say, and at once added, “Great are Thy mercies, O Lord” (ver. 156). Even our seeking out
Thy righteousnesses, then, cometh of Thy mercies. “Quicken me according to Thy judgment.”
For I know that Thy judgments will not be upon me without Thy mercy.
155. “Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me; yet do I not swerve from Thy
testimonies” (ver. 157). This hath been realized: we know it, we recollect it, we acknowledge
it. The whole earth has been crimsoned by the blood of Martyrs; heaven is flowery with the
crowns of Martyrs, the Churches are adorned with the memorials of Martyrs, seasons dis-
tinguished by the birthdays of Martyrs, cures more frequent 5358 by the merits of Martyrs.
Whence this, save because that hath been fulfilled which was prophesied5359 of that Man
who hath been spread abroad around the whole world. We recognize this, and render thanks

to the Lord our God. For thou, man, thou hast thyself said in another Psalm, “If the Lord
Himself had not been on our side, they would have swallowed us up quick.”5360 Behold the
reason why thou hast not swerved from His testimonies, and hast won the palm of thy
heavenly calling amid the hands of the many who persecuted and troubled thee.
156. “I have seen,” he saith, “the foolish, and I pined” (ver. 158): or, as other copies read,
“I have seen them that keep not covenant:” this is the reading of most. But who are they
who have not kept covenant, save they who have swerved from the testimonies of God, not
bearing the tribulation of their many persecutors? Now this is the covenant, that he who
shall have conquered shall be crowned. They who, not bearing persecution, have by denial
swerved from the testimonies of God, have not kept the covenant. These then the Psalmist
saw, and pined, for he loved them. For that jealousy is good, springing from love, not from
envy. He addeth in what respect they had failed to keep the covenant, “Because they kept
not Thy word.” For this they denied in their tribulations.
157. And he commendeth himself as differing from them, and saith, “Behold, how I
have loved Thy commandments” (ver. 159). He saith not, I have not denied Thy words or
testimonies, as the Martyrs were urged to do, and, when they refused, suffered intolerable
torments: but he said this wherein is the fruit of all sufferings; for, “if I give up my body to
be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.”5361 The Psalmist, praising this
virtue, saith, “Behold, how I have loved Thy commandments.” Then he asketh his reward,
“O Lord, quicken me, according to Thy mercy.” These put me to death, do Thou quicken
me. But if a reward be asked of mercy, which justice is bound to give; how much greater is
that mercy, which enabled him to gain the victory, on account of which the reward was
sought for?
158. “The beginning,” he saith, “of Thy words is truth; all the judgments of Thy right-
eousness endure for evermore” (ver. 160). From truth, he saith, Thy words do proceed, and
they are therefore truthful, and deceive no man, for in them life is announced to the righteous,
punishment to the ungodly. These are the everlasting judgments of God’s righteousness.

159. We know what persecutions the body of Christ, that is, the holy Church, suffered
from the kings of the earth. Let us therefore here also recognise the words of the Church:
“Princes have persecuted me without a cause: and my heart hath stood in awe of Thee” (ver.
161). For how had the Christians injured the kingdoms of the earth, although their King
promised them the kingdom of heaven? How, I ask, had they injured the kingdoms of earth?
Did their King forbid His soldiers to pay and to render due service to the kings of the earth?
Saith He not to the Jews who were striving to calumniate Him, “Render unto Cæsar the
things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s”?5362 Did He not even in
His own Person pay tribute from the mouth of a fish?5363 Did not His forerunner, when
the soldiers of this kingdom were seeking what they ought to do for their everlasting salvation,
instead of replying, Loose your belts, throw away your arms, desert your king, that ye may
wage war for the Lord, answer, “Do violence to no man: neither accuse any falsely: and be
content with your wages”?5364 Did not one of His soldiers, His most beloved companion,5365
say to his fellow soldiers, the provincials,5366 so to speak, of Christ, “Let every soul be subject
unto the higher powers”?5367 Does he not enjoin the Church to pray for even kings them-
selves?5368 How then have the Christians offended against them? What due have they not
rendered? in what have not Christians obeyed the monarchs of earth? The kings of the earth
therefore have persecuted the Christians without a cause. They too had their threatening
words: I banish, I proscribe, I slay, I torture with claws, I burn with fires, I expose to beasts,
I tear the limbs piecemeal.5369 But heed what he hath subjoined: “And my heart hath stood
in awe of Thy word.” My heart hath stood in awe of these words,5370 “Fear not them that
kill the body,” etc. I have scorned man who persecuteth me, and have overcome the devil
that would seduce me.
160. Then follows, “I am as glad of Thy word as one that findeth great spoils” (ver. 162).
By the same words he conquered, of which he stood in awe. For spoils are stripped from
the conquered; as he was overcome and despoiled of whom it is said in the Gospel, “except
he first bind the strong man.”5371 But many spoils were found, when, admiring the endurance

of the Martyrs, even the persecutors believed; and they who had plotted to injure our King
by the injury of His soldiers, were gained over by Him in addition. Whoever therefore
standeth in awe of the words of God, fearing lest he be overcome in the contest, rejoiceth
as conqueror in the same words.
161. “As for iniquity, I hate and abhor it; but Thy law have I loved” (ver. 163). That awe,
therefore, of His word did not create hatred of those words, but maintained his love unim-
paired. For the words of God are no other than the law of God. Far be it therefore that love
perish through fear, where fear is chaste. Thus fathers are at once feared and loved by affec-
tionate sons; thus doth the chaste wife at once fear her husband, lest she be forsaken by him,
and loveth him, that she may enjoy his love. If then the human father and the human husband
desire at once to be feared and loved; much more doth our Father who is in heaven,5372 and
that Bridegroom, “beautiful beyond the sons of men,”5373 not in the flesh, but in goodness.
For by whom is the law of God loved, save by those by whom God is loved? And what that
is severe hath the father’s law to good sons?5374 Let the Father’s judgments therefore be
praised even in the scourge, if His promises be loved in the reward.
162. Such was, assuredly, the conduct of the Psalmist, who saith, “Seven times a day do
I praise Thee, because of Thy righteous judgments” (ver. 164). The words “seven times a
day,” signify “evermore.” For this number is wont to be a symbol of universality; because
after six days of the divine work of creation, a seventh of rest was added;5375 and all times
roll on through a revolving cycle of seven days. For no other reason it was said, “a just man
falleth seven times, and riseth up again:”5376 that is, the just man perisheth not, though
brought low in every way, yet not induced to transgress, otherwise he will not be just. For
the words, “falleth seven times,” are employed to express every kind of tribulation, whereby
man is cast down in the sight of men: and the words, “riseth up again,” signify that he
profiteth from all these tribulations. The following sentence in this passage sufficiently illus-
trates the foregoing words: for it follows, “but the wicked shall fall into mischief.” Not to be
deprived of strength in any evils, is therefore the falling seven times, and the rising again of
the just man. Justly hath the Church then praised God seven times in a day for His righteous
judgments; because, when it was time that judgment should begin at the house of God,5377
she did not faint in all her tribulations, but was glorified with the crowns of Martyrs.

163. “Great is the peace,” he saith, “that they have who love Thy law: and there is no
offence to them” (ver. 165). Doth this mean that the law itself is not an offence to them that
love it, or that there is no offence from any source unto them that love the law? But both
senses are rightly understood. For he who loveth the law of God, honoureth in it even what
he doth not understand; and what seemeth to him to sound absurd, he judgeth rather that
he doth not understand, and that there is some great meaning hidden: thus the law of God
is not an offence to him…
164. “I have waited,” he saith, “for Thy saving health, O Lord, and have loved Thy
commandments” (ver. 166). For what would it have profited the righteous of old to have
loved the commandments of God, save Christ, who is the saving health of God, had freed
them; by the gift of whose Spirit also they were able to love the commandments of God? If
therefore they who loved God’s commandments, waited for His saving health; how much
more necessary was Jesus, that is, the saving Health of God, for the salvation of those that
did not love His commandments? This prophecy may suit also the Saints of the period since
the revelation of grace, and the preaching of the Gospel, for they that love God’s command-
ments look for Christ, that “when Christ, our life, shall appear, we” may then “appear with
Him in glory.”5378
165. “My soul hath kept Thy testimonies, and I have loved them exceedingly:” or, as
some copies read, “hath loved them,” understanding, “my soul” (ver. 167). The testimonies
of God are kept, while they are not denied. This is the office of Martyrs, for testimonies are
called Martyria in Greek. But since it profiteth nothing, even to be burnt with flames without
charity,5379 he addeth, “and I have loved them exceedingly.”…For he who loveth, keepeth
them in the Spirit of truth and faithfulness. But generally, while the commandments of God
are kept, they against whose will they are kept become our foes: then, indeed, His testimonies
also must be kept courageously, lest they be denied when the enemy persecuteth. After the
Psalmist, then, had declared that he had done both these things, he ascribeth unto God his
having been enabled to do so, by adding, “because all my ways are in Thy sight.” He saith
therefore, “I have kept Thy commandments and Thy testimonies; because all my ways are
in Thy sight” (ver. 168). As much as to say, Hadst Thou turned away Thy face from me, I
should have been confounded, nor could I keep Thy commandments and testimonies. “I
have kept them,” then, because “all my ways are in Thy sight.” With a look favouring and
aiding man, he meant it to be understood that God seeth his ways: according to the prayer,
“O hide not Thou Thy face from me.”5380…

recognise ourselves, if we be not reprobate, among the members of this one praying. “Let
my prayer come near in Thy sight, O Lord” (ver. 169): for, “The Lord is nigh unto them that
are of a contrite heart.”5381 “Give me understanding, according to Thy word.” He claimeth
a promise. For he saith, “according to Thy word,” which is to say, according to Thy promise.
For the Lord promised this when He said, “I will inform thee.”5382
167. “Let my request come before Thy presence, O Lord: deliver me, according to Thy
word” (ver. 170). He repeateth what he hath asked. For his former words, “Let my prayer
come near in Thy presence, O Lord:” are like unto what he saith, “Let my request come before
Thy presence, O Lord:” and the words, “Give me understanding according to Thy word,”
agree with these, “Deliver me according to Thy word.” For by receiving understanding he
is delivered, who of himself through want of understanding is deceived.
168. “My lips shall burst forth praise: when Thou hast taught me Thy righteousnesses”
(ver. 171). We know how God teacheth those who are docile unto God. For every one who
hath heard from the Father and hath learned, comes unto Him “who justifieth the un-
godly:”5383 so that he may keep the righteousnesses of God not only by retaining them in
his memory, but also by doing them. Thus doth he who glorieth, glory not in himself, but
in the Lord,5384 and burst forth praise.
169. But as he hath now learned, and praised God his Teacher, he next wisheth to teach.
“Yea, my tongue shall declare Thy word: for all Thy commandments are righteousness”
(ver. 172). When he saith that he will declare these things, he becometh a minister of the
word. For though God teach within, nevertheless “faith cometh from hearing: and how do
they hear without a preacher?”5385 For, because “God giveth the increase,”5386 is no reason
why we need not plant and water.
170. “Let Thy hand be stretched forth (fiat, be made) to save me, for I have chosen Thy
commandments” (ver. 173). That I might not fear, and that not only might my heart hold
fast, but my tongue also utter Thy words: “I have chosen Thy commandments,” and have
stifled fear with love. Let Thy hand therefore be stretched forth, to save me from another’s
hand. Thus God saved the Martyrs, when He permitted them not to be slain in their souls:
for “vain is the safety of man”5387 in the flesh. The words, “Let Thy hand be made,” may

also be taken to mean Christ the Hand of God…Certainly where we read the following
words, “I have longed for Thy salvation, O Lord” (ver. 174): even if all our foes be reluctant,
let Christ the Salvation of God occur to us: the righteous men of old confess that they longed
for Him, the Church longed for His destined coming from His mother’s womb, the Church
longeth for His coming at His Father’s right hand. Subjoined to this sentence are the words,
“And Thy law is my meditation:” for the Law giveth testimony unto Christ.
171. But in this faith, though the heathen rage furiously, and the people imagine a vain
thing:5388 though the flesh be slain while it preacheth Thee: “My soul shall live, and shall
praise Thee: and Thy judgments shall help me” (ver. 175). These are those judgments, which
it was time should begin at the house of the Lord.5389 But “they will help me,” he saith. And
who cannot see how much the blood of the Church hath aided the Church? how great a
harvest hath risen in the whole world from that sowing?
172. At last he openeth himself completely, and showeth what person was speaking
throughout the whole Psalm. “I have gone astray,” he saith, “like a sheep that is lost: O
seek5390 Thy servant, for I do not forget Thy commandments” (ver. 176). Let the lost sheep
be sought, let the lost sheep be quickened, for whose sake its Shepherd left the ninety and
nine in the wilderness,5391 and while seeking it, was torn by Jewish thorns. But it is still being
sought, let it still be sought, partly found let it still be sought. For as to that company, among
whom the Psalmist saith, “I do not forget Thy commandments,” it hath been found; but
through those who choose the commandments of God, gather them together, love them, it
is still sought, and by means of the blood of its Shepherd shed and sprinkled abroad, it is
found in all nations.5392

required it of me, to whom I owed this office. That I have said nothing of the Hebrew alphabet, in which every
eight verses are ranged under a particular letter, and the whole Psalm arranged in this manner, let no one wonder,
since I found nothing that related especially to the Psalm: for it is not the only one which hath these letters. Let
those who cannot find it in the Latin and Greek versions, since it is not adopted there, know that every set of
eight verses in the Hebrew copies beginneth with that letter which is prefixed to them; as is indicated to us by
those who are acquainted with the Hebrew tongue. This is done with much more care than our writers have
Tau.
Psalm CXX.5393
1. The Psalm which we have just heard chanted, and have responded to with our voices,
is short, and very profitable. Ye will not long toil in hearing, nor will ye toil fruitlessly in
working. For it is, according to the title prefixed to it, “A song of degrees.”5394 Degrees are
either of ascent or of descent. But degrees, as they are used in this Psalm, are of ascend-
ing…There are therefore both those who ascend and those who descend on that ladder.5395
Who are they that ascend? They who progress towards the understanding of things spiritual.
Who are they that descend? They who, although, as far as men may, they enjoy the compre-
hension of things spiritual: nevertheless, descend unto the infants, to say to them such things
as they can receive, so that, after being nourished with milk, they may become fitted and
strong enough to take spiritual meat…
2. When therefore a man hath commenced thus to order his ascent; to speak more
plainly, when a Christian hath begun to think of spiritual amendment, he beginneth to
suffer the tongues of adversaries. Whoever hath not yet suffered from them, hath not yet
made progress; whoever suffereth them not, doth not even endeavour to improve. Doth he
wish to know what we mean? Let him at the same time experience what is reported of us.
Let him begin to improve, let him begin to wish to ascend, to wish to despise earthly, fragile,
temporal objects, to hold worldly happiness for nothing, to think of God alone, not to rejoice
in gain, not to pine at losses, to wish even to sell all his substance, and distribute it among
the poor, and to follow Christ; let us see how he suffereth the tongues of detractors and of
constant opponents, and—a still greater peril—of pretended counsellors, who lead him
astray from salvation…He then, who will ascend, first of all prayeth God against these very
tongues: for he saith, “When I was in trouble, I called on the Lord; and He heard me” (ver.
1). Why did He hear him? That He might now place him at the steps of ascent.
3. “Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unrighteous lips, and from a deceitful tongue” (ver.
2). What is a deceitful tongue? A treacherous tongue, one that hath the semblance of counsel,
and the bane of real mischief. Such are those who say, And wilt thou do this, that nobody
doth? Wilt thou be the only Christian?…Some deter by dissuasion, others discourage yet
more by their praise. For since such is the life that hath for some time been diffused over
the world, so great is the authority of Christ, that not even a pagan ventureth to blame
shown in their Latin or Punic compositions of Psalms which they style abecedarii. For they do not begin all the
verses down to the close of a period, but the first only with the same letter which they prefix to it.” It was the
counsel of the learned general editor to drop this Psalm entirely. For the sake of preserving the symmetry of the
work, I have retained as much as I could.—C.]

Christ.5396 He who cannot be censured is read. They cannot contradict Christ, they cannot
contradict the Gospel, Christ cannot be censured; the deceitful tongue turneth itself to praise
as an hindrance. If thou praisest, exhort. Why dost thou discourage with thy praise?…Thou
turnest thyself to another mode of dissuasion, that by false praise thou mayest turn me away
from true praise;5397 nay, that by praising Christ thou mayest keep me away from Christ,
saying, What is this? Behold these men have done this: thou, perhaps, wilt not be able: thou
beginnest to ascend, thou fallest. It seemeth to warn thee: it is the serpent, it is the deceitful
tongue, it hath poison. Pray against it, if thou wishest to ascend.
4. And thy Lord saith unto thee, “What shall be given thee, or what shall be set before
thee, against the deceitful tongue?” (ver. 3). What shall be given thee, that is, as a weapon
to oppose to the deceitful tongue, to guard thyself against the deceitful tongue? “Or what
shall be set before thee?” He asketh to try thee: for He will answer His own question. For
He answers following up his own inquiry, “even sharp arrows of the Mighty One, with coals
that desolate, or that lay waste” (ver. 4). They that desolate, or that lay waste (for it is variously
written in different copies), are the same, because by laying waste, as ye may observe, they
easily lead unto desolation. What are these coals? First, beloved brethren, understand what
are arrows. The “sharp arrows of the Mighty One,” are the words of God…What then are
the “coals that lay waste?” It is not enough to plead with words against a deceitful tongue
and unrighteous lips: it is not enough to plead with words; we must plead with examples
also…The word coals, then, is used to express the examples of many sinners converted to
the Lord. Thou hearest men wonder, and say, I knew that man, how addicted he was to
drinking, what a villain, what a lover of the circus, or of the amphitheatre, what a cheat:
now how he serveth God, how innocent he hath become! Wonder not; he is a live coal. Thou
rejoicest that he is alive, whom thou wast mourning as dead. But when thou praisest the
living, if thou knowest how to praise, apply him to the dead, that he may be inflamed;
whosoever is still slow to follow God, apply to him the coal which was extinguished, and
have the arrow of God’s word, and the coal that layeth waste, that thou mayest meet the
deceitful tongue and the lying lips.
5. “Alas, that my sojourning is become far off!” (ver. 5). It hath departed far from Thee:
my pilgrimage hath become a far one. I have not yet reached that country, where I shall live
with no wicked person; I have not yet reached that company of Angels, where I shall not
fear offences. But why am I not as yet there? Because sojourning is pilgrimage. He is called
a sojourner who dwells in a foreign land, not in his own country. And when is it far off?
Sometimes, my brethren, when a man goeth abroad, he liveth among better persons, than
he would perhaps live with in his own country: but it is not thus, when we go afar from that
5396 [Noteworthy.—C.]
5397 [The stratagem of those who glorify Jesus as a man, to deny His true character as Christ.—C.]
Psalm CXX
heavenly Jerusalem. For a man changeth his country, and this foreign sojourn is sometimes
good for him; in travelling he findeth faithful friends, whom he could not find in his own
country. He had enemies, so that he was driven from his country; and when he travelled,
he found what he had not in his country. Such is not that country Jerusalem, where all are
good: whoever travelleth away from thence, is among the evil; nor can he depart from the
wicked, save when he shall return to the company of Angels, so as to be where he was before
he travelled. There all are righteous and holy, who enjoy the word of God without reading,
without letters: for what is written to us through pages,5398 they perceive there through the
Face of God. What a country! A great country indeed, and wretched are the wanderers from
that country.
6. But what he saith, “My pilgrimage hath been made distant,” are the words of those,
that is, of the Church herself, who toileth on this earth. It is her voice, which crieth out from
the ends of the earth in another Psalm, saying, “From the ends of the earth have I cried unto
Thee.5399…Where then doth he groan, and among whom doth he dwell? “I have had my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.” Since this is a Hebrew word, beyond doubt ye have
not understood it. What meaneth, “I have had my habitation among the tents of Kedar”?
“Kedar,” as far as we remember of the interpretation of Hebrew words, signifieth darkness.
“Kedar” rendered into Latin is called tenebræ. Now ye know that Abraham had two sons,
whom indeed the Apostle mentioneth, 5400 and declareth them to have been types of the
two covenants…Ishmael therefore was in darkness, Isaac in light. Whoever here also seek
earthly felicity in the Church, from God, shall belong to Ishmael. These are the very persons
who gainsay the spiritual ones who are progressing, and detract from them, and have deceitful
tongues and unrighteous lips. Against these the Psalmist, when ascending, prayed, and hot
coals that lay waste, and swift and sharp arrows of the Mighty One, were given him for his
defence. For among these he still liveth, until the whole floor be winnowed: he therefore
said, “I have dwelt among the tents of Kedar.” The tents of Ishmael are called those of Kedar.
Thus the book of Genesis hath it: thus it hath, that Kedar belongeth unto Ishmael.5401 Isaac
therefore is with Ishmael: that is, they who belong unto Isaac, live among those who belong
unto Ishmael.5402 These wish to rise above, those wish to press them downwards: these wish
to fly unto God, those endeavour to pluck their wings…
7. “My soul hath wandered much” (ver. 6). Lest thou shouldest understand bodily
wandering, he hath said that the soul wandered. The body wandereth in places, the soul

wandereth in its affections. If thou love the earth, thou wanderest from God: if thou lovest
God, thou risest unto God. Let us be exercised in the love of God, and of our neighbour,
that we may return unto charity. If we fall towards the earth, we wither and decay. But one
descended unto this one who had fallen, in order that he might arise. Speaking of the time
of his wandering, he said that he wandered in the tents of Kedar. Wherefore? Because “my
soul hath wandered much.” He wandereth there where he ascendeth. He wandereth not in
the body, he riseth not in the body. But wherein doth he ascend? “The ascent,” he saith, “is
in the heart.”5403
8. “With them that hated peace, I was peaceful” (ver. 7). But howsoever ye may hear,
most beloved brethren, ye will not be able to prove how truly ye sing, unless ye have begun
to do that which ye sing. How much soever I say this, in whatsoever ways I may expound
it, in whatsoever words I may turn it, it entereth not into the heart of him in whom its oper-
ation is not. Begin to act, and see what we speak. Then tears flow forth at each word, then
the Psalm is sung, and the heart doeth what is sung in the Psalm…Who are they who hate
peace? They who tear asunder unity. For had they not hated peace, they would have abode
in unity. But they separated themselves, forsooth on this account, that they might be right-
eous, that they might not have the ungodly mixed with them. These words are either ours
or theirs: decide whose. The Catholic Church saith, Unity must not be lost, the Church of
God must not be cut off.5404 God will judge afterwards of the wicked and the good…This
we also say: Love ye peace, love ye Christ. For if they love peace, they love Christ. When
therefore we say, Love ye peace, we say this, Love ye Christ. Wherefore? For the Apostle
saith of Christ, “He is our peace, who hath made both one.”5405 If Christ is therefore peace,
because He hath made both one: why have ye made two of one? How then are ye peace-
makers, if, when Christ maketh one of two, ye make two of one? But since we say these
things, we are peace-makers with them that hate peace; and yet they who hate peace, when
we spake to them, made war on us for nought.

Psalm CXX
Psalm CXXI.5406
1. …Let them “lift up their eyes to the hills whence cometh their help” (ver. 1). What
meaneth, The hills have been lightened? The San of righteousness hath already risen, the
Gospel hath been already preached by the Apostles, the Scriptures have been preached, all
the mysteries have been laid open, the veil hath been rent, the secret place of the temple
hath been revealed: let them now at length lift their eyes up to the hills, whence their help
cometh…“Of His fulness have all we received,”5407 he saith. Thy help therefore is from
Him, of whose fulness the hills received, not from the hills;5408 towards which,5409 never-
theless, save thou lift thine eyes through the Scriptures, thou wilt not approach, so as to be
lighted by Him.5410
2. Sing therefore what followeth; if thou wish to hear how thou mayest most securely
set thy feet on the steps, so that thou mayest not be fatigued in that ascent, nor stumble and
fall: pray in these words: “Suffer not my foot to be moved!” (ver. 3). Whereby are feet moved;
whereby was the foot of him who was in Paradise moved? But first consider whereby the
feet of him who was among the Angels were moved: who when his feet were moved fell,
and from an Angel became a devil: for when his feet were moved he fell. Seek whereby he
fell: he fell through pride. Nothing then moveth the feet, save pride: nothing moveth the
feet to a fall, save pride. Charity moveth them to walk and to improve and to ascend; pride
moveth them to fall…Rightly therefore the Psalmist, hearing how he may ascend and may
not fall, prayeth unto God that he may profit from the vale of misery, and may not fail in
the swelling of pride, in these words, “Suffer not my feet to be moved!” And He replieth
unto him, “Let him that keepeth thee not sleep.” Attend, my beloved. It is as if one thought
were expressed in two sentences; the man while ascending and singing “the song of degrees,”
saith, “Suffer not my foot to be moved:” and it is as if God answered, Thou sayest unto Me,
Let not my feet be moved: say also, “Let Him that keepeth thee not sleep,” and thy foot shall
not be moved.
3. Choose for thyself Him, who will neither sleep nor slumber, and thy foot shall not be
moved. God is never asleep: if thou dost wish to have a keeper who never sleepeth, choose

Psalm CXXI
Psalm CXXI
God for thy keeper. “Suffer not my feet to be moved,” thou sayest: well, very well: but He
also saith unto thee, “Let not him that keepeth thee slumber.” Thou perhaps wast about to
turn thyself unto men as thy keepers, and to say, whom shall I find who will not sleep? what
man will not slumber? whom do I find? whither shall I go? whither shall I return? The
Psalmist telleth thee: “He that keepeth Israel, shall neither slumber nor sleep” (ver. 4). Dost
thou wish to have a keeper who neither slumbereth nor sleepeth? Behold, “He that keepeth
Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep:” for Christ keepeth Israel. Be thou then Israel. What
meaneth Israel? It is interpreted, Seeing God. And how is God seen? First by faith: afterwards
by sight. If thou canst not as yet see Him by sight, see Him by faith…Who is there, who will
neither slumber nor sleep? when thou seekest among men, thou art deceived; thou wilt
never find one. Trust not then in any man: every man slumbereth, and will sleep. When
doth he slumber? When he beareth the flesh of weakness. When will he sleep? When he is
dead. Trust not then in man. A mortal may slumber, he sleepeth in death. Seek not a keeper
among men.
4. And who, thou askest, shall help me, save He who slumbereth not, nor sleepeth? Hear
what followeth: “The Lord Himself is thy keeper” (ver. 5). It is not therefore man, that
slumbereth and sleepeth, but the Lord, that keepeth thee. How doth He keep thee? “The
Lord is thy defence upon the hand of thy right hand.”…It seemeth to me to have a hidden
sense: otherwise he would have simply said, without qualification, “The Lord will keep thee,”
without adding, “on thy right hand.” For how? Doth God keep our right hand, and not our
left? Did He not create the whole of us? Did not He who made our right hand, make our
left hand also? Finally, if it pleased Him to speak of the right hand alone, why said He, “on
the hand of thy right hand,” and not at once “upon thy right hand”? Why should He say
this, unless He were keeping somewhat here hidden for us to arrive at by knocking? For He
would either say, “The Lord shall keep thee,” and add no more; or if He would add the right
hand, “The Lord shall keep thee upon thy right hand;” or at least, as He added “hand,” He
would say, “The Lord shall keep thee upon thy hand, even thy right hand,”5411 not “upon
the hand of thy right hand.”…
5. I ask you, how ye interpret what is said in the Gospel, “Let not your left hand know
what your right hand doeth”?5412 For if ye understand this, ye will discover what is your
right hand, and what is your left: at the same time ye will also understand that God made
both hands, the left and the right; yet the left ought not to know what the right doeth. By
our left hand is meant all that we have in a temporal way; by our right hand is meant,
whatever our Lord promiseth us that is immutable and eternal. But if He who will give
5411 Manum dexteram.
5412 Matt. vi. 3.
Psalm CXXI
everlasting life, Himself also consoleth our present life by these temporal blessings, He hath
Himself made our right hand and our left…
6. Let us now come to this verse of the Psalm: “The Lord is thy defence upon the hand
of thy right hand” (ver. 5). By hand he meaneth power. How do we prove this? Because the
power of God also is styled the hand of God…Whereof John saith, “He gave unto them
power to become the sons of God.”5413 Whence hast thou received this power? “To them,”
he saith, “that believe in His Name.” If then thou believest, this very power is given thee, to
be among the sons of God. But to be among the sons of God, is to belong to the right hand.
Thy faith therefore is the hand of thy right hand: that is, the power that is given thee, to be
among the sons of God, is the hand of thy right hand…
7. “May the Lord shield thee upon the hand of thy right hand” (ver. 6). I have said, and
I believe ye have recognised it. For had ye not recognised it, and that from the Scriptures,
ye would not signify your understanding of it by your voices.5414 Since then ye have under-
stood, brethren, consider what followeth; wherefore the Lord shieldeth thee “upon the hand
of thy right hand,” that is, in thy faith, wherein we have received “power to become the sons
of God,” and to be on His right hand: wherefore should God shield us? On account of of-
fences. Whence come offences? Offences are to be feared from two quarters, for there are
two precepts upon which the whole Law hangeth and the Prophets, the love of God and of
our neighbour.5415 The Church is loved for the sake of our neighbour, but God for the sake
of God. Of God, is understood the sun figuratively: of the Church, is understood the moon
figuratively. Whoever can err, so as to think otherwise of God than he ought, believing not
the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost to be of one Substance, has been deceived by
the cunning of heretics, chiefly of the Arians. If he hath believed anything less in the Son or
in the Holy Spirit than in the Father, he hath suffered an offence in God; he is scorched by
the sun. Whoever again believeth that the Church existeth in one province only,5416 and
not that she is diffused over the whole world, and whoso believeth them that say, “Lo here,”
and “Lo there, is Christ,”5417 as ye but now heard when the Gospel was being read; since
He who gave so great a price, purchased the whole world: he is offended, so to speak, in his
neighbour, and is burnt by the moon. Whoever therefore erreth in the very Substance of
Truth, is burnt by the sun, and is burnt through the day; because he erreth in Wisdom it-
self…God therefore hath made one sun, which riseth upon the good and the evil, that sun

which the good and the evil see; but that Sun is another one, not created, not born, through
whom all things were made;5418 where is the intelligence of the Immutable Truth: of this
the ungodly say, “the Sun rose not upon us.”5419 Whosoever erreth not in Wisdom itself,
is not burnt by the sun. Whosoever erreth not in the Church, and in the Lord’s Flesh, and
in those things which were done for us in time, is not burnt by the moon. But every man
although he believeth in Christ, erreth either in this or that respect, unless what is here
prayed for, “The Lord is thy defence upon the hand of thy right hand,” is realized in him.
He goeth on to say, “So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, nor the moon by night” (ver.
6). Thy defence, therefore, is upon the hand of thy right hand for this reason, that the sun
may not burn thee by day, nor the moon by night. Understand hence, brethren, that it is
spoken figuratively. For, in truth, if we think of the visible sun, it burneth by day: doth the
moon burn by night? But what is burning? Offence. Hear the Apostle’s words: “Who is
weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?”5420
8. “For the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil” (ver. 7). From offences in the sun,
from offences in the moon, from all evil shall He preserve thee, who is thy defence upon the
hand of thy right hand, who will not sleep nor slumber. And for what reason? Because we
are amid temptations: “The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. The Lord preserve thy
soul:” even thy very soul. “The Lord preserve thy going out and thy coming in, from this
time forth for evermore” (ver. 8). Not thy body; for the Martyrs were consumed in the body:
but “the Lord preserve thy soul;” for the Martyrs yielded not up their souls. The persecutors
raged against Crispina,5421 whose birthday we are to-day celebrating; they were raging
against a rich and delicate woman: but she was strong, for the Lord was her defence upon

knoweth her not? For she was most illustrious, noble in birth, abounding in wealth: but all
these things were in her left hand, beneath her head. An enemy advanced to strike her head,

spoken. ‘The Son of God,’ he saith, ‘is of the Father alone, neither made, nor created, but begotten;’” whence
Possevinus, Torrensis, and Bellarmine have quoted St. Augustin as assigning the Athanasian Creed to St. Ath-
anasius. But Petavius, Theol. Dogm. de Trin. l. vii. c. 8, note 7, says the words have been foisted into St. Augustin,
and in fact they are not in any of our mss. nor in the editions of Amsterdam, of Erasmus, and of Louvain.—Ben.
Some other additions are mentioned in the Benedictine notes on this Psalm, but they seem of later date than St.
Augustin.

Psalm CXXI
Psalm CXXII.5423
1. As impure love inflames the mind, and summons the soul destined to perish to lust
for earthly things, and to follow what is perishable, and precipitates it into lowest places,
and sinks it into the abyss; so holy love raiseth us to heavenly things, and inflames us to
what is eternal, and excites the soul to those things which do not pass away nor die, and
from the abyss of hell raiseth it to heaven. Yet all love hath a power of its own, nor can love
in the soul of the lover be idle; it must needs draw it on. But dost thou wish to know of what
sort love is? See whither it leadeth…
2. This Psalm is a “Song of degrees;”5424 as we have often said to you, for these de-
grees5425 are not of descent, but of ascent. He therefore longeth to ascend. And whither
doth he wish to ascend, save into heaven? What meaneth, into heaven? Doth he wish to as-
cend that he may be with the sun, moon, and stars? Far be it! But there is in heaven the
eternal Jerusalem, where are our fellow-citizens, the Angels: we are wanderers on earth from
these our fellow-citizens. We sigh in our pilgrimage; we shall rejoice in the city. But we find
companions in this pilgrimage, who have already seen this city herself; who summon us to
run towards her. At these he also rejoiceth, who saith, “I rejoiced in them who said unto
me, We will go into the house of the Lord” (ver. 1)…
3. “Our feet were standing in the courts of Jerusalem” (ver. 2)…Consider what thou
wilt be there; and although thou art as yet on the road, place this before thine eyes, as if thou
wert already standing, as if thou wert already rejoicing without ceasing among the Angels;
as if that which is written were realized in thee: “Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house;
they will be alway praising Thee.”5426 “Our feet stood in the courts of Jerusalem.” What
Jerusalem? This earthly Jerusalem also is wont to be called by the name: though this Jerusalem
is but the shadow of that. And what great thing is it to stand in this Jerusalem, since this
Jerusalem hath not been able to stand, but hath been turned into a ruin? Doth then the Holy
Spirit pronounce this, out of the kindled heart of the loving Psalmist, as a great thing? Is
not it that Jerusalem, unto whom the Lord said, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest
the Prophets,” etc.5427 What great thing then did he desire; to stand among those who slew
the Prophets, and stoned them that were sent unto them? God forbid that he should think
of that Jerusalem, who so loveth, who so burneth, who so longeth to reach that Jerusalem,
“our Mother,”5428 of which the Apostle saith, that She is “eternal in the Heavens.”5429

Psalm CXXII
Psalm CXXII
4. “Jerusalem that is being built as a city” (ver. 3). Brethren, when David was uttering
these words, that city had been finished, it was not being built. It is some city he speaketh
of, therefore, which is now being built, unto which living stones run in faith, of whom Peter
saith, “Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house;”5430 that is, the holy temple
of God. What meaneth, ye are built up as lively stones? Thou livest, if thou believest: but if
thou believest, thou art made a temple of God; for the Apostle Paul saith, “The temple of
God is holy, which temple are ye.”5431 This city is therefore now in building; stones are cut
down from the hills by the hands of those who preach truth, they are squared that they may
enter into an everlasting structure. There are still many stones in the hands of the Builder:
let them not fall from His hands, that they may be built perfect into the structure of the
temple. This, then, is the “Jerusalem that is being built as a city:” Christ is its foundation.
The Apostle Paul saith, “Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ
Jesus.”5432 When a foundation is laid on earth, the walls are built above, and the weight of
the walls tends towards the lowest parts, because the foundation is laid at the bottom. But
if our foundation be in heaven, let us be built towards heaven. Bodies have built the edifice
of this basilica,5433 the ample size of which ye see; and since bodies have built it, they placed
the foundation lowest: but since we are spiritually built, our foundation is placed at the
highest point. Let us therefore run thither, where we may be built…But what Jerusalem do
I speak of? Is it that, he asketh, which ye see standing, raised on the structure of its walls?
No; but the “Jerusalem which is being built as a city.” Why not, a city, instead of, “as a city;”
save because those walls, so built in Jerusalem, were a visible city, as it is by all called a city,
literally; but this is being built “as a city,” for they who enter it are like living stones; for they
are not literally stones? Just as they are called stones, and yet are not so: so the city styled
“as a city,” is not a city; for he said, “is being built.” For by the word building, he meant to
be understood the structure, and cohesion of bodies and walls. For a city 5434 is properly
understood of the men that inhabit there. But in saying “is building,” he showed us that he
meant a town. And since a spiritual building hath some resemblance to a bodily building,
therefore it “is building as a city.”
5. But let the following words remove all doubt that we ought not to understand carnally
the words, “Whose partaking is in the same.”5435…What meaneth, “the same”? What is

Psalm CXXII
ever in the same state; not what is now in one state, now in another. What then is, “the
same,” save that which is? What is that which is? That which is everlasting…Behold “The
Same: I Am that I Am, I AM.” Thou canst not understand; it is much to understand, it is
much to apprehend. Remember what He, whom thou canst not comprehend, became for
thee. Remember the flesh of Christ, towards which thou wast raised when sick, and when
left half dead from the wounds of robbers, that thou mightest be brought to the Inn, and
there mightest be cured.5436 Let us therefore run unto the Lord’s house, and reach the city
where our feet may stand; the city “that is building as a city: whose partaking is in The
Same.”…
6. That city “which partaketh in the same,” partaketh in its stability: justly therefore,
since he is made a sharer in its stability, saith he who runneth thither. For all things there
stand where nought passeth by. Dost thou too wish to stand there and not to pass by? Run
thither. Nobody hath “the same” from himself…
7. “For thither the tribes went up” (ver. 4). We were asking whither he ascendeth who
hath fallen; for we said, it is the voice of a man who is ascending, of the Church rising. Can
we tell whither it ascendeth? whither it goeth? whither it is raised? “Thither,” he saith, “the
tribes went up.” Whither? To “partaking in the Same.” But what are the tribes? Many know,
many know not. For if we use the word “curies” in its proper sense, we understand nothing,
save the “curies” which exist in each particular city, whence the terms “curiales” and “decu-
riones,” that is, the citizens of a curia or a decuria; and ye know that each city hath such
curies. But there are, or were at one time, curies of the people in those cities, and one city
hath many curies, as Rome hath thirty-five curies of the people.5437 These are called tribes.
The people of Israel had twelve of these, according to the sons of Jacob.
8. There were twelve tribes of the people of Israel: but there were good, and there were
bad among them. For how evil were those tribes which crucified our Lord! How good those
who recognised the Lord! Those tribes then who crucified the Lord, were tribes of the devil.
When therefore he here said, “For thither the tribes go up;” that thou mightest not understand
all the tribes, he added, “even the tribes of the Lord.”…What are the tribes of the Lord? “A
testimony unto Israel.” Hear, brethren, what this meaneth. “A testimony to Israel:” that is,
whereby it may be known that it is truly Israel…He is such in whom there is no guile. And
what did the Lord say, when He saw Nathanael? “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
guile.”5438 If therefore he is a true Israelite, in whom there is no guile, those tribes go up to
5436 Luke x. 30, 34.
5437 Thirty, according to Liv. i. 13, Cic. De Rep. ii. 8; thirty-five afterwards, according to Sext. Pomp. in v.
Curia, who seems to confound them with the “Tribes.” See Pollet, Hist. For. Rom. in Poleni Supplem. t. i. p. 516.
5438 John i. 47.
Psalm CXXII
Jerusalem, in whom there is no guile.…Wherefore do they go up? “To confess unto Thy
Name, O Lord.” It could not be more nobly expressed. As pride presumeth, so doth humility
confess. As he is a presumer, who wishes to appear what he is not, so is he a confessor, who
does not wish that to be seen which himself is, and loves That which He is. To this therefore
do Israelites go up, in whom is no guile, because they are truly Israelites, because in them
is the testimony of Israel.
9. “For there were seated seats for judgment” (ver. 5). This is a wonderful riddle, a
wonderful question, if it be not understood. He calleth those seats, which the Greeks call
thrones. The Greeks call chairs thrones, as a term of honour. Therefore, my brethren, it is
not wonderful if even we should sit on seats, or chairs; but that these seats themselves should
sit, when shall we be able to understand this? As if some one should say: let stools or chairs
sit here. We sit on chairs, we sit on seats, we sit on stools; the seats themselves sit not. What
then meaneth this, “For there were seated seats for judgment”?…If therefore heaven be the
seat of God, and the Apostles are heaven; they themselves are become the seat of God, the
throne of God. It is said in another passage:5439 “The soul of the righteous is the throne of
wisdom.” A great truth, a great truth, is declared; the throne of wisdom is the soul of the
righteous; that is, wisdom sitteth in the soul of the righteous as it were in her chair, in her
throne, and thence judgeth whatsoever she judgeth. There were therefore thrones of wisdom,
and therefore the Lord said unto them, “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.”5440 So they also shall sit upon twelve seats, and they are themselves the
seats of God; for of them it is said, “For there were seated seats.” Who sat? “Seats.” And who
are the seats? They of whom it is said, “The soul of the righteous is the seat of wisdom.”
Who are the seats? The heavens. Who are the heavens? Heaven. What is heaven? That of
which the Lord saith, “Heaven is My seat.”5441 The righteous then themselves are the seats;
and have seats; and seats shall be seated in that Jerusalem. For what purpose? “For judgment.”
Ye shall sit, He saith, on twelve thrones, O ye thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Judging whom? Those who are below on earth. Who will judge? They who have become
heaven. But they who shall be judged, will be divided into two bodies: one will be on the
right hand, the other on the left…
10. He at once addeth, as unto the seats themselves, “Enquire ye the things that are for
the peace of Jerusalem” (ver. 6). O ye seats, who now sit unto judgment, and are made the
seats of the Lord who judgeth (since they who judge, enquire; they who are judged, are en-
quired of), “Enquire ye,” he saith, “the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem.” What will

thus, “—?”—C.]
5440 Matt. xix. 28.
5441 Isa. lxvi. 1.
Psalm CXXII
they find by asking? That some have done deeds of charity, that others have not. Those
whom they shall find to have done deeds of charity, they will summon them unto Jerusalem;
for these deeds are “for the peace of Jerusalem.” Love is a powerful thing, my brethren, love
is a powerful thing. Do ye wish to see how powerful a thing love is?…If charity be destitute
of means, so that it cannot find what to bestow upon the poor, let it love: let it give “one cup
of cold water;”5442 as much shall be laid to its account, as to Zaccheus who gave half his
patrimony to the poor.5443 Wherefore this? The one gave so little, the other so much, and
shall so much be imputed to the former? Just so much. For though his resources are unequal,
his charity is not unequal.
11. …“And plenteousness,” he addeth, “for them that love thee.” He addresses Jerusalem
herself, They have plenteousness who love her. Plenteousness after want: here they are des-
titute, there they are affluent; here they are weak, there they are strong; here they want, there
they are rich. How have they become rich? Because they gave here what they received from
God for a season, and received there what God will afterwards pay back for evermore. Here,
my brethren, even rich men are poor. It is a good thing for a rich man to acknowledge
himself poor: for if he think himself full, that is mere puffing, not plenteousness. Let him
own himself empty, that he may be filled. What hath he? Gold. What hath he not yet?
Everlasting life. Let him consider what he hath, and see what he hath not. Brethren, of that
which he hath, let him give, that he may receive what he hath not; let him purchase out of
that which he hath, that which he hath not, “and plenteousness for them that love thee.”
12. “Peace be in thy strength” (ver. 7). O Jerusalem, O city, who art being built as a city,
whose partaking is in “The Same:” “Peace be in thy strength:” peace be in thy love; for thy
strength is thy love. Hear the Song of songs: “Love is strong as death.”5444 A great saying
that, brethren, “Love is strong as death.” The strength of charity could not be expressed in
grander terms than these, “Love is strong as death.” For who resisteth death, my brethren?
Consider, my brethren. Fire, waves, the sword, are resisted: we resist principalities, we resist
kings; death cometh alone, who resisteth it? There is nought more powerful than it. Charity
therefore is compared with its strength, in the words, “Love is strong as death.” And since
this love slayeth what we have been, that we may be what we were not; love createth a sort
of death in us. This death he had died who said, “The world is crucified unto me, and I unto
the world:”5445 this death they had died unto whom he said, “Ye are dead, and your life is
hid with Christ in God.”5446 Love is strong as death…

Psalm CXXII
13. Thus as he was here speaking of charity, he addeth, “For my brethren and compan-
ions’ sake, I spoke peace of thee” (ver. 8). O Jerusalem, thou city whose partaking is in The
Same, I in this life and on this earth, I poor, he saith, I a stranger and groaning, not as yet
enjoying to the full thy peace, and preaching thy peace; preach it not for my own sake, as
the heretics, who seeking their own glory, say, Peace be with you: and have not the peace
which they preach to the people. For if they had peace, they would not tear asunder unity.
“I,” he saith, “spoke peace of thee.” But wherefore? “For my brethren and companions’
sake:” not for my own honour, not for my own money, not for my life; for, “To me to live
is Christ, and to die is gain.” But, “I spoke peace of thee, for my brethren and companions’
sakes.” For he wished to depart, and to be with Christ: but, since he must preach these things
to his companions and his brethren, to abide in the flesh, he addeth, is more needful for
you.5447
14. “Because of the house of the Lord my God, I have sought good things for thee” (ver.
9). Not on my own account have sought good things, for then I should not seek for thee,
but for myself; and so should I not have them, because I should not seek them for thee; but,
“Because of the house of the Lord my God,” because of the Church, because of the Saints,
because of the pilgrims; because of the poor, that they may go up; because we say to them,
we will go into the house of the Lord: because of the house of the Lord my God itself, I have
sought good things for Thee. These long and needful words gather ye, brethren, eat them,
drink them, and grow strong, run, and seize.

Psalm CXXII
Psalm CXXIII.5448
1. …Let this singer ascend; and let this man sing from the heart of each of you, and let
each of you be this man, for when each of you saith this, since ye are all one in Christ, one
man saith this; and saith not, “Unto Thee, O Lord, have” we “lift up” our “eyes;” but, “Unto
Thee, O Lord, have I lift up mine eyes” (ver. 1). Ye ought indeed to imagine that every one
of you is speaking; but that One in an especial sense speaketh, who is also spread abroad
over the whole world…
What maketh the heart of a Christian heavy? Because he is a pilgrim, and longeth for
his country. If thy heart be heavy on this score, although thou hast been prosperous in the
world, still thou dost groan: and if all things combine to render thee prosperous, and this
world smile upon thee on every side, thou nevertheless groanest, because thou seest that
thou art set in a pilgrimage; and feelest that thou hast indeed happiness in the eyes of fools,
but not as yet after the promise of Christ: this thou seekest with groans, this thou seekest
with longings, and by longing ascendest, and while thou ascendest dost sing the Song of
Degrees.
2. …Where then are the ladders? For we behold so great an interval between heaven
and earth, there is so wide a separation, and so great a space of regions between: we wish to
climb thither, we see no ladder; do we deceive ourselves, because we sing the Song of Degrees,
that is, the Song of ascent? We ascend unto heaven, if we think of God, who hath made as-
cending steps in the heart. What is to ascend in heart? To advance towards God. As every
man who faileth, doth not descend, but falleth: so every one who profiteth doth ascend: but
if he so profit, as to avoid pride: if he so ascend as not to fall: but if while he profiteth he
become proud, in ascending he again falleth. But that he may not be proud, what ought he
to do? Let him lift up his eyes unto Him who dwelleth in heaven, let him not heed himself…
3. If, my brethren, we understand by heaven the firmament which we see with our
bodily eyes, we shall indeed so err, as to imagine that we cannot ascend thither without
ladders, or some scaling machines: but if we ascend spiritually, we ought to understand
heaven spiritually: if the ascent be in affection, heaven is in righteousness. What is then the
heaven of God? All holy souls, all righteous souls. For the Apostles also, although they were
on earth in the flesh, were heaven; for the Lord, enthroned in them, traversed the whole
world. He then dwelleth in heaven. How?…How long are they the temple according to faith?
As long as Christ dwelleth in them through faith; as the Apostle saith, “That Christ may
dwell in your hearts through faith.” But they are already heaven in whom God already
dwelleth visibly, who see Him face to face; all the holy Apostles, all the holy Virtues, Powers,
Thrones, Lordships, that heavenly Jerusalem, wanderers from whence we groan, and for
5448 Lat. CXXII. [On “Degrees,” see p. 593, supra.—C.]
Psalm CXXIII
Psalm CXXIII
which we pray with longing; and there God dwelleth. Thither hath the Psalmist lifted up
his faith, thither he riseth in affection, with longing hopes: and this very longing causeth
the soul to purge off5449 the filth of sins, and to be cleansed from every stain, that itself also
may become heaven; because it hath lifted up its eyes unto Him who dwelleth in heaven.
For if we have determined that that heaven which we see with our bodily eyes is the dwelling
of God, the dwelling of God will pass away; for “heaven and earth will pass away.”5450 Then,
before God created heaven and earth, where did He dwell? But some one saith: and before
God made the Saints, where did He dwell? God dwelt in Himself, he dwelt with Himself,
and God is with Himself. And when He deigneth to dwell in the Saints, the Saints are not
the house of God in such wise, as that God should fall when it is withdrawn. For we dwell
in a house in one way, in another way God dwelleth in the Saints. Thou dwellest in a house:
if it be withdrawn, thou fallest: but God so dwelleth in the Saints, that if He should Himself
depart, they fall…
4. What then followeth, since he hath said, “Unto Thee do I lift up mine eyes”? (ver. 2).
How hast thou lifted up thine eyes? “Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand
of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes
wait upon the Lord our God, until He have mercy upon us.” We are both servants, and a
handmaiden: He is both our Master and our Mistress. What do these words mean? What
do these similitudes mean? It is not wonderful if we are servants, and He our Master; but it
is wonderful if we are a maiden, and He our Mistress. But not even our being a maiden is
wonderful; for we are the Church: nor is it wonderful that He is our Mistress; for He is the
Power and the Wisdom of God…When therefore thou hearest Christ, lift up thine eyes to
the hands of thy Master; when thou hearest the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, lift
up thine eyes to the hands of thy Mistress; for thou art both servant and handmaiden; servant,
for thou art a people;5451 handmaiden,5452 for thou art the Church. But this maiden hath
found great dignity with God; she hath been made a wife. But until she come unto those
spiritual embraces, where she may without apprehension enjoy Him whom she hath loved,
and for whom she hath sighed in this tedious pilgrimage, she is betrothed: and hath received
a mighty pledge, the blood of the Spouse for whom she sigheth without fear. Nor is it said
unto her, Do not love; as it is sometimes said to any betrothed virgin, not as yet married:
and is justly said, Do not love; when thou hast become a wife, then love: it is rightly said,
because it is a precipitate and preposterous thing, and not a chaste desire, to love one whom
she knoweth not whether she shall marry. For it may happen that one man may be betrothed
5449 Desudare.
5450 Matt. xxiv. 35.
5451 Populus (masc.).
5452 Ecclesia (fem.).
Psalm CXXIII
to her, and another man marry her. But as there is no one else who can be preferred to
Christ, let her love without apprehension: and before she is joined unto Him, let her love,
and sigh from a distance and from her far pilgrimage…
5. “For we have been much filled with contempt” (ver. 3). All that will live piously ac-
cording to Christ, must needs suffer reproof,5453 must needs be despised by those who do
not choose to live piously, all whose happiness is earthly. They are derided who call that
happiness which they cannot see with their eyes, and it is said to them, What believest thou,
madman? Dost thou see what thou believest? Hath any one returned from the world below,
and reported to thee what is going on there? Behold I see and enjoy what I love. Thou art
scorned, because thou dost hope for what thou seest not; and he who seemeth to hold what
he seeth, scorneth thee. Consider well if he doth really hold it…I have my house, he hath
boasted himself. Thou askest, what house of his own? That which my father left me. And
whence did he derive this house? My grandfather left it him. Go back even to his great
grandfather, then to his great grandfather’s father, and he can no longer tell their names.
Art thou not rather terrified by this thought, that thou seest many have passed through this
house, and that none of them hath carried it away with him to his everlasting home? Thy
father left it: he passed through it: thus thou also wilt pass by. If therefore thou hast a mere
passing stay in thy house, it is an inn for passing guests, not an habitation for permanent
abode. Yet since we hope for those things which are to come, and sigh for future happiness,
and since it hath not yet appeared what we shall be, although we are already “sons of
God;”5454 for “our life is hidden with Christ in God:”5455 “we are utterly despised,” by those
who seek or enjoy happiness in this world.
6. “Our soul is filled exceedingly; a reproach to the wealthy, and a contempt to the
proud” (ver. 4). We were asking who were “the wealthy:” he hath expounded to thee, in that
he hath said, “the proud.” “Reproach” and “contempt” are the same: and “wealthy” is the
same with “proud.” It is a repetition of the sentence, “a reproach to the wealthy, and a con-
tempt to the proud.” Why are the proud wealthy? Because they wish to be happy here. Why?
since they themselves too are miserable, are they wealthy? But perhaps when they are
miserable, they do not mock us. Listen, my beloved. Then perchance they mock when they
are happy, when they boast themselves in the pomp of their riches! when they boast them-
selves in the inflated state of false honours: then they mock us, and seem to say, Behold, it
is well with me: I enjoy the good things before me: let those who promise what they cannot
show depart from me: what I see, I hold; what I see, I enjoy; may I fare well in this life. Be
thou more secure; for Christ hath risen again, and hath taught thee what He will give in
5453 2 Tim. iii. 12.
5454 1 John iii. 2.
5455 Col. iii. 3.
Psalm CXXIII
another life: be assured that He giveth it. But that man mocketh thee, because he holdeth
what he hath. Bear with his mockeries, and thou wilt laugh at his groans: for afterwards
there will come a season when these very persons will say, “This was he whom we had
sometimes in derision.” 5456…
7. To this we must add, that sometimes those also who are beneath the scourge of tem-
poral unhappiness, mock us…Did not the robber5457 mock, who was crucified with our
crucified Lord? If therefore they who are not wealthy mock us, why doth the Psalm say, “A
reproach to the wealthy”? If we carefully sift the matter, even these (the unfortunate) are
wealthy. How are they wealthy? Yea; for if they were not wealthy, they would not be proud.
For one man is wealthy in money, and proud on that score: another is wealthy in honours,
and is proud on that account: another imagines himself wealthy in righteousness, and hence
his pride, which is worse. They who seem not to be wealthy in money, seem to themselves
to be wealthy in righteousness towards God; and when calamity overtakes them, they justify
themselves, accuse God, and say, What wrong have I been guilty of, or, what have I done?
Thou repliest: Look back, call to mind thy sins, see if thou hast done nothing. He is somewhat
touched in conscience, and returneth to himself, and thinketh of his evil deeds; and when
he hath thought of his evil deeds, not even then doth he choose to confess that he deserves
his sufferings; but saith, Behold, I have clearly done many things; but I see that many have
done worse, and suffer no evil. He is righteous against God. He also therefore is wealthy:
he hath his breast puffed out with righteousness; since God seemeth to him to do ill, and
he seemeth to himself to suffer unjustly. And if thou gavest him a vessel to pilot, he would
be shipwrecked with it: yet he wishes to deprive God of the government of this world, and
himself to hold the helm of Creation, and to distribute among all men pains and pleasures,
punishments and rewards. Miserable soul! yet why do ye wonder? He is wealthy, but wealthy
in iniquity, wealthy in malignity; but is more wealthy in iniquity, in proportion as he seemeth
to himself to be wealthy in righteousness.
8. But a Christian ought not to be wealthy, but ought to acknowledge himself poor; and
if he hath riches, he ought to know that they are not true riches, so that he may desire oth-
ers…And what is the wealth of our righteousness? How much soever righteousness there
may be in us, it is a sort of dew compared to that fountain:5458 compared to that
plenteousness it is as a few drops, which may soften our life, and relax our hard iniquity.
Let us only desire to be filled with the full fountain of righteousness, let us long to be filled
with that abundant richness, of which it is said in the Psalm, “They shall be satisfied with
5456 Wisd. v. 3.

and purgatorial pains?—C.]
Psalm CXXIII
the plenteousness of Thy house: and Thou shalt give them drink out of the torrent of Thy
pleasure.”5459 But while we are here, let us understand ourselves to be destitute and in want;
not only in respect of those riches which are not the true riches, but of salvation itself. And
when we are whole, let us understand that we are weak. For as long as this body hungers
and thirsts, as long as this body is weary with watching, weary with standing, weary with
walking, weary with sitting, weary with eating; whithersoever it turneth itself for a relief
from weariness, there it discovereth another source of fatigue: there is therefore no perfect
soundness, not even in the body itself. Those riches are then not riches, but beggary; for the
more they abound, the more doth destitution and avarice increase…Let then our whole
hunger, our whole thirst, be for true riches, and true health, and true righteousness. What
are true riches? That heavenly abode in Jerusalem. For who is called rich on this earth?
When a rich man is praised, what is meant? He is very rich: nothing is wanting to him. That
surely is the praise of him that praiseth the other: for it is not this, when it is said, He wants
nothing. Consider if he really want nothing. If he desires nothing, he wants nothing: but if
he still desires more than what he hath, his riches have increased in such wise, that his wants
have increased also. But in that City there will be true riches, because there will be nothing
wanting to us there; for we shall not be in need of anything, and there will be true health…
5459 Ps. xxxvi. 8.
Psalm CXXIII
Psalm CXXIV.5460
1. Ye already well know, dearest brethren, that a “Song of Degrees,” is a song of our as-
cent: and that this ascent is not effected by the feet of the body, but by the affections of the
heart. This we have repeatedly reminded you of: and we need not repeat it too often, that
there may be room for saying what hath not yet been said. This Psalm, therefore, which ye
have now heard sung for you,5461 is inscribed, “A Song of Degrees.” This is its title. They
sing therefore while ascending: and sometimes as it were one man singeth, sometimes as it
were many; because many are one, since Christ is One, and in Christ the members of Christ
constitute one with Christ, and the Head of all these members is in heaven. But although
the body toileth on earth, it is not cut off from its Head; for the Head looketh down from
above, and regardeth the body. 5462…Whether therefore one or many sing; many men are
one man, because it is unity; and Christ, as we have said, is One, and all Christians are
members of Christ.
2. …Certain members indeed of that body of which we also are, which can sing in truth,
have gone before us. And this the holy Martyrs have sung: for they have already escaped,
and are with Christ in joy about to receive at last incorruptible bodies, the very same which
were at first corruptible, wherein they have suffered pains; of the same there will be made
for them ornaments of righteousness. Therefore whether they in reality, or we in hope,
joining our affections with their crowns, and longing for such a life as we have not here,
and shall never gain unless we have longed for it here, let us all sing together, and say, “If
the Lord Himself had not been in us.”…
3. “If the Lord Himself had not been in us, now may Israel say” (ver. 1)…When? “When
men rose up against us” (ver. 2). Marvel not: they have been subdued: for they were men;
but the Lord was in us, man was not in us: for men rose up against us. Nevertheless men
would crush other men, unless in those men who could not be crushed, there were not man,
but the Lord. For what could men do to you, while ye rejoiced, and sang, and securely held
everlasting bliss? what could men do to you when they rose against you, if the Lord had not
been on your side? what could they do? “Perchance they had swallowed us up quick” (ver.
3). “Swallowed us up:”5463 they would not first have slain us, and so have swallowed us up.
O inhuman, O cruel men! The Church swalloweth not thus.5464 To Peter it was said, “Kill
and eat:”5465 not, Swallow quick. Because no man entereth into the body of the Church,

save he be slain first.5466 What he was dieth, that he may be what he was not. Otherwise, he
who is not slain, and is not eaten by the Church, may be in the visible number of the people:
but he cannot be in the number of the people which is known to God, whereof the Apostle
saith, “The Lord knoweth who are His,”5467 save he be eaten; and eaten he cannot be, save
he first be slain. The Pagan cometh, still in him idolatry liveth; he must be grafted among
the members of Christ: that he may be engrafted, he must needs be eaten; but he cannot be
eaten by the Church, save first he be slain. Let him renounce the world, then is he slain; let
him believe in God, then is he eaten…But they in whom the Lord is, are slain and die not.
But they who consent5468 and live, are swallowed quick, when swallowed up they die. But
they who have suffered, and have not yielded to tribulations, rejoice and say, “If the Lord
had not been in us,” etc.
4. …“When their fury was enraged upon us.” They are now in anger, they now openly
rage: “perchance the water had drowned us” (ver. 4). By water he meaneth ungodly nations:
and we shall see what sort of water in the following verses. Whoever had consented unto
them, water would have overwhelmed him. For he would die by the death of the Egyptians,
he would not pass through after the example of the Israelites. For ye know, brethren, that
the people of Israel passed through the water, by which the Egyptians were overwhelmed.5469
But what sort of water is this? It is a torrent, it flows with violence, but it will pass by…Hence
He, our Head, first drinketh, of whom it is said in the Psalms, “He shall drink of the torrent
in the way: therefore shall He lift up His head.” For our Head is already exalted, because He
drank of the torrent by the way; for our Lord hath suffered. If therefore our Head hath been
already raised up, why doth the body fear the torrent? Without doubt, because the Head
hath been raised, the body also will say hereafter, “Our soul hath passed over the torrent.
Perhaps our soul hath passed over the water without substance” (ver. 5). Behold, what sort
of water he was speaking of, “The water perchance had overwhelmed us.” But what meaneth,
“without substance”?
5. In the first place, what meaneth,5470 “Perchance our soul hath passed over”? (ver. 5).
Understand however the meaning to be this: “Thinkest thou our soul hath passed over?”
and why do they say, “Thinkest thou”? Because the greatness of the danger maketh it hardly

credible that he hath escaped. They have endured a great death: they have been in great
dangers; they have been so much oppressed, that they almost gave consent while alive, and
were all but swallowed up alive: now therefore that they have escaped, now that they are
secure, but still remember the danger, the great danger, say, “Thinkest thou our soul hath
passed over the water without substance?”
6. What is the water without substance, save the water of sins without substance? For
sins have not substance: they have destitution, not substance; they have want, not substance.
In that water without substance, the younger son lost the whole of his substance…Dost thou
wish to see how the water is without substance? Take away with thee to the world below
what thou hast acquired: what wilt thou do? Thou hast acquired gold: thou hast lost thy
faith: after a few days thou leavest this life; thou canst not take away with thee the gold thou
hast acquired by the loss of thy good faith; thy heart, destitute of faith, goeth forth into
punishment—thy heart, which if full of faith, would go forth unto a crown. Behold, what
thou hast done is nothing: and thou hast offended God for nothing.
7. Men hear that common proverb; and the proverbs of God slumber in them. What
proverb? “Better in hand than in hope.”5471 Unhappy man, what hast thou in hand? Thou
sayest, “Better in hand.” Hold it so as not to lose it, and then say, “Better in hand.” But if
thou holdest it not, why dost thou not hold fast that which thou canst not lose? What then
hast thou in hand? Gold. Keep it in hand, therefore: if thou hast it in hand, let it not be taken
away without thy consent. But if through gold also thou art carried where thou wishest not,
and if a more powerful robber seeketh thee, because he findeth thee a less powerful robber;
if a stronger eagle pursue thee, because thou hast carried off a hare before him: the lesser
was thy prey, thou wilt be a prey unto the greater. Men see not these things in human affairs:
by so much avarice are they blinded…
8. Let them escape the water without substance, and say, “Blessed be the Lord, who hath
not given us over for a prey unto their teeth” (ver. 6). For the hunters were following, and
had placed a bait in their trap. What bait? The sweetness of this life, so that each man for
the sake of the sweetness of this life may thrust his head into iniquity, and be caught in the
trap. Not they, in whom the Lord was, they who say, “If the Lord Himself had not been in

or usually do express by Putas: as in this instance, Dost thou think (putas) I have escaped this? If we say, Perchance
I have escaped, ye see that it hath not this meaning: but the word, Thinkest thou, is commonly used: but not in
Latin in this sense. Although I may use it, when expounding to you; for I often use words that are not Latin, that
ye may understand. But in Scripture this could not be used, because it was not Latin; and as Latin failed, that
was used for it which had not this meaning.”—C.]

us;” they have not been taken in the trap. Let the Lord be in thee, and thou wilt not be taken
in the trap.
9. “Our soul is escaped, even as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers” (ver. 7). Because
the Lord was in the soul itself, therefore hath that soul escaped, even as a bird out of the
snare of the fowler. Why like a bird? Because it had fallen heedlessly, like a bird; and it could
say afterwards, God will forgive me. Unstable bird, rather set thy feet firm upon the rock:
go not into the trap. Thou wilt be taken, consumed, crushed. Let the Lord be in thee, and
He will deliver thee from greater threats, from the snare of the fowlers. As if thou wert to
see a bird about to fall into a snare, thou makest a greater noise that it may fly away from
the net; so also, when perhaps some even of the Martyrs were stretching out their neck after
the enjoyment of this life, the Lord, who was in them, made the noise of hell, and the bird
was delivered from the snare of the fowlers. The snare was the sweetness of this life: they
were not entangled in the snare, and were slain; by their slaughter the net was broken; no
longer did the sweetness of this life remain, that they might again be entangled by it, but it
was crushed. Was the bird also crushed? Far be it! for it was not in the snare: “The snare is
broken, and we are delivered.”
10. …“Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord, who hath made heaven and earth”
(ver. 8). For if this were not our help, the snare would not indeed remain for ever; but when
the bird was once taken, it would be crushed. For this life will pass away; and they who shall
have been taken in by its pleasures, and through these pleasures have offended God, will
pass away with this life. For the snare will be broken; be ye assured of this: all the sweetness
of this present life will no longer exist, when the lot assigned to it hath been fulfilled; but we
must not be enthralled by it, so that when the net is broken, thou mayest then rejoice and
say, “The snare is broken, and we are delivered.” But lest thou think that thou canst do this
of thy own strength, consider whose work thy deliverance is (for if thou art proud, thou
fallest into the snare), and say, “Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord, who hath made
heaven and earth.”…
Psalm CXXIV
Psalm CXXV.5472
1. This Psalm, belonging to the number of the Songs of Degrees, teacheth us, while we
ascend and raise our minds unto the Lord our God in loving charity and piety, not to fix
our gaze upon men who are prosperous in this world, with a happiness that is false and
unstable, and altogether seductive; where they cherish nothing save pride, and their heart
freezeth up against God, and is made hard against the shower of His grace, so that it beareth
not fruit.…
2. “They that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: they shall not
be removed for ever” (ver. 1).
3. Who are these? “They shall stand fast for ever, who dwell in Jerusalem” (ver. 2). If we
understand this earthly Jerusalem, all who dwelt therein have been excluded by wars and
by the destruction of the city: thou now seekest a Jew in the city of Jerusalem, and findest
him not. Why then will “they that dwell in Jerusalem not be moved for ever,” save because
there is another Jerusalem, of which ye are wont to hear much? She is our mother, for whom
we sigh and groan in this pilgrimage, that we may return unto her.…They then who dwell
therein “shall never be moved.” But they who dwelt in that earthly Jerusalem, have been
moved; first in heart, afterwards by exile. When they were moved in heart and fell, then they
crucified the King of the heavenly Jerusalem herself; they were already spiritually without,
and shut out of doors their very King. For they cast Him out without their city, and crucified
Him without.5473 He too cast them out of His city, that is, of the everlasting Jerusalem, the
Mother of us all, who is in Heaven.
4. What is this Jerusalem? He briefly describes it. “The mountains stand around Jerus-
alem” (ver. 2). Is it anything great, that we are in a city surrounded by mountains? Is this
the whole of our happiness, that we shall have a city which mountains surround? Do we not
know what mountains are? or what are mountains save swellings of the earth? Different
then from these are those mountains that we love, lofty mountains, preachers of truth,
whether Angels, or Apostles, or Prophets. They stand around Jerusalem; they surround her,
and, as it were, form a wall for her. Of these lovely and delightful mountains Scripture
constantly speaketh.…They are the mountains of whom we sing: “I lifted up mine eyes unto
the mountains, from whence my help shall come:”5474 because in this life we have help from
the holy Scriptures.5475 And through the mountains that receive peace, the little hills received
righteousness: for what saith he of the mountains themselves? He said not, they have peace

from themselves, or they make peace, or generate peace; but, they receive peace. The Lord
is the source, whence they receive peace. So therefore lift up thine eyes to the mountains for
the sake of peace, that thy help may come from the Lord, who hath made heaven and earth.
Again, the Holy Spirit mentioning these mountains saith this: “Thou dost light them won-
derfully from Thy everlasting mountains.”5476 He said not, the mountains light them: but,
Thou lightest them from Thy everlasting mountains: through those mountains whom Thou
hast willed to be everlasting, preaching the Gospel, Thou lighting them, not the mountains.
Such then are the “mountains that stand around Jerusalem.”
5. And that ye may know what sort of mountains these be that stand around Jerusalem;
where Scripture hath mentioned good mountains, very rarely, and hardly, and perhaps
never, doth it fail instantly to mention the Lord also, or allude to Him at the same moment,
that our hopes rest not in the mountains.…Lest thou again shouldest tarry in the mountains,
he at once addeth, “Even so the Lord standeth round about His people:” that thy hope might
not lie in the mountains, but in Him who lighteth the mountains.5477 For when He dwelleth
in the mountains, that is, in the Saints, He Himself is round about His people; and He hath
Himself walled His people with a spiritual fortification, that it may not be moved for ever-
more. But when Scripture speaketh of evil mountains, it addeth not the Lord unto them.
Such mountains, we have already told you often, signify certain mighty, but evil, souls. For
ye are not to suppose, brethren, that heresies could be produced through any little souls.
None save great men have been the authors of heresies; but in proportion as they were
mighty, so were they evil, mountains. For they were not such mountains as would receive
peace, that the hills might receive righteousness; but they received dissension from their
father the devil. There were therefore mountains: beware thou fly not to such mountains.
For men will come, and say unto thee, There is a great hero, there is a great man! How great
was that Donatus! How great is Maximian! and a certain Photinus, what a great man he
was! And Arius too, how illustrious he was! All these I have mentioned are mountains, but
mountains that cause shipwreck.5478…
6. But love such mountains, in whom the Lord is. Then do those very mountains love
thee, if thou hast not placed hope in them.5479 See, brethren, what the mountains of God
are. Thence they are so called in another passage: “Thy righteousness is like the mountains
5476 Ps. lxxvi. 4.
5477 [Evidence against saint-worship.—C.]
5478 [So Jude 16.—C.] Vinc. Lir. Common. §§ 17–20.
5479 [Evidence against saint-worship.—C.]
Psalm CXXV
of God.”5480 Not their righteousness, but “Thy righteousness.” Hear that great mountain
the Apostle. “That I may be found in Him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of
the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ.”5481 But they who have chosen to be
mountains through their own righteousness, as certain Jews or Pharisees their rulers, are
thus blamed: “Being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their
own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.”5482
But they who have submitted themselves are exalted in such a manner as to be humble. In
that they are great, they are mountains; in that they submit themselves unto God, they are
valleys: and in that they have the capacity of piety, they receive the plenteousness of peace,
and transmit the copious irrigation to the hills, only beware, at present, what mountains
thou lovest. If thou wish to be loved by good mountains, place not thy trust even in good
mountains. For how great a mountain was Paul? where is one like him found? We speak of
the greatness of men. Can any one readily be found of so great grace? Nevertheless, he feared
lest that bird should place trust in him: and what doth he say: “Was Paul crucified for
you?”5483 But lift up your eyes unto the mountains, whence help may come unto you: for,
“I have planted, Apollos hath watered:” but, your help cometh from the Lord, who hath
made Heaven and earth; for, “God gave the increase.”5484 “The mountains,” therefore,
“stand around Jerusalem.” But as “the mountains stand around Jerusalem, even so standeth
the Lord round about His people, from this time forth for evermore.” If therefore the
mountains stand around Jerusalem, and the Lord standeth round about His people, the
Lord bindeth His people into one bond of love and peace, so that they who trust in the Lord,
like the mount Sion, may not be moved for evermore: and this is, “from this time forth for
evermore.”
7. “For the Lord will not leave the rod of the ungodly upon the lot of the righteous, lest
the righteous put forth their hands unto wickedness” (ver. 3). At present indeed the righteous
suffer in some measure, and at present the unrighteous sometimes tyrannize over the
righteous. In what ways? Sometimes the unrighteous arrive at worldly honours: when they
have arrived at them, and have been made either judges or kings; for God doth this for the
discipline of His folk, for the discipline of His people; the honour due to their power must
needs be shown them. For thus hath God ordained His Church, that every power ordained
in the world may have honour, and sometimes from those who are better than those in
power. For the sake of illustration I take one instance; hence calculate the grades of all

powers. The primary and every day relation of authority between man and man is that
between master and slave. Almost all houses have a power of this sort. There are masters,
there are also slaves; these are different names, but men and men are equal names.5485 And
what saith the Apostle, teaching that slaves are subject to their masters? “Servants, be
obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh:” for there is a Master according
to the Spirit. He is the true and everlasting Master; but those temporal masters are for a time
only. When thou walkest in the way, when thou livest in this life, Christ doth not wish to
make thee proud. It hath been thy lot to become a Christian, and to have a man for thy
master: thou wast not made a Christian, that thou mightest disdain to be a servant. For
when by Christ’s command thou servest a man, thou servest not the man, but Him who
commanded thee. He saith this also: “Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters
according to the flesh.”5486 Behold, he hath not made men free from being servants, but
good servants from bad servants. How much do the rich owe to Christ, who orders their
house for them! so that if thou hast had an unbelieving servant, suppose Christ convert him,
and say not to him, Leave thy master, thou hast now known Him who is thy true Master:
he perhaps is ungodly and unjust, thou art now faithful and righteous: it is unworthy that
a righteous and faithful man should serve an unjust and unbelieving master. He spoke not
thus unto him, but rather, Serve him: and to confirm the servant, added, Serve as I served;
I before thee served the unjust.…If the Lord of heaven and earth, through whom all things
were created, served the unworthy, asked mercy for His furious persecutors, and, as it were,
showed Himself as their Physician at His Advent (for physicians also, better both in art and
health, serve the sick): how much more ought not a man to disdain, with his whole mind,
and his whole good will, with his whole love to serve even a bad master! Behold, a better
serveth an inferior, but for a season. Understand what I have said of the master and slave,
to be true also of powers and kings, of all the exalted stations of this world. For sometimes
they are good powers, and fear God; sometimes they fear not God. Julian was an infidel
Emperor, an apostate, a wicked man, an idolater; Christian soldiers served an infidel Emperor;
when they came to the cause of Christ, they acknowledged Him only who was in heaven. If
he called upon them at any time to worship idols, to offer incense; they preferred God to
him: but whenever he commanded them to deploy into line, to march against this or that
nation, they at once obeyed. They distinguished their everlasting from their temporal master;
and yet they were, for the sake of their everlasting Master, submissive to their temporal
master.
5485 [The Epistle to Philemon is here reflected. See A.N.F. vol. viii. p. 782, note 1, and p. 784; also vol. vii. p.
5486 Eph. vi. 5.
Psalm CXXV
8. But will it be thus always, that the ungodly have power over the righteous? It will not
be so. The rod of the ungodly is felt for a season upon the lot of the righteous; but it is not
left there, it will not be there for ever. A time will come, when Christ, appearing in his glory,
shall gather all nations before Him.5487 And thou wilt see there many slaves among the
sheep, and many masters among the goats; and again many masters among the sheep, many
slaves among the goats. For all slaves are not good—do not infer this from the consolation
we have given to servants—nor are all masters evil, because we have thus repressed the pride
of masters. There are good masters who believe, and there are evil: there are good servants
who believe, and there are evil. But as long as good servants serve evil masters, let them en-
dure for a season. “For God will not leave the rod of the ungodly upon the lot of the right-
eous.” Why will He not? “Lest the righteous put forth their hand unto wickedness:” that the
righteous may endure for a season the domination of the ungodly, and may understand that
this is not for ever, but may prepare themselves to possess their everlasting heritage.…
9. And he therefore addeth, “Do well, O Lord, unto those that are good and true of
heart” (ver. 4). They who are right in heart, of whom I was speaking a little before,—they
who follow the will of God, not their own will,—reflect upon this. But they who wish to
follow God, allow Him to go before, and themselves to follow; not themselves to go before,
and Him to follow; and in all things they find Him good, whether chastening, or consoling,
or exercising, or crowning, or cleansing, or enlightening; as the Apostle saith, “We know
that all things work together for good to them that love God.”5488
10. Whence the Psalmist at once addeth: “As for such as turn aside, the Lord shall lead
them forth unto strangling with the workers of unrighteousness” (ver. 5): that is, those whose
deeds they have imitated; because they took delight in their present pleasures, and did not
believe in their punishments to come. What then shall they have, who are righteous in heart,
and who turn not back? Let us now come to the heritage itself, brethren, for we are sons.
What shall we possess? What is our heritage? what is our country: what is it called? Peace.
In this we salute you, this we announce to you, this the mountains receive, and the little hills
receive as righteousness.5489 Peace is Christ: “for He is our peace, who hath made both one,
and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us.”5490 Since we are sons, we
shall have an inheritance. And what shall this inheritance be called, but peace? And consider
that they who love not peace are disinherited. Now they who divide unity, love not peace.
Peace is the possession of the pious, the possession of heirs. And who are heirs? Sons.…Since
then Christ the Son of God is peace, He therefore came to gather together His own, and to

separate them from the wicked. From what wicked men? From those who hate Jerusalem,
who hate peace, who wish to tear unity asunder, who believe not peace, who preach a false
peace to the people, and have it not. To whom answer is made, when they say,5491 “Peace
be with you,” “And with thy spirit:” but they speak falsely, and they hear falsely. Unto whom
do they say, Peace be with you? To those whom they separate from the peace of the whole
earth. And unto whom is it said, “And with thy spirit”? To those who embrace dissensions,
and who hate peace. For if peace were in their spirit, would they not love unity, and leave
dissensions? Speaking then false words, they hear false words. Let us speak true words, and
hear true words. Let us be Israel, and let us embrace peace; for Jerusalem is a vision of peace,
and we are Israel, “and peace is upon Israel.”

Psalm CXXV
Psalm CXXVI.5492
1. …How man had come into captivity, let us ask the Apostle Paul.…For he saith: “For
we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.”5493 Behold whence we
became captives; because we were sold under sin. Who sold us? We ourselves, who consented
to the seducer. We could sell ourselves; we could not redeem ourselves. We sold ourselves
by consent of sin, we are redeemed in the faith of righteousness. For innocent blood was
given for us, that we might be redeemed. Whatsoever blood he shed in persecuting the
righteous, what kind of blood did he shed? Righteous men’s blood, indeed, he shed; they
were Prophets, righteous men, our fathers, and Martyrs. Whose blood he shed, yet all
coming of the offspring of sin. One blood he shed of Him who was not justified,5494 but
born righteous: by shedding that blood, he lost those whom he held. For they for whom
innocent blood was given were redeemed, and, turned back from their captivity, they sing
this Psalm.
2. “When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became as those that are com-
forted” (ver. 1). He meant by this to say, we became joyful. When? “When the Lord turned
back the captivity of Sion.” What is Sion? Jerusalem, the same is also the eternal Sion. How
is Sion eternal, how is Sion captive? In angels eternal, in men captive. For not all the citizens
of that city are captives, but those who are away from thence, they are captives. Man was a
citizen of Jerusalem, but sold under sin he became a pilgrim. Of his progeny was born the
human race, and the captivity of Sion filled all lands. And how is this captivity of Sion a
shadow of that Jerusalem? The shadow of that Sion, which was granted to the Jews, in an
image, in a figure, was in captivity in Babylonia, and after seventy years that people turned
back to its own city.5495…But when all time is past, then we return to our country, as after
seventy years that people returned from the Babylonish captivity, for Babylon is this world;
since Babylon is interpreted “confusion.”…So then this whole life of human affairs is con-
fusion, which belongeth not unto God. In this confusion, in this Babylonish land, Sion is
held captive. But “the Lord hath turned back the captivity of Sion.” “And we became,” he
saith, “as those that are comforted.” That is, we rejoiced as receiving consolation. Consolation
is not save for the unhappy, consolation is not save for them that groan, that mourn.
Wherefore, “as those that are comforted,” except because we are still mourning? We mourn
for our present lot, we are comforted in hope: when the present is passed by, of our
mourning will come everlasting joy, when there will be no need of consolation, because we
shall be wounded with no distress. But wherefore saith he “as” those that are comforted,

and saith not comforted? This word “as,” is not always put for likeness: when we say “As,”
it sometimes refers to the actual case, sometimes to likeness: here it is with reference to the
actual case.…Walk therefore in Christ, and sing rejoicing, sing as one that is comforted;
because He went before thee who hath commanded thee to follow Him.
3. “Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation” (ver. 2). That
mouth, brethren, which we have in our body, how is it “filled with joy”? It useth not to be
“filled,” save with meat, or drink, or some such thing put into the mouth. Sometimes our
mouth is filled; and it is more that we say to your holiness,5496 when we have our mouth
full, we cannot speak. But we have a mouth within, that is, in the heart, whence whatsoever
proceedeth, if it is evil, defileth us, if it is good, cleanseth us. For concerning this very mouth
ye heard when the Gospel was read. For the Jews reproached the Lord, because His disciples
ate with unwashen hands.5497 They reproached who had cleanness without; and within
were full of stains. They reproached, whose righteousness was only in the eyes of men. But
the Lord sought our inward cleanness, which if we have, the outside must needs be clean
also. “Cleanse,” He saith, “the inside,” and “the outside shall be clean also.”5498…
4. But let us return to what was just now read from the Gospel, relating to the verse before
us, “Our mouth was filled with joy, and our tongue with delight:” for we are inquiring what
mouth and what tongue. Listen, beloved brethren. The Lord was scoffed at, because His
disciples ate with unwashed hands. The Lord answered them as was fitting, and said unto
the crowds whom He had called unto Him, “Hear ye all, and understand: not that which
goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth
a man.”5499 What is this? when He said, what goeth into the mouth, He meant only the
mouth of the body. For meat goeth in, and meats defile not a man; because, “All things are
clean to the clean;” and, “every creature of God is good, and none to be refused, if it be re-
ceived with thanksgiving.”5500…
5. Guard the mouth of thy heart from evil, and thou wilt be innocent: the tongue of thy
body will be innocent, thy hands will be innocent; even thy feet will be innocent, thy eyes,
thy ears, will be innocent; all thy members will serve under righteousness, because a righteous
commander hath thy heart. “Then shall they say among the heathen, the Lord hath done
great things for them.”
6. “Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already, whereof we rejoice” (ver. 3).
Consider, my brethren, if Sion doth not at present say this among the heathen, throughout

the whole world; consider if men are not running unto the Church. In the whole world our
redemption is received; Amen is answered. The dwellers in Jerusalem, therefore, captive,
destined to return, pilgrims, sighing for their country, speak thus among the heathen. What
do they say? “The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we rejoice.” Have they done
anything for themselves? They have done ill with themselves, for they have sold themselves
under sin. The Redeemer came, and did the good things for them.
7. “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the torrents in the south” (ver. 4). Consider, my
brethren, what this meaneth.…As torrents are turned in the south, so turn our captivity. In
a certain passage Scripture saith, in admonishing us concerning good works, “Thy sins also
shall melt away, even as the ice in fair warm weather.”5501 Our sins therefore bound us.
How? As the cold bindeth the water that it run not. Bound with the frost of our sins, we
have frozen. But the south wind is a warm wind: when the south wind blows, the ice melts,
and the torrents are filled. Now winter streams are called torrents; for filled with sudden
rains they run with great force. We had therefore become frozen in captivity; our sins bound
us: the south wind the Holy Spirit hath blown: our sins are forgiven us, we are released from
the frost of iniquity; as the ice in fair weather, our sins are melted. Let us run unto our
country, as the torrents in the south.…
8. For the next words are, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy” (ver. 5). In this life,
which is full of tears, let us sow. What shall we sow? Good works. Works of mercy are our
seeds: of which seeds the Apostle saith, “Let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season
we shall reap if we faint not.”5502 Speaking therefore of almsgiving itself, what saith he?
“This I say; he that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly.”5503 He therefore who soweth
plentifully, shall reap plentifully: he who soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly: and he
that soweth nothing, shall reap nothing. Why do ye long for ample estates, where ye may
sow plentifully? There is not a wider field on which ye can sow than Christ, who hath willed
that we should sow in Himself. Your soil is the Church; sow as much as ye can. But thou
hast not enough to do this. Hast thou the will? 5504 As what thou hadst would be nothing,
if thou hadst not a good will; so do not despond, because thou hast not, if thou hast a good
will. For what dost thou sow? Mercy. And what wilt thou reap? Peace. Said the Angels, Peace
on earth unto rich men? No, but, “Peace on earth unto men of a good will.”5505 Zacchæus
had a strong will, Zacchæus had great charity.5506…Did then that widow who cast her two

Psalm CXXVI
farthings into the treasury, sow little? Nay, as much as Zacchæus. For she had narrower
means, but an equal will. She gave her two mites5507 with as good a will as Zacchæus gave
the half of his patrimony. If thou consider what they gave, thou wilt find their gifts different;
if thou look to the source, thou wilt find them equal; she gave whatever she had, and he gave
what he had.…But if they are beggars whose profession is asking alms, in trouble they also
have what to bestow upon one another. God hath not so forsaken them, but that they have
wherein they may be tried by their bestowing of alms. This man cannot walk; he who can
walk, lendeth his feet to the lame; he who seeth, lendeth his eyes to the blind; and he who
is young and sound, lendeth his strength to the old or the infirm, carrieth him: the one is
poor, the other is rich.
9. Sometimes also the rich man is found to be poor, and something is bestowed upon
him by the poor. Somebody cometh to a river, so much the more delicate as he is more rich;
he cannot pass over: if he were to pass over with bare limbs, he would catch cold, would be
ill, would die: a poor man more active in body cometh up: he carries the rich man over; he
giveth alms unto the rich. Think not therefore those only poor, who have not money.…Thus
love ye, thus be ye affectioned unto one another. Attend not solely to yourselves: but to
those who are in want around you. But because these things take place in this life with
troubles and cares, faint not. Ye sow in tears, ye shall reap in joy.
10. How, my brethren? When the farmer goeth forth with the plough, carrying seed, is
not the wind sometimes keen, and doth not the shower sometimes deter him? He looketh
to the sky, seeth it lowering, shivers with cold, nevertheless goeth forth, and soweth. For he
feareth lest while he is observing the foul weather, and awaiting sunshine, the time may pass
away, and he may not find anything to reap. Put not off, my brethren; sow in wintry
weather, sow good works, even while ye weep; for, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.”
They sow their seed, good will, and good works. “They went on their way and wept, casting
their seed” (ver. 6). Why did they weep? Because they were among the miserable, and were
themselves miserable. It is better, my brethren, that no man should be miserable, than that
thou shouldest do alms.…Nevertheless, as long as there are objects for its exercise, let us
not fail amid those troubles to sow our seed. Although we sow in tears, yet shall we reap in
joy. For in that resurrection of the dead, each man shall receive his own sheaves, that is, the
produce of his seed, the crown of joys and of delight. Then will there be a joyous triumph,
when we shall laugh at death, wherein we groaned before: then shall they say to death, “O
death, where is thy strife? O death, where is thy sting?”5508 But why do they now rejoice?
Because “they bring their sheaves with them.”
5507 Luke xxi. 1–4.
5508 1 Cor. xv. 55.
Psalm CXXVI
11. In this Psalm we have chiefly exhorted you to do deeds of alms, because it is thence
that we ascend; and ye see that he who ascendeth, singeth the song of steps. Remember: do
not love to descend, instead of to ascend, but reflect upon your ascent: because he who
descended from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among thieves.5509…The Samaritan as He passed
by slighted us not: He healed us, He raised us upon His beast, upon His flesh; He led us to
the inn, that is, the Church; He entrusted us to the host, that is, to the Apostle; He gave two
pence, whereby we might be healed,5510 the love of God, and the love of our neighbour.
The Apostle spent more; for, though it was allowed unto all the Apostles to receive, as Christ’s
soldiers, pay from Christ’s subjects,5511 that Apostle, nevertheless, toiled with his own hands,
and excused the subjects the maintenance owing to him.5512 All this hath already happened:
if we have descended, and have been wounded; let us ascend, let us sing, and make progress,
in order that we may arrive.

Psalm CXXVI
Psalm CXXVII.5513
1. Among all the Songs entitled the Song of degrees, this Psalm hath a further addition
in the title, that it is “Solomon’s.” For thus it is entitled, “A Song of degrees of Solomon.” It
hath therefore aroused our attention, and caused us to enquire the reason of this addition,
“of Solomon.” For it is needless to repeat explanations of the other words, Song of de-
grees.…Solomon was in his time David’s son, a great man, through whom many holy precepts
and healthful admonitions and divine mysteries have been wrought by the Holy Spirit in
the Scriptures. Solomon himself was a lover of women, and was rejected by God: and this
lust was so great a snare unto him, that he was induced by women even to sacrifice to
idols,5514 as Scripture witnesseth concerning him. But if, by his fall what was delivered
through him were blotted out, it would be judged that he had himself delivered these precepts,
and not that they were delivered through him. The mercy of God, therefore, and His Spirit,
excellently wrought that whatever of good was declared through Solomon, might be attributed
unto God; and the man’s sin, unto the man. What marvel that Solomon fell among God’s
people? Did not Adam fall in Paradise? Did not an angel fall from heaven, and become the
devil? We are thereby taught, that no hope must be placed in any among men.…The name
of Solomon is interpreted to mean peacemaker: now Christ is the True Peacemaker, of
whom the Apostle saith, “He is our Peace, who hath made both one.”5515…Since, therefore,
He is the true Solomon; for that Solomon was the figure of this Peace maker, when he built
the temple; that thou mayest not think he who built the house unto God was the true So-
lomon, Scripture showing unto thee another Solomon, thus commences this Psalm: “Except
the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it” (ver. 1). The Lord, therefore,
buildeth the house, the Lord Jesus Christ buildeth His own house. Many toil in building:
but, except He build, “their labour is but lost that build it.” Who are they who toil in building
it? All who preach the word of God in the Church, the ministers of God’s mysteries. We are
all running, we are all toiling, we are all building now; and before us others have run, toiled,
and built: but “except the Lord build, their labour is but lost.” Thus the Apostles seeing some
fall bewailed these men, in that they had laboured in vain for them.5516 We, therefore, speak
without, He buildeth within. We can observe with what attention ye hear us; He alone who
knoweth your thoughts, knoweth what ye think. He Himself buildeth, He Himself admon-
isheth, He Himself openeth the understanding, He Himself kindleth your understanding
unto faith; nevertheless, we also toil like workmen; but, “except the Lord build,” etc.

Psalm CXXVII
2. But that which is the house of God is also a city. For the house of God is the people
of God; for the house of God is the temple of God.…This is Jerusalem: she hath guards: as
she hath builders, labouring at her building up, so also hath she guards. To this guardianship
these words of the Apostle relate: “I fear, lest by any means your minds should be corrupted
from the simplicity which is in Christ.”5517 He was guarding the Church. He kept watch,
to the utmost of his power, over those over whom he was set. The Bishops also do this. For
a higher place was for this reason given the Bishops, that they might be themselves the su-
perintendents and as it were the guardians of the people. For the Greek word Episcopus,
and the vernacular Superintendent, are the same; for the Bishop superintends, in that he
looks over. As a higher place is assigned to the vinedresser in the charge of the vineyard, so
also to the Bishops a more exalted station is alloted. And a perilous account is rendered of
this high station, except we stand here with a heart that causeth us to stand beneath your
feet in humility, and pray for you, that He who knoweth your minds may be Himself your
keeper. Since we can see you both coming in and going out; but we are so unable to see what
are the thoughts of your hearts, that we cannot even see what ye do in your houses. How
then can we guard you? As men: as far as we are able, as far as we have received power. And
because we guard you like men, and cannot guard you perfectly, shall ye therefore remain
without a keeper? Far be it! For where is He of whom it is said, “Except the Lord keep the
city, the watchman waketh but in vain?” (ver. 1). We are watchful on our guard, but vain
in our watchfulness, except He who seeth your thoughts guard you. He keepeth guard while
ye are awake, He keepeth guard also whilst ye are asleep. For He hath once slept on the
Cross, and hath risen again; He no longer sleepeth. Be ye Israel: for “the Keeper of Israel
neither sleepeth nor slumbereth.”5518 Yea, brethren, if we wish to be kept beneath the
shadow of God’s wings, let us be Israel. For we guard you in our office of stewards; but we
wish to be guarded together with you. We are as it were shepherds unto you; but beneath
that Shepherd we are fellow-sheep with you. We are as it were your teachers from this station;
but beneath Him, the One Master, we are schoolfellows with you in this school.
3. If we wish to be guarded by Him who was humbled for our sakes, and who was exalted
to keep us, let us be humble. Let no one assume anything unto himself. No man hath any
good, except he hath received it from Him who alone is good. But he who chooseth to arrog-
ate wisdom unto himself, is a fool. Let him be humble, that wisdom may come, and may
enlighten him. But if, before wisdom cometh unto him, he imagine that he is wise; he riseth
before light, and walketh in darkness. What doth he hear in this Psalm? “It is but lost labour
that ye haste to rise up before dawn” (ver. 2). What meaneth this? If ye arise before light
ariseth, ye must needs lose your labour, because ye will be in the dark. Our light, Christ,
5517 2 Cor. xi. 3.
5518 Ps. cxxi. 4.
Psalm CXXVII
hath arisen; it is good for thee to rise after Christ, not to rise before Christ. Who rise before
Christ? They who choose to prefer themselves to Christ. And who are they who wish to
prefer themselves to Christ? They who wish to be exalted here, where He was humble. Let
them, therefore, be humble here, if they wish to be exalted there, where Christ is exal-
ted.…The Lord recalled the sons of Zebedee to humility, and said unto them, “Are ye able
to drink of the cup that I shall drink of?”5519 I came to be humble: and are ye wishing to be
exalted before Me? The way I go, do ye follow, He saith. For if ye choose to go this way
where I do not go, your labour is lost, in rising before dawn. Peter too had risen before the
light, when he wished to give the Lord advice, deterring Him from suffering for us.…But
what did our Lord do? He caused him to rise after the Light: “Get thee behind Me, Satan.”5520
He was Satan, because he wished to rise before Light. “Get thee behind Me:” that I may
precede, thou mayest follow: where I go, there thou mayest go; and mayest not wish to lead
Me, where thou wouldest go.…
4. And as if thou shouldest say, When shall we rise? we are ordered now to sit: when
will be our rising? When the Lord’s was. Look unto Him, who went before thee: for if thou
heedest not Him, “it is lost labour for thee to rise before dawn.” When was He raised? When
He had died. Hope therefore for thine uplifting after thy death: have hope in the resurrection
of the dead, because He rose again and ascended. But where did He sleep? On the Cross.
When He slept on the Cross, He bore a sign, yea, He fulfilled what had been signified in
Adam: for when Adam was asleep, a rib was drawn from him and Eve was created;5521 so
also while the Lord slept on the Cross, His side was transfixed with a spear, and the Sacra-
ments flowed forth,5522 whence the Church was born. For the Church the Lord’s Bride was
created from His side, as Eve was created from the side of Adam. But as she was made from
his side no otherwise than while sleeping, so the Church was created from His side no oth-
erwise than while dying. If therefore He rose not from the dead save when He had died,
dost thou hope for exaltation save after this life? But that this Psalm might teach thee, in
case thou shouldest ask, When shall I rise? perhaps before I have sat down? he addeth,
“When He hath given His beloved sleep” (ver. 3). God giveth this when His beloved have
fallen asleep; then His beloved, that is, Christ’s, shall rise. For all indeed shall rise, but not
as His beloved. There is a resurrection of all the dead; but what saith the Apostle? “We shall
all rise, but we shall not all be changed.”5523 They rise unto punishment: we rise as our Lord
rose, that we may follow our Head, if we are members of Him.…Hope for such a resurrection;

and for the sake of this be a Christian, not for the sake of this world’s happiness. For if thou
wish to be a Christian for the sake of this world’s happiness, since He thy Light sought not
worldly happiness; thou art wishing to rise before the light; thou must needs continue in
darkness. Be changed, follow thy Light; rise where 5524 He rose again: first sit down, and
thus rise, “when He giveth His beloved sleep.”
5. As if thou shouldest ask again, who are the beloved? “Lo, children, the reward of the
fruit of the womb, are an heritage of the Lord”5525 (ver. 3). Since he saith, “fruit of the
womb,” these children have been born in travail. There is a certain woman, in whom what
was said unto Eve, “in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children,” is shown after a spiritual
manner. The Church beareth children, the Bride of Christ; and if she beareth them, she
travaileth of them. In figure of her, Eve was called also “the Mother of all living.”5526 He
who said, “My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in
you,”5527 was amongst the members of her who travaileth. But she travailed not in vain,
nor brought forth in vain: there will be a holy seed at the resurrection of the dead: the
righteous who are at present scattered over the whole world shall abound. The Church
groaneth for them, the Church travaileth of them; but in that resurrection of the dead, the
offspring of the Church shall appear, pain and groaning shall pass away.…
6. “Like as the arrows in the hand of the mighty one, even so are the children of those
that are shot out” (ver. 4). Whence hath sprung this heritage, brethren? Whence hath sprung
so numerous a heritage? Some have been shot out from the Lord’s hand, as arrows, and
have gone far, and have filled the whole earth, whence the Saints spring. For this is the her-
itage whereof it is said, “Desire of Me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”5528 And how doth this possession
extend and increase unto the world’s uttermost parts? Because, “like as the arrows in the
hand of the mighty one,” etc. Arrows are shot forth from the bow, and the stronger the arm
which hath sent it forth, the farther flieth the arrow. But what is stronger than the darting
of the Lord? From His bow He sendeth forth His Apostles: there could not be a spot left
where an arrow shot by so strong an arm would not reach; it hath reached unto the uttermost
parts of the earth. The reason it went no farther was, that there were no more of the human
race beyond. For He hath such strength, that even if there were a spot beyond, whither the
5524 So Oxf. mss. qua resurrexit. Ben. quare surrexit.
5525 Perhaps he intends to read it, “Lo, children, the heritage of the Lord, is the reward of the fruit of the
womb;” making filii vocative.

5528 Ps. ii. 8.
Psalm CXXVII
arrow could fly, He would dart the arrow thither. Such are the children of those who are
shot forth as they that are shot forth.5529…
7. Perhaps the Apostles themselves are styled the sons of those who have been shaken
out, the sons of the Prophets. For the Prophets comprised closed and covered mysteries:
they were shaken, that they might come forth thence manifestly.…Except the prophecy in-
volved were sifted with diligence, would the concealed meanings come forth unto us? All
these meanings were therefore closed before the Lord’s advent. The Lord came, and shook
out these hidden meanings, and they were made manifest; the Prophets were shaken out,
and the Apostles were born. Since then they were born of the Prophets who had been shaken
out, the Apostles are sons of those that were shaken out. They, placed as the arrows in the
hand of the giant, have reached the uttermost parts of the earth.…The Apostles the sons of
the Prophets have been like as the arrows in the hand of a mighty one. If He is mighty, He
hath shaken them out with a mighty hand; if He hath shaken them out with a mighty hand,
they whom He hath shaken forth have arrived even at the uttermost parts of the earth.
8. “Blessed is the man who hath filled his desire from them” (ver. 5). Well, my brethren,
who filleth his desire from them? Who loveth not the world. He who is filled with the desire
of the world, hath no room for that to enter which they have preached. Pour forth what
thou carriest, and become fit for that which thou hast not. That is, thou desirest riches: thou
canst not fill thy desire from them: thou desirest honours upon earth, thou desirest those
things which God hath given even unto beasts of burden, that is, temporal pleasure, bodily
health, and the like; thou wilt not fulfil thy desire from them.…“He shall not be ashamed,
when he speaketh with his enemies in the gate.” Brethren, let us speak in the gate, that is,
let all know what we speak. For he who chooseth not to speak in the gate, wisheth what he
speaketh to be hidden, and perhaps wisheth it to be hidden for this reason, that it is evil. If
he be confident, let him speak in the gate; as it is said of Wisdom, “She crieth at the gates,
at the entry of the city.”5530 As long as they hold unto righteousness in innocency, they shall
not be ashamed: this is to preach at the gate. And who is he who preacheth at the gate? He
who preacheth in Christ; because Christ is the gate whereby we enter into that
city.5531…They, therefore, who speak against Christ, are without the gate; because they seek
their own honours, not those of Christ. But he who preacheth in the gate, seeketh Christ’s
honour, not his own: and, therefore, he who preacheth in the gate, saith, Trust not in me;
for ye will not enter through me, but through the gate. While they who wish men to trust

in themselves, wish them not to enter through the gate: it is no marvel if the gate be closed
against them, and if they vainly knock for it to be opened.5532

Psalm CXXVII
Psalm CXXVIII.5533
1. Felix the Martyr,5534 truly Felix, i.e. “Happy” both in his name and his crown, whose
birthday this is, despised the world. Was he, because he feared the Lord, thence happy,
thence blessed, because his wife was as a fruitful vine upon the earth, and his children stood
around his table? All these blessings he hath perfectly, but in the Body of Him who is here
described; and, because he understood them in this sense, he scorned things present, that
he might receive things future. Ye are aware, brethren, that he suffered not the death that
other martyrs suffered. For he confessed, and was set aside for torments; on another day
his body was discovered lifeless. They had closed the prison to his body, not to his spirit.
The executioners found him gone; when they were preparing to torture, they spent their
rage for nought. He was lying dead, without sense to them, that he might not be tortured;
with sense with God, that he might be crowned. Whence was he also happy, brethren, not
only in name, but in the reward of everlasting life, if he loved these things.
2. “Blessed are all they that fear the Lord, and walk in His ways” (ver. 1). He speaketh
to many; but since these many are one in Christ, in the next words he speaketh in the singular:
“For thou shalt eat the labours of thy fruits.”…When I speak of Christians in the plural, I
understand one in the One Christ. Ye are therefore many, and ye are one; we are many, and
we are one. How are we many, and yet one? Because we cling unto Him whose members
we are; and since our Head is in heaven, that His members may follow.…Let us therefore
so hear this Psalm, as considering it to be spoken of Christ: and all of us who cling unto the
Body of Christ, and have been made members of Christ, walk in the ways of the Lord; and
let us fear the Lord with a chaste fear, with a fear that abideth for ever.…
3. “Thou shalt eat the labours of thy fruits” (ver. 2). And ye, O thou, ye many who are
One, “Thou shalt eat of the labours of thy fruits.” He seemeth to speak perversely to those
who understand not: for he should have said, thou shalt eat the fruit of thy labours. For
many eat the fruit of their labours. They labour in the vineyard; they eat not the toil itself;
but what ariseth from their labour they eat. They labour about trees that bear fruit: who
would eat labours? But the fruit of these labours, the produce of these trees; it is this that
delighteth the husbandman. What meaneth, “Thou shalt eat the labours of thy fruits”? At
present we have toils: the fruits will come afterwards. But since their labours themselves are
not without joy, on account of the hope whereof we have a little before spoken, “Rejoicing
in hope, patient in tribulation;” 5535 at present those very labours delight us, and make us

Psalm CXXVIII
joyful in hope. If therefore our toil has been what could be eaten, and could also delight us;
what will be the fruit of our labour when eaten? “They who went weeping on their way,
scattering their seed,”5536 did eat their labours; with how much greater pleasure will they
eat the fruits of their labours, who “shall come again with joy, bearing their sheaves with
them”?…“Blessed art thou, and well shall it be with thee.” “Blessed art thou,” is of the present:
“well shall it be with thee,” is of the future. When thou eatest the labours of thy fruits, “blessed
art thou;” when thou hast reached the fruit of thy labours, “well shall it be with thee.” What
hath he said? For if it be well with thee, thou wilt be happy: and if thou wilt be happy, thou
wilt also have all well with thee. But there is a difference between hope and attainment. If
hope be so sweet, how much sweeter will reality be?
4. Let us now come to the words, “Thy wife” (ver. 3): it is said unto Christ. His wife,
therefore, is the Church: His Church, His wife, we ourselves are. “As a fruitful vineyard.”
But in whom is the vineyard fruitful? For we see many barren ones entering those walls; we
see that many intemperate, usurious persons, slave dealers, enter these walls, and such as
resort to fortune-tellers, go to enchanters and enchantresses when they have a headache. Is
this the fruitfulness of the vine? Is this the fecundity of the wife? It is not. These are thorns,
but the vineyard is not everywhere thorny. It hath a certain fruitfulness, and is a fruitful
vine; but in whom? “Upon the sides of thy house.” Not all are called the sides of the house.
For I ask what are the sides. What shall I say? Are they walls, strong stones, as it were? If he
were speaking of this bodily tenement, we should perhaps understand this by sides. We
mean by the sides of the house, those who cling unto Christ.…
5. “Thy children.” The wife and the children are the same. In these carnal marriages
and wedlocks, the wife is one, the children other: in the Church, she who is the wife, is the
children also. For the Apostles belonged to the Church, and were among the members of
the Church. They were therefore in His wife, and were His wife according to their own
portion which they held in His members. Why then is it said concerning them, “When the
Bridegroom shall be taken from them, then shall the children of the Bridegroom fast”?5537
She who is the wife, then, is the children also. I speak a wonderful thing, my brethren. In
the words of the Lord, we find the Church to be both His brethren, and His sisters, and His
mother.5538…For Mary was among the sides of His House, and His relatives coming of the
kindred of the Virgin Mary, who believed on Him, were among the sides of His House; not
in respect of their carnal consanguinity, but inasmuch as they heard the Word of God, and
obeyed it.…He added; “For whosoever shall do the will of My Father which is in heaven,
the same is My brother, and sister, and mother.”5539 “Brother,” perhaps, on account of the

Psalm CXXVIII
male sex whom the Church hath: “sister,” on account of the women whom Christ hath here
in His members. How “mother,” save that Christ Himself is in those Christians, whom the
Church daily bringeth forth Christians through baptism? In those therefore in whom thou
understandest the wife, in them thou understandest the mother, in them the children.
6. …Such children ought therefore to be “around” the Lord’s “table, like olive-
branches.”5540 A complete Vine it is, a great bliss: who would now refuse to be there? When
thou seest any blasphemer have a wife, children, grandchildren, and thyself perchance
without them, envy them not; discern that the promise hath been fulfilled in thee also, but
spiritually. If therefore we have, why have we? Because we fear the Lord. “Lo, thus shall the
man be blessed that feareth the Lord” (ver. 4). He is the man, who is also the men; and the
men are one man; because many are one, because Christ is One.
7. “The Lord from out of Sion bless thee: and mayest thou see thee good things that are
of Jerusalem” (ver. 5). Even to the birds was it said, “Be fruitful and multiply.”5541 Dost thou
wish to hold as a great blessing what was given unto birds? Who can be ignorant, that it was
given indeed by the voice of God? But use these goods, if thou receive them; and rather
think how thou mayest nourish those who have been born, than that others may be born.
For it is not happiness to have children, but to have good ones. Labour in the task of nour-
ishing them, if they be born; but if they be not born, give thanks unto God.…Thy children
are infants: thou dost caress the infants: the infants caress thee: do they abide thus? But thou
wishest they may grow, thou wishest that their age may increase. But consider that when
one age cometh, another dieth. When boyhood cometh, infancy dieth; when youth cometh,
boyhood dieth: when manhood cometh, youth dieth; when old age cometh, manhood dieth:
when death cometh, all age dieth. As many successions of ages as thou wishest for, so many
deaths of ages dost thou wish for. These things therefore “are” not. Finally, are children
born unto thee to share life with thee on earth, or rather to shut thee out and to succeed
thee? Rejoicest thou in those born to exclude thee? Boys when born speak somewhat like
this to their parents: “Now then, begin to think of removing hence, let us too play our parts
on the stage.” For the whole life of temptation in the human race is a stage play;5542 for it
is said, “Every man living is altogether vanity.”5543 Nevertheless, if we rejoice in children
who will succeed us; how much must we rejoice in children with whom we shall remain,
and in that Father for whom we are born, who will not die, but that we may evermore live
with Him? These are the good things of Jerusalem: for they “are.” And how long shall I see

Psalm CXXVIII
the good things of Jerusalem? “All thy life long.” If thy life be for ever, thou wilt see the good
things of Jerusalem for evermore.…
8. For, “if in this life only,” saith the Apostle, “we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
most miserable.”5544 For what reason were the Martyrs condemned to beasts? What is that
good? Can it be declared? by what means, or what tongue can tell it? or what ears can hear
it? That indeed, “Neither ear hath heard, nor hath it entered into man’s heart:”5545 only let
us love, only let us grow in grace: ye see, then, that battles are not wanting, and that we fight
with our lusts. We fight outwardly with unbelieving and disobedient men; we fight inwardly
with carnal suggestions and perturbations: we everywhere as yet fight.…What sort of peace
then is this? One from Jerusalem, for Jerusalem is interpreted, A vision of Peace. Thus then
“mayest thou see the good things that are of Jerusalem,” and that, “all thy life long—and
mayest thou see,” not only thy children, but, “thy children’s children.” What meaneth, Thy
children? Thy works which thou here dost. Who are thy children’s children? The fruits of
thy works. Thou givest alms: these are thy children: for the sake of thine alms thou receivest
everlasting life, these are thy children’s children. “Mayest thou see thy children’s children;”
and there shall be “peace upon Israel” (ver. 6), the last words of the Psalm.…

Psalm CXXVIII
Psalm CXXIX.5546
1. The Psalm which we have sung is short: but as it is written in the Gospel of Zacchæus
that he was “little of stature,”5547 but mighty in works; as it is written of that widow who
cast two mites into the treasury, little was the money, but great was her charity;5548 thus
also this Psalm, if thou count the words, is short; if thou weigh the sentiments, is great.…Let
the Spirit of God speak, let It speak to us, let It sing to us; whether we wish or wish not to
dance, let It sing. For as he who danceth, moveth his limbs to the time; so they who dance
according to the commandment of God, in their works obey the sound. What therefore
saith the Lord in the Gospel to those who refuse to do this? “We have piped unto you, and
ye have not danced: we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.”5549 Let Him
therefore sing; we trust in God’s mercy, for there will be those by whom He consoleth us.
For they who are obstinate, continuing in wickedness, although they hear the Word of God,
by their offences daily disturb the Church. Of such this Psalm speaketh; for thus it beginneth.
2. “Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up” (ver. 1). The Church
speaketh of those whom She endureth: and as if it were asked, “Is it now?” The Church is
of ancient birth: since saints have been so called, the Church hath been on earth. At one
time the Church was in Abel only, and he was fought against by his wicked and lost brother
Cain.5550 At one time the Church was in Enoch alone: and he was translated from the un-
righteous.5551 At one time the Church was in the house of Noah alone, and endured all who
perished by the flood, and the ark alone swam upon the waves, and escaped to shore.5552
At one time the Church was in Abraham alone, and we know what he endured from the
wicked. The Church was in his brother’s son, Lot, alone, and in his house, in Sodom, and
he endured the iniquities and perversities of Sodom, until God freed him from amidst
them.5553 The Church also began to exist in the people of Israel: She endured Pharaoh and
the Egyptians. The number of the saints began to be also in the Church, that is, in the people
of Israel; Moses and the rest of the saints endured the wicked Jews, the people of Israel. We
come unto our Lord Jesus Christ: the Gospel was preached in the Psalms.5554…For this
reason, lest the Church wonder now, or lest any one wonder in the Church, who wisheth

to be a good member of the Church, let him hear the Church herself his Mother saying to
him, Marvel not at these things, my son: “Many a time have they fought against me from
my youth up.”
3. “Now may Israel say.” She now seemeth to be speaking of herself: for she seemed not
to have commenced herself, but to have answered. But to whom hath she replied? To them
that think and say, How great evils do we endure, how great are the scandals that every day
thicken, as the wicked enter into the Church, and we have to endure them? But let the
Church reply through some, that is, through the voice of the stronger, let her reply to the
complaints of the weak, and let the stable confirm the unstable, and the full-grown the infant,
and let the Church say, “Many a time have they vexed me from my youth up” (ver. 2). Let
the Church say this: let her not fear it. For what is the meaning of this addition, “From my
youth up,” after the words, “Many a time have they fought against me”? At present the old
age of the Church is assailed: but let her not fear. Hath she then failed to arrive at old age,
because they have not ceased to fight against her from her youth up? have they been able to
blot her out? Let Israel comfort herself, let the Church console herself with past examples.
Why have they fought against me? “For they could not prevail against me.”
4. “Upon my back have sinners built; they have done their iniquity afar off” (ver. 3).
Why have they fought against me? Because “they could not prevail upon me.” What is this?
They could not build upon me. I consented not with them unto sin. For every wicked man
persecuteth the good on this account, because the good man consenteth not with him to
evil. Suppose he do some evil, and the Bishop censure him not, the Bishop is a good man:
suppose the Bishop censure him, the Bishop is a bad man. Suppose he carry off anything,
let the man robbed be silent, he is a good man: let him only speak and rebuke, even though
he doth not reclaim his goods, he is everything bad. He is bad then who blameth the robber,
and he is good who robbeth!…Heed not that such an one speaketh to thee: it is a wicked
man through whom It speaketh to thee; but the word of God, that speaketh to thee, is not
wicked. 5555 Accuse God: accuse Him, if thou canst!
5. Thou accusest a man of avarice, and he accuseth God on the ground that He made
gold. Be not covetous. And God, thou repliest, should not make gold. This now remaineth,
because thou canst not restrain thine evil deeds, thou accusest the good works of God: the
Creator and Architect of the world displeaseth thee. He ought not to make the sun either;
for many contend concerning the lights of their windows, and drag each other before courts
of law. O if we could restrain our vices! for all things are good, because a good God made
all things: and His works praise Him, when their goodness is considered by him who hath
the spirit of considering them, the spirit of piety and wisdom.5556…
5555 Oxf. mss. “Heed not through whom It speaketh to thee, but take heed that it is That which speaketh to
thee. He is evil through whom It speaketh to thee, but the Word of God that speaketh to thee is not evil.”

Psalm CXXIX
6. Lend not money at interest. Thou accusest Scripture which saith, “He that hath not
given his money upon usury.”5557 I wrote not this: it went not forth first from my mouth:
hear God. He replieth: let not the clergy lend upon usury. Perchance he who speaketh to
thee, lendeth not at interest: but if he do so lend, suppose that he doth so lend; doth He who
speaketh through him lend at interest? If he doth what he enjoineth thee, and thou dost it
not; thou wilt go into the flame, he into the kingdom. If he doth not what he enjoineth thee,
and equally with thee doth evil deeds, and preaches duties which he doth not; ye will both
equally go into the flames. The hay will burn; but “the word of the Lord abideth for ever-
more.”5558…
7. “The righteous Lord shall hew the necks of the sinners” (ver. 4).…Which of us doth
not fix his eyes upon the earth, like the Publican, and say, “Lord, be merciful unto me a
sinner”?5559 If therefore all are sinners, and none is found without sin; all must fear the
sword that hangs above their neck, because “the righteous Lord shall hew the necks of the
sinners.” I do not imagine, my brethren, of all sinners; but in the member which He striketh,
He marks what sinners He striketh. For it is not said, The righteous Lord will hew the hands
of the sinners; or their feet; but because proud sinners were meant to be understood, and
all proud men carry lofty necks, and not only do evil deeds, but even refuse to acknowledge
them to be such, and when they are rebuked, justify themselves:5560…as it is written in Job
(he was speaking of an ungodly sinner), “he runneth against God, even upon his neck, upon
the thick bosses of his bucklers;”5561 so he here nameth the neck, because it is thus thou
exaltest thyself, and dost not fix thine eyes upon the ground, and beat thy breast. Thou
shouldest cry unto Him, as it is cried in another Psalm, “I said, Lord, be merciful unto me,
for I have sinned against Thee.”5562 Since thou dost not choose to say this, but justifiest thy
deeds against the Word of God; what followeth in Scripture cometh upon thee: the righteous
Lord shall hew the necks of sinners.
8. “Let them be confounded and turned backward, as many as have evil will at Sion”
(ver. 5). They who hate Sion, hate the Church: Sion is the Church. And they who hypocrit-
ically enter into the Church, hate the Church. They who refuse to keep the Word of God,
hate the Church: “Upon my back have they built:” what will the Church do, save endure the
burden even unto the end?

9. But what saith he of them? The next words are, “Let them be even as the grass of the
house tops: that withereth before it be plucked up” (ver. 6). The grass of the house tops is
that which groweth on house tops, on a tiled roof: it is seen on high, and hath not a root.
How much better would it be if it grew lower, and how much more joyfully would it bloom?
As it is, it riseth higher to a quicker withering. It hath not yet been plucked up, yet hath it
withered: not yet have they received sentence from the judgment of God, and already they
have not the sap of bloom. Observe their works, and see that they have withered.…The
reapers will come, but they fill not their sheaves from these. For the reapers will come, and
will gather the wheat into the barn, and will bind the tares together, and cast them into the
fire. Thus also is the grass of the house tops cleared off, and whatever is plucked from it, is
thrown into the fire; because it had withered even before it was plucked up. The reaper filleth
not his hands thence. His next words are, “Whereof the reaper filleth not his hand; neither
he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom” (ver. 7). And, “the reapers are the angels,”5563
the Lord saith.
10. “So that they who go by say not so much as, The blessing of the Lord be upon you:
we have blessed you in the name of the Lord” (ver. 8). For ye know, brethren, when men
pass by others at work, it is customary to address them, “The blessing of the Lord be upon
you.”5564 And this was especially the custom in the Jewish nation. No one passed by and
saw any one doing any work in the field, or in the vineyard, or in harvest, or anything of
the sort; it was not lawful to pass by without a blessing.…Who are the passers by? They who
have already passed hence to their country through this road, that is, through this life: the
Apostles were passers by in this life, the Prophets were passers by. Whom did the Prophets
and Apostles bless? Those in whom they saw the root of charity? But those whom they found
lifted on high on their house tops, and proud in the bosses of their bucklers, they declared
against these what they were doomed to become, but they gave them no blessing. Ye therefore
who read in the Scriptures, find all those wicked men whom the Church beareth, who are
declared cursed, pertain unto Antichrist, pertain unto the devil, pertain to the chaff, pertain
to the tares.…But they who say, None save God sanctifieth, nor is any man good save by
the gift of God; they bless in the name of the Lord, not in their own name: because they are
the friends of the bridegroom,5565 they refuse to be adulterers of the bride.

Psalm CXXIX
Psalm CXXX.5566
1. “Out of the deep have I called unto Thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice” (ver. 1). Jonas
cried from the deep; from the whale’s belly.5567 He was not only beneath the waves, but also
in the entrails of the beast; nevertheless, those waves and that body prevented not his prayer
from reaching God, and the beast’s belly could not contain the voice of his prayer. It penet-
rated all things, it burst through all things, it reached the ears of God: if indeed we ought to
say that, bursting through all things, it reached the ears of God, since the ears of God were
in the heart of him who prayed. For where hath not he God present, whose voice is faithful?
Nevertheless, we also ought to understand from what deep we cry unto the Lord. For this
mortal life is our deep. Whoever hath understood himself to be in the deep, crieth out,
groaneth, sigheth, until he be delivered from the deep, and come unto Him who sitteth
above all the deeps.…For they are very deep in the deep, who do not even cry from the deep.
The Scripture saith, “When the wicked hath reached the depth of evils, he despiseth.” 5568
Now consider, brethren, what sort of deep that is, where God is despised. When each man
seeth himself overwhelmed with daily sins, pressed down by heaps and weights, so to speak,
of iniquities: if it be said unto him, Pray unto God, he laughs. In what manner? He first
saith, If crimes were displeasing unto God, should I live? If God regarded human affairs,
considering the great crimes which I have committed, should I not only live, but be prosper-
ous? For this is wont to happen to those who are far in the deep, and are prosperous in their
iniquities: and they are the more plunged in the deep, in proportion as they seem to be more
happy; for a deceitful happiness is itself a greater unhappiness.…
2. “Lord, hear my voice. O let Thine ears consider well the voice of my complaint” (ver.
2). Whence doth he cry? From the deep. Who is it then who crieth? A sinner. And with
what hope doth he cry? Because He who came to absolve from sins, gave hope even to the
sinner down in the deep. What therefore followeth after these words: “If Thou, Lord, wilt
be extreme to mark what is amiss, O Lord, who may abide it?” (ver. 3). So, he hath disclosed
from what deep he cried out. For he crieth beneath the weights and billows of his iniquit-
ies.…He said not, I may not abide it: but, “who may abide it?” For he saw that nigh the
whole of human life on every side was ever bayed at by its sins, that all consciences were
accused by their thoughts, that a clean heart trusting in its own righteousness could not be
found.
3. But wherefore is there hope? “For there is propitiation with Thee” (ver. 4). And what
is this propitiation, except sacrifice? And what is sacrifice, save that which hath been offered
for us? The pouring forth of innocent blood blotted out all the sins of the guilty: so great a

price paid down redeemed all captives from the hand of the enemy who captured them.
“With Thee,” then, “there is propitiation.” For if there were not mercy with Thee, if Thou
chosest to be Judge only, and didst refuse to be merciful, Thou wouldest mark all our
iniquities, and search after them. Who could abide this? Who could stand before Thee, and
say, I am innocent? Who could stand in Thy judgment? There is therefore one hope: “for
the sake of Thy law have I borne Thee, O Lord.” What law? That which made men guilty.
For a “law, holy, just, and good,” 5569 was given to the Jews; but its effect was to make them
guilty. A law was not given that could give life,5570 but which might show his sins to the
sinner. For the sinner had forgotten himself, and saw not himself; the law was given him,
that he might see himself. The law made him guilty, the Lawgiver freed him: for the Lawgiver
is the Supreme Power.5571…There is therefore a law of the mercy of God, a law of the pro-
pitiation of God.5572 The one was a law of fear, the other is a law of love. The law of love
giveth forgiveness to sins, blotteth out the past, warneth concerning the future; forsaketh
not its companion by the way, becometh a companion to him whom it leadeth on the way.
But it is needful to agree with the adversary, whilst thou art with him in the way.5573 For
the Word of God is thine adversary, as long as thou dost not agree with it. But thou agreest,
when it has begun to be thy delight to do what God’s Word commandeth. Then he who was
thine adversary becometh thy friend: so, when the way is finished, there will be none to de-
liver thee to the Judge. Therefore, “For the sake of Thy law I have waited for Thee, O Lord,”
because thou hast condescended to bring in a law of mercy, to forgive me all my sins, to
give me for the future warnings that I may not offend.…“For the sake,” therefore, “of” this
“law I have waited for Thee, O Lord.” I have waited until Thou mayest come and free me
from all need, for in my very need Thou hast not forsaken the law of mercy.…“My soul hath
waited for Thy word.”…
4. We therefore trust without fear on the word of Him who cannot deceive. “My soul
hath trusted in the Lord, from the morning watch even unto night” (ver. 5). This morning
watch is the end of night. We must therefore understand it so that we may not suppose we
are to trust in the Lord for one day only. What do you conceive to be the sense, then,
brethren? The words mean this: that the Lord, through whom our sins have been remitted,
arose from the dead at the morning watch, so that we may hope that what went before in
the Lord will take place in us. For our sins have been already forgiven: but we have not yet
risen again: if we have not risen again, not as yet hath that taken place in us which went

before in our Head. What went before in our Head? Because the flesh of that Head rose
again; did the Spirit of that Head die? What had died in Him, rose again. Now He arose on
the third day; and the Lord as it were thus speaketh to us: What ye have seen in Me, hope
for in yourselves; that is, because I have risen from the dead, ye also shall rise again.
5. But there are who say, Behold, the Lord hath risen again; but must I hope on that
account that I also may rise again? Certainly, on that account: for the Lord rose again in
that which He assumed from thee. For He would not rise again, save He had died; and He
could not have died, except He bore the flesh. What did the Lord assume from thee? The
flesh. What was He that came Himself? The Word of God, who was before all things, through
whom all things were made. But that He might receive something from thee, “The Word
became flesh, and dwelt among us.”5574 He received from thee, what He might offer for
thee; as the priest receiveth from thee, what he may offer for thee, when thou wishest to
appease God for thy sins. It hath already been done, it hath been done thus. Our Priest re-
ceived from us what He might offer for us: for He received flesh from us, in the flesh itself
He was made a victim, He was made a holocaust, He was made a sacrifice. In the Passion
He was made a sacrifice; in the Resurrection He renewed that which was slain, and offered
it as His first-fruits unto God, and saith unto thee, All that is thine is now consecrated: since
such first-fruits have been offered unto God from thee; hope therefore that that will take
place in thyself which went before in thy first-fruits.
6. Since He then rose with the morning watch, our soul began to hope from hence: and
how far? “Even unto night;” until we die; for all our carnal death is as it were sleep.…
7. And he returns to this, “From the morning watch let Israel hope in the Lord.” Not
only “let Israel hope,” but “from the morning watch let Israel hope.” Do I then blame the
hope of the world, when it is placed in the Lord? No; but there is another hope belonging
to Israel. Let not Israel hope for riches as his highest good, not for health of body, not for
abundance of earthly things: he will indeed have to suffer tribulation here, if it should be
his lot to suffer any troubles for the sake of the truth.…
8. “For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption” (ver. 7).
Admirable! This could not have been better said in its own place, on account of the words,
“From the morning watch.” Wherefore? Because the Lord rose again from the morning
watch; and the body ought to hope for that which went before in the Head. But, lest this
thought should be suggested: The Head might rise again, because It was not weighed down
with sins, there was no sin in Him; what shall we do? Shall we hope for such a resurrection,
as went before in the Lord, whilst we are weighed down by our sins? But see what followeth:
“And He shall redeem Israel from all his sins” (ver. 8). Though therefore he was weighed
down with his sins, the mercy of God is present to him. For this reason, He went before

without sin, that He may blot out the sins of those that follow Him. Trust not in yourselves,
but trust from the morning watch.…
Psalm CXXX
Psalm CXXXI.5575
1. In this Psalm, the humility of one that is a servant of God and faithful is commended
unto us, by whose voice it is sung; which is the whole body of Christ.5576 For we have often
warned you, beloved, that it ought not to be received as the voice of one man singing, but
of all who are in Christ’s Body. And since all are in His Body, as it were one man speaketh:
and he is one who also is many.…Now he prayeth in the temple of God, who prayeth in the
peace of the Church, in the unity of Christ’s Body; which Body of Christ consisteth of many
who believe in the whole world: and therefore he who prayeth in the temple, is heard. For
he prayeth in the spirit and in truth,5577 who prayeth in the peace of the Church; not in that
temple, wherein was the figure.…
2. “Lord, my heart is not lifted up” (ver. 1). He hath offered a sacrifice. Whence do we
prove that he hath offered a sacrifice? Because humility of heart is a sacrifice.…If there is
no sacrifice, there is no Priest. But if we have a High Priest in Heaven, who intercedeth with
the Father for us (for He hath entered into the Holy of Holies, within the veil),…we are safe,
for we have a Priest; let us offer our sacrifice there. Let us consider what sacrifice we ought
to offer; for God is not pleased with burnt-offerings, as ye have heard in the Psalm. But in
that place he next showeth what he offereth: “The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a
broken and a contrite heart, O God, shalt Thou not despise.5578
3. “Lord, my heart was not lifted up, neither were mine eyes raised on high” (ver. 1); “I
have not exercised myself in great matters, nor in wonderful things which are too high for
me” (ver. 2). Let this be more plainly spoken and heard. I have not been proud: I have not
wished to be known among men as for wondrous powers; nor have I sought anything beyond
my strength, whereby I might boast myself among the ignorant. As that Simon the sorcerer
wished to advance into wonders above himself, on that account the power of the Apostles
more pleased him, than the righteousness of Christians.…What is above my strength, he
saith, I have not sought; I have not stretched myself out there, I have not chosen to be
magnified there. How deeply this self-exaltation in the abundance of graces is to be feared,
that no man may pride himself in the gift of God, but may rather preserve humility, and
may do what is written: “The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find
favour before the Lord:”5579 how deeply pride in God’s gift should be feared, we must again
and again impress upon you.…

Psalm CXXXI
Psalm CXXXI
4. “If I had not lowly thoughts, but have lifted up my soul, as one taken from his mother’s
breast, such the reward for my soul” (ver. 2). He seemeth as it were to have bound himself
by a curse:…as though he had been going to say, Let it so happen to me. “As one taken away
from his mother’s breast, may be my soul’s reward.” Ye know that the Apostle saith to some
weak brethren, “I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able
to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.”5580 There are weak persons who are not fit for strong
meat; they wish to grasp at that which they cannot receive: and if they ever do receive, or
seem to themselves to receive what they have not received, they are puffed up thereby, and
become proud thereupon; they seem to themselves wise men. Now this happeneth to all
heretics; who since they were animal and carnal, by defending their depraved opinions,
which they could not see to be false, were shut out of the Catholic Church.…
5. Another opinion indeed hath been entertained, and another sense in these words.…It
has been evidently explained, my brethren, where God would have us to be humble, where
lofty. Humble, in order to provide against pride; lofty, to take in wisdom. Feed upon milk,
that thou mayest be nourished; be nourished, so that thou mayest grow; grow, so that thou
mayest eat bread. But when thou hast begun to eat bread, thou wilt be weaned, that is, thou
wilt no longer have need of milk, but of solid food. This he seemeth to have meant: “If I had
not lowly thoughts, but have lifted up my soul:” that is, if I was not an infant in mind, I was
in wickedness. In this sense, he said before, “Lord, my heart was not lifted up, nor mine eyes
raised on high: I do not exercise myself in great matters, nor in wonderful things above me.”
Behold, in wickedness I am an infant. But since I am not an infant in understanding, “If I
had not lowly thoughts, but have lifted up my soul,” may that reward be mine which is given
unto the infant that is weaned from his mother, that I may at length be able to eat bread.
6. This interpretation, also, brethren, displeaseth me not, since it doth not militate
against the faith. Yet I cannot but remark that it is not only said, “As one taken away from
milk, such may be my soul’s reward;” but with this addition, “As one taken away from milk
when upon his mother’s breast, such may be my soul’s reward.” Here there is somewhat
that induces me to consider it a curse. For it is not an infant, but a grown child that is taken
away from milk; he who is weak in his earliest infancy, which is his true infancy, is upon his
mother’s breast: if perchance he hath been taken away from the milk, he perisheth. It is not
without a reason then that it is added, “Upon his mother’s breast.” For all may be weaned
by growing. He who groweth, and is thus taken away from milk, it is good for him; but
hurtful for him who is still upon his mother’s breast. We must therefore beware, my brethren,
and be fearful, lest any one be taken away from milk before his time.…Let him not therefore
wish to lift up his soul, when perchance he is not fit to take meat, but let him fulfil the
commandments of humility. He hath wherein he may exercise himself: let him believe in
5580 1 Cor. iii. 2.
Psalm CXXXI
Christ, that he may understand Christ. He cannot see the Word, he cannot understand the
equality of the Word with the Father, he cannot as yet see the equality of the Holy Spirit
with the Father and the Word; let him believe this, and suck it. He is safe, because, when he
hath grown, he will eat, which he could not do before he grew by sucking: and he hath a
point to stretch towards. Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, and search not
the things that are above thy strength; that is, things which thou art not as yet fit to under-
stand. And what am I to do? thou repliest. Shall I remain thus? “But what things the Lord
hath commanded thee, think thereupon always.” 5581 What hath the Lord commanded
thee? Do works of mercy, part not with the peace of the Church, place not thy trust in man,
tempt not God by longing for miracles.…
7. For if ye be not exalted, if ye raise not your heart on high, if ye tread not in great
matters that are too high for you, but preserve humility, God will reveal unto you what ye
are otherwise minded in.5582 But if ye choose to defend this very thing, which ye are otherwise
minded about, and with pertinacity assert it, and against the peace of the Church; this curse
which he hath described is entailed upon you; when ye are upon your mother’s breast, and
are removed away from the milk, ye shall die of hunger apart from your mother’s breast.
But if ye continue in Catholic peace, if perchance ye are in anything otherwise minded than
ye ought to be, God will reveal it to you, if ye be humble. Wherefore? Because “God resisteth
the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble.”5583
8. This Psalm therefore concludeth to this purpose: “O Israel, trust in the Lord, from
this time forth and even unto eternity”5584 (ver. 3). But the word seculum doth not always
mean this world, but sometimes eternity; since eternity is understood in two ways; until
eternity, that is, either evermore without end, or until we arrive at eternity. How then is it
to be understood here? Until we arrive at eternity, let us trust in the Lord God; because when
we have reached eternity, there will be no longer hope, but the thing itself will be ours.

Psalm CXXXI
Psalm CXXXII.5585
1. It was right indeed, most beloved, that we should rather hear our Brother,5586 my
colleague, when present before all of us. And just now he refused not, but put us off; for he
extorted from me that he might now listen to me, on the condition that I also may listen to
him, for in charity itself we are all listening unto Him, who is our One Master in heaven.
Attend therefore to the Psalm, entitled A Song of Degrees; considerably longer than the rest
under the same title. Let us not therefore linger, save where necessity shall compel us: that
we may, if the Lord permit, explain the whole. For ye also ought not to hear everything as
men untaught; ye ought in some degree to aid us from your past listenings, so that it may
not be needful that everything should be declared to you as though new.5587
2. “Lord, remember David, and all his meekness” (ver. 1). David according to the truth
of history was one man, king of Israel, son of Jesse. He was indeed meek, as the Divine
Scriptures themselves mark and command him, and so meek that he did not even render
evil for evil to his persecutor Saul. He preserved towards him so great humility, that he ac-
knowledged him a king, and himself a dog: and answered the king not proudly nor rudely,
though he was more powerful in God; but he rather endeavoured to appease him by humility,
than to provoke him by pride. Saul was even given into his power, and this by the Lord God,
that he might do to him what he listed: but since he was not commanded to slay him, but
had it only placed in his power (now a man is permitted to use his power), he rather turned
towards mercy what God gave him.…The humility of David is therefore commended, the
meekness of David is commended; and it is said to God, “Lord, remember David, and all
his meekness.” For what purpose? “How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed a vow unto the
Almighty God of Jacob” (ver. 2). Therefore remember for this, that he may fulfil what he
hath promised. David himself vowed as though he had it in his power, and he prayeth God
to fulfil his vow: there is devotion in the vow, but there is humility in the prayer. Let no one
presume to think he fulfilled by his own strength what he hath vowed. He who exhorteth
thee to vow, Himself aideth thee to fulfil. Let us therefore see what he vowed, and hence we
comprehend how David should be understood in a figure. “David” is interpreted, “Strong
of hand,” for he was a great warrior. Trusting indeed in the Lord his God, he despatched all
wars, he laid low all his enemies, God helping him, according to the dispensation of that
kingdom; prefiguring nevertheless some One strong of hand to destroy His enemies, the
devil and his angels. These enemies the Church warreth against, and conquereth.…What
then doth he mean, “How he sware,” etc.? Let us see what vow is this. We can offer God

Psalm CXXXII
nothing more pleasing than to swear.5588 Now to swear is to promise firmly.5589 Consider
this vow, that is, with what ardour he vowed what he vowed, with what love, with what
longing; nevertheless, he prayeth the Lord to fulfil it in these words, “O Lord, remember
David, and all his meekness.” In this temper he vowed his vow, and there should be a house
of God: “I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, nor climb up into my bed”
(ver. 3). “I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber” (ver. 4). This
seemeth not enough; he adds, “Neither the temples of my head to take any rest, until I find
out a place for the Lord; an habitation for the God of Jacob” (ver. 5). Where did he seek a
place for the Lord? If he was meek, he sought it in himself. For how is one a place for the
Lord? Hear the Prophet: “Upon whom shall My Spirit rest? Even upon him that is poor and
of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My words.”5590 Dost thou wish to be a place for the
Lord? Be thou poor in spirit, and contrite, and trembling at the word of God, and thou wilt
thyself be made what thou seekest. For if what thou seekest be not realized in thyself, what
doth it profit thee in another.…
3. How many thousands believed, my brethren, when they laid down the price of their
possessions at the Apostles’ feet! But what saith Scripture of them? Surely they are become
a temple of God; not only each respectively a temple of God, but also all a temple of God
together. They have therefore become a place for the Lord. And that ye may know that one
place is made for the Lord in all, Scripture saith, They were of one heart and one soul toward
God. 5591 But many, so as not to make a place for the Lord, seek their own things, love their
own things, delight in their own power, are greedy for their private interests. Whereas he
who wisheth to make a place for the Lord, should rejoice not in his private, but the common
good.…
4. Let us therefore, brethren, abstain from the possession of private property; or from
the love of it, if we may not from its possession; and we make a place for the Lord. It is too
much for me, saith some one. But consider who thou art, who art about to make a place for
the Lord. If any senator wished to be entertained at your house, I say not senator, the deputy
of some great man of this world, and should say, something offends me in thy house; though
thou shouldest love it, thou wouldest remove it, nevertheless, lest thou shouldest offend
him, whose friendship thou wast courting. And what doth man’s friendship profit
thee?…Desire the friendship of Christ without fear: He wishes to be entertained at thy house;
make room for Him. What is, make room for Him? Love not thyself, love Him. If thou love

thyself, thou shuttest the door against Him; if thou love Him, thou openest unto Him: and
if thou open and He enter, thou shalt not be lost by loving thyself, but shalt find thyself with

5. “Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata” (ver. 6). What? A place for the Lord. “We heard
of it at Ephrata: and found it in the plains of the forests.”5592 Did he hear it where he found
it? or did he hear it in one place, find it in another? Let us therefore enquire what Ephrata
is, where he heard it; let us also enquire what mean the plains of the forests, where he found
it. Ephrata, a Hebrew word, is rendered in Latin by Speculum,5593 as the translators of
Hebrew words in the Scriptures have handed down to us, that we might understand them.
They have translated from Hebrew into Greek, and from Greek we have versions into Latin.
For there have been who watched in the Scriptures. If therefore Ephrata meaneth a mirror,
that house which was found in the woodland plains, was heard of in a mirror. A mirror hath
an image: all prophecy is an image of things future. The future house of God, therefore, was
declared in the image of prophecy. “We have found it in the plains of the forests.” What are
the “plains of the forests”?5594 Saltus is not here used in its common sense, as a plot of
ground of so many hundred acres;5595 saltus properly signifies a spot as yet untilled and
woody. For some copies read, in the plains of the wood. What then were the woodland
plains, save nations yet untilled? what were they, save regions yet covered with the thorns
of idolatry? Thus, though there were thorns of idolatry there, still we find a place for the
Lord there, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. What was declared in the image to the Jews,
was manifested in the faith of the Gentiles.
6. “We will go into His tabernacles” (ver. 7). Whose? Those of the Lord God of Jacob.
They who enter to dwell therein, are the very same who enter that they may be dwelt in.
Thou enterest into thy house, that thou mayest dwell therein; into the house of God, that
thou mayest be dwelt in. For the Lord is better, and when He hath begun to dwell in thee,
He will make thee happy. For if thou be not dwelt in by Him, thou wilt be miserable. That
son who said, “Father, give me the portion of the goods,” etc.,5596 wished to be his own
master. It was well kept in his father’s hands, that it might not be wasted with harlots. He

received it, it was given into his own power; going to a far country, he squandered it all with
harlots. At length he suffered hunger, he remembered his father; he returned, that he might
be satisfied with bread. Enter therefore, that thou mayest be dwelt in; and mayest be not
thine own, so to speak, but His: “We will go into His tabernacles. We will worship on the
spot where His feet stood.” Whose feet? The Lord’s, or those of the house of the Lord itself?
For that is the Lord’s house, wherein he saith He ought to be worshipped. Beside His house,
the Lord heareth not unto eternal life; for he belongeth to God’s house, who hath in charity
been built in with living stones. But he who hath not charity, falleth; and while he falls, the
house stands.…
7. But if ye incline to understand it of the house itself, where the feet of that house have
stood; let thy feet stand in Christ. They will then stand, if thou shalt persevere in Christ. For
what is said of the devil? “He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the
truth.”5597 The feet of the devil therefore stood not. Also what saith he of the proud? “O let
not the foot of pride come against me; and let not the hand of the ungodly cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and were not able to
stand.”5598 That then is the house of God, whose feet stand. Whence John rejoicing, saith:
what? “He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom standeth
and heareth him.” If he stand not, he heareth him not. Justly he standeth, because “he re-
joiceth on account of the bridegroom’s voice.” Now therefore ye see why they fell, who rejoice
because of their own voice.5599 That friend of the Bridegroom said, “The same is He which
baptizeth.”5600 Some say, We baptize: rejoicing in their own voice, they could not stand;
and belong not to that house of which it is said, “where His feet stood.”
8. “Arise, O Lord, into Thy resting place” (ver. 8). He saith unto the Lord sleeping,
“Arise.” Ye know already who slept, and who rose again.…“Thou, and the ark of Thy sanc-
tification:” that is, Arise, that the ark of Thy sanctification, which Thou hast sanctified, may
arise also. He is our Head; His ark is His Church: He arose first, the Church will arise also.
The body would not dare to promise itself resurrection, save the Head arose first. The Body
of Christ, that was born of Mary, hath been understood by some to be the ark of sanctification;
so that the words mean, Arise with Thy Body, that they who believe not may handle.
9. “Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Thy saints sing with joyfulness”
(ver. 9). When Thou risest from the dead, and goest unto Thy Father, let that royal Priesthood
be clothed with faith, since “the righteous liveth by faith;”5601 and, receiving the pledge of

the Holy Spirit, let the members rejoice in the hope of resurrection, which went before in
the Head: for to them the Apostle saith, “Rejoicing in hope.”5602
10. “For Thy servant David’s sake, turn not away the face of Thine Anointed” (ver. 10).
These words are addressed unto God the Father. “For Thy servant David’s sake, turn not
away the face of Thine Anointed.” The Lord was crucified in Judæa; He was crucified by
the Jews; harassed by them, He slept. He arose to judge those among whose savage hands
He slept: and He saith elsewhere, “Raise Thou Me up again, and I shall reward them.”5603
He both hath rewarded them, and will reward them. The Jews well know themselves how
great were their sufferings after the Lord’s death. They were all expelled from the very city,
where they slew Him. What then? have all perished even from the root of David and from
the tribe of Judah? No: for some of that stock believed, and in fact many thousands of men
of that stock believed, and this after the Lord’s resurrection. They raged and crucified Him:
and afterwards began to see miracles wrought in the Name of Him Crucified; and they
trembled still more that His Name should have so much power, since when in their hands
He seemed unable to work any; and pricked at heart, at length believing that there was some
hidden divinity in Him whom they had believed like other men, and asking counsel of the
Apostles, they were answered, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.”5604 Since then Christ arose to judge those by whom He had been
crucified, and turned away His Presence from the Jews, turning His Presence towards the
Gentiles; God is, as it seemeth, besought in behalf of the remnant of Israel; and it is said
unto Him, “For Thy servant David’s sake, turn not away the presence of Thine Anointed.”
If the chaff be condemned, let the wheat be gathered together. May the remnant be saved,
as Isaiah saith, “And the remnant hath” clearly “been saved:” 5605 for out of them were the
twelve Apostles, out of them more than five hundred brethren, to whom the Lord showed
Himself after His Resurrection:5606 out of their number were so many thousands bap-
tized,5607 who laid the price of their possessions at the Apostles’ feet. Thus then was fulfilled
the prayer here made to God: “For Thy servant David’s sake, turn not away the presence of
Thine Anointed.”
11. “The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David, and He shall not repent” (ver. 11).
What meaneth, “hath made an oath”? Hath confirmed a promise through Himself. What
meaneth, “He shall not repent”? He will not change. For God suffereth not the pain of re-

pentance, nor is He deceived in any matter, so that He would wish to correct that wherein
He hath erred. But as when a man repents of anything, he wisheth to change what he hath
done; thus where thou hearest that God repenteth, look for an actual change. God doth it
differently from thee, although He calleth it by the name of repentance; for thou dost it,
because thou hadst erred; while He doth it, because He avengeth, or freeth. He changed
Saul’s kingdom, when He repented, as it is said: and in the very passage where the Scripture
saith, “It repented Him;” it is said a little after, “for He is not a man that He should re-
pent.”5608 When therefore He changeth His works through His immutable counsel, He is
said to repent on account of this very change, not of His counsel, but of His work. But He
promised this so as not to change it. Just as this passage also saith: “The Lord sware, and
will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedec;”5609 so also since
this was promised so that it should not be changed, because it must needs happen and be
permanent; he saith, “The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David, and He shall not repent;
Of the fruit of thy body shall I set upon thy seat.” He might have said, “of the fruit of thy
loins,” wherefore did He choose to say, “Of the fruit of thy body”? Had He said that also, it
would have been true; but He chose to say with a further meaning, Ex fructu ventris, because
Christ was born of a woman without the man.
12. What then? “The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David, and He shall not shrink
from it; Of the fruit of thy body shall I set upon thy seat. If thy children will keep My covenant
and My testimonies that I shall learn them, their children also shall sit upon thy seat for
evermore” (ver. 12). If thy children keep My covenant, their children also shall sit for ever-
more. The parents establish a desert on behalf of their children. What if his children should
keep the covenant, and their children should not keep it? Why is the happiness of the children
promised in relation to their parents’ deservings? For what saith He, “If thy children will
keep My covenant, their children also shall sit for evermore”—He saith not, if thy children
keep My covenant, they shall sit upon thy seat; and if their children keep My covenant, they
also shall sit upon thy seat: but he saith, “If thy children keep My covenant, their children
also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore”—except because He here wished their fruit to be
understood by their children? “If thy children,” He saith, “will keep My covenant, and if thy
children shall keep My testimonies that I shall learn them; their children also shall sit upon
thy seat:” that is, this will be their fruit, that they sit upon thy seat. For in this life, brethren,
do all of us who labour in Christ, all of us who tremble at His words, who in any way endeav-
our to execute His will, and groan while we pray His help that we may fulfil what He com-
mandeth; do we already sit in those seats of bliss which are promised us? No: but holding
His commandments, we hope this will come to pass. This hope is spoken of under the figure
5608 1 Sam. xv. 11, 29.
5609 Ps. cx. 4.
Psalm CXXXII
of sons; because sons are the hope of man living in this life, sons are his fruit. For this reason
also men, when excusing their avarice, allege that they are reserving for their children what
they hoard up; and, unwilling to give to the destitute, excuse themselves under the name of
piety, because their children are their hope. For all men who live according to this world,
declare it to be their hope, to be fathers of children they may leave behind them. Thus then
He describes hope generally under the name of children, and saith, “If thy children will keep
My covenant and My testimonies that I shall learn them, their children also shall sit upon
thy seat for evermore:” that is, they shall have such fruits, that their hope shall not deceive
them, that they may come there where they hope to come. At present therefore they are as
fathers, men of hope for the future; but when they have attained what they hope, they are
children; because they have brought forth and produced in their works that which they gain.
And this is preserved unto them for the future,5610 because futurity5611 itself commonly
signifieth children.
13. Or if thou understand actual men to be meant by children, the words, “If thy children
will keep My covenant and My testimonies that I shall teach them,” may mean, “If thy
children will keep My covenant and testimonies that I shall teach them, and their children
also;” that is, if they too keep My covenant; so that here thou must make a slight pause, and
then infer that “they shall sit upon thy seat for evermore;” that is, both thy children and
their children, but all if they keep My covenant. What then, if they keep it not? Hath the
promise of God failed? No: but it is said and promised for this reason, that God foresaw:
what, save that they would believe? But that no man should as it were threaten God’s
promises, and prefer to place in his own power the fulfilment of what God promised: for
this reason he saith, “He made an oath:” whereby he showeth that it will without doubt take
place. How then hath He said here, “If they will keep My covenant”? Glory not in the
promises, and leave out thy failing to keep the covenant. Then wilt thou be the son of David,
if thou shalt keep the covenant; but if thou dost not keep it, thou wilt not be David’s son.
God promised to the sons of David. Say not, I am David’s son if thou degenerate. If the Jews,
who were born of this very stock, say not this (nay, they say it, but they are under a delusion.
For the Lord saith openly, “If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abra-
ham.”5612 He thereby denied them to be children, because they did not the works), how do
we call ourselves David’s children, who are not of his race according to the flesh? It follows
then that we are not children, save by imitating his faith, save by worshipping God, as he
worshipped. If therefore what thou hopest not through descent, thou wilt not endeavour to
obtain by works; how shall the sitting upon David’s seat be fulfilled in thee? And if it shall

not be fulfilled in thee, thinkest thou that it shall not be fulfilled at all? And how hath He
found it in the woodland tracts? and how did His feet stand? Whatsoever then thou mayest
be, that house will stand.
14. “For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for Himself” (ver. 13). Sion is
the Church Herself; She is also that Jerusalem unto whose peace we are running, who is in
pilgrimage not in the Angels, but in us, who in her better part waiteth for the part that will
return; whence letters have come unto us, which are every day read. This city is that very
Sion, whom the Lord hath chosen.
15. “This shall be My rest for ever” (ver. 14). These are the words of God. “My rest:” I
rest there. How greatly doth God love us, brethren, since, because we rest, He saith that He
also resteth! For He is not sometimes Himself disturbed, nor doth He rest as we do; but He
saith that He resteth there, because we shall have rest in Him. “Here will I dwell: for I have
a delight therein.”
16. “I will bless her widow with blessings, and will satisfy her poor with bread” (ver. 15).
Every soul that is aware that it is bereft of all help, save of God alone, is widowed. For how
doth the Apostle describe a widow? “She that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in
God.”5613 He was speaking of those whom we all call Widows in the Church. He saith, “She
that liveth in pleasure, is dead while she liveth;” and he numbereth her not among the widows.
But in describing true widows, what saith he? “She that is a widow indeed and desolate,
trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.” Here he addeth,
“but she that liveth in pleasure, is dead while she liveth.” What then makes a widow? That
she hath no aid from any other source, save from God alone. They that have husbands, take
pride in the protection of their husbands: widows seem desolate, and their aid is a stronger
one. The whole Church therefore is one widow, whether in men or in women, in married
men or married women, in young men or in old, or in virgins: the whole Church is one
widow, desolate in this world, if she feel this, if she is aware of her widowhood: for then is
help at hand for her. Do ye not recognise this widow in the Gospel, my brethren, when the
Lord declared “that men ought always to pray and not to faint”? “There was in a city a judge,”
He said, “which feared not God, neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city;
and she came unto him day by day, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.” The widow, by
daily importunity, prevailed with him: for the judge said within himself, “Though I fear not
God; neither regard man, yet because this woman troubleth me, I will avenge her.”5614 If
the wicked judge heard the widow, that he might not be molested; heareth not God His
Church, whom He exhorteth to pray?
5613 1 Tim. v. 5, 6.
5614 Luke xviii. 1–8.
Psalm CXXXII
17. Also, “I will satisfy her poor with bread;” what meaneth this, brethren? Let us be
poor, and we shall then be satisfied. Many who trust in the world, and are proud, are
Christians; they worship Christ, but are not satisfied; for they have been satisfied, and abound
in their pride. Of such it is said, “Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy,
and with the despitefulness of the proud:”5615 these have abundance, and therefore eat, but
are not satisfied. And what is said of them in the Psalm? “All such as be fat upon the earth
have eaten and worshipped.”5616 They worship Christ, they venerate Christ, they pray unto
Christ; but they are not satisfied with His wisdom and righteousness. Wherefore? Because
they are not poor. For the poor, that is the humble in heart, the more they hunger, the more
they eat; and the more empty they are of the world, the more hungry they are. He who is
full refuseth whatsoever thou wilt give him, because he is full. Give me one who hungereth;
give me one of whom it is said, “Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be filled:”5617 and these will be the poor of whom he hath just said, “And will
satisfy her poor with bread.” For in the very Psalm where it is said, “All such as be fat upon
the earth have eaten and worshipped;” this is said of the poor also, and exactly in the same
manner as in this Psalm, “The poor shall eat, and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord
shall praise Him.”5618 Where it is said, “All such as be fat upon earth have eaten and wor-
shipped:” it is said, “the poor shall eat, and be satisfied.” Why, when the rich are said to have
worshipped, are they not said to be satisfied; yet when the poor are mentioned, they are said
to be satisfied? And whence are they satisfied? What is the nature, brethren, of this satisfying?
God Himself is their bread. The bread came down upon the earth, that He might become
milk unto us; and said to His own, “I am the Living Bread which came down from heav-
en.”5619 Hence these words in the Psalm, “The poor shall eat, and be satisfied.” From what
source shall they be satisfied? Hear what followeth: “And they that seek after the Lord shall
praise Him.”
18. Be ye therefore poor, be ye among the members of that widow, let your help be solely
in God alone. Money is nought; not thence will ye have aid. Many have been cast headlong
down for money’s sake, many have perished on account of money; many for the sake of
their riches have been marked out by plunderers; they would have been safe, had they not
had what made men hunt for them. Many have presumed in their more powerful friends:
they in whom they presumed have fallen, and have involved in their ruin those who trusted
in them. Look back upon the instances to be seen in the human race. Is it anything singular

5617 Matt. v. 6.
5618 Ps. xxii. 29, 26.

Psalm CXXXII
that I am telling you? We speak these things not only from these Scriptures; read them in
the whole world. Take heed that ye presume not in money, in a friend, in the honour and
the boasting of the world. Take away all these things: but if thou hast them, thank God if
thou despisest them. But if thou art puffed up by them; think not when thou wilt be the prey
of men; already art thou the Devil’s prey. But if thou hast not trusted in these things, thou
wilt be among the members of that widow, who is the Church, of whom it is said, “I will
bless her widow with blessings;” thou wilt also be poor, and one of those of whom it is said,
“And will satisfy her poor with bread.”
19. Sometimes, however, and we must not pass over this without mention, thou findest
a poor man proud, and a rich man humble: we daily endure such persons. Thou hearest a
poor man groaning beneath a rich man, and when the more powerful rich man presseth
upon him, then thou seest him humble: sometimes not even then, but even then proud;
whence thou seest what he would have been, had he any property. God’s poor one is therefore
poor in spirit, not in his purse. Sometimes a man goeth forth having a full house, rich lands,
many estates, much gold and silver; he knoweth that he must not trust in these, he humbleth
himself before God, he doth good with them; thus his heart is raised unto God, so that he
is aware that not only do riches themselves profit him nothing, but that they even impede
his feet, save He rule them, and aid them: and he is counted among the poor who are satisfied
with bread. Thou findest another a proud beggar, or not proud only because he hath nothing,
nevertheless seeking whereby he may be puffed up. God doth not heed the means a man
hath, but the wish he hath, and judgeth him according to his wish for temporal blessings,
not according to the means which it is not his lot to have. Whence the Apostle saith of the
rich, “Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in
uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.” What
therefore should they do with their riches? He goeth on to say: “That they be rich in good
works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.” And see that they are poor in this world:
“Laying up in store for themselves,” he addeth, “a good foundation against the time to come,
that they may lay hold on eternal life.”5620 When they have laid hold of eternal life, then
will they be rich; but since they have it not as yet, they should know that they are poor. Thus
it is that God counteth among His poor all the humble in heart, who are established in that
twofold charity,5621 whatever they may have in this world—among His poor, whom He
satisfieth with bread.
20. “I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice and sing” (ver.
16). We are now at the end of the Psalm; attend for a short space, Beloved. “I will clothe her
priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice and sing.” Who is our salvation, save our
5620 1 Tim. vi. 17–19.
5621 Matt. xxii. 37–39.
Psalm CXXXII
Christ? What meaneth, therefore, “I will clothe her priests with salvation”? “As many of you
as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.”5622 “And her saints shall rejoice and
sing.” Whence shall they rejoice and sing? Because they have been clothed with salvation:
not in themselves. For they have become light, but in the Lord; for they were darkness be-
fore.5623 Therefore he hath added, “There will I raise up the horn of David” (ver. 17): this
will be David’s height, that trust be put in Christ. For horn signifieth height: and what sort
of height? Not carnal. Therefore, while all the bones are wrapped up in flesh, the horn goeth
beyond the flesh. Spiritual altitude is a horn. But what is spiritual loftiness, save to trust in
Christ? not to say, It is my work, I baptize;5624 but, “He it is who baptizeth.”5625 There is
the horn of David: and that ye may know that there is the horn of David, heed what followeth:
“I have ordained a lantern for mine Anointed.” What is a lantern? Ye already know the
Lord’s words concerning John: “He was a burning and a shining light.”5626 And what saith
John? “He it is who baptizeth.” Herein therefore shall the saints rejoice, herein the priests
shall rejoice: because all that is good in themselves, is not of themselves, but of Him who
hath the power of baptizing. Fearlessly therefore doth every one who hath received baptism
come unto His temple; because it is not man’s, but His who made the horn of David to
flourish.
21. “Upon Him shall My sanctification flourish” (ver. 18). Upon whom? Upon Mine
Anointed. For when He saith, “Mine anointed,” it is the voice of the Father, who saith, “I
will bless her widow with blessings, and will satisfy her poor with bread. I will clothe her
priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice and sing.” He who saith, “There will I raise
up the horn of David,” is God. He Himself saith, “I have ordained a lantern for Mine
Anointed,” because Christ is both ours and the Father’s: He is our Christ, when He saveth
us and ruleth us, as He is also our Lord: He is the Son of the Father, but both our Christ and
the Father’s. For if He were not the Father’s Christ, it would not be said above, “For Thy
servant David’s sake, turn not Thou away the presence of Thine Anointed.” “Upon Him
shall My sanctification flourish.” It flourisheth upon Christ. Let none of men assume this
to himself, that he himself sanctifieth: otherwise it will not be true, “Upon Him shall My
sanctification flourish.” The glory of sanctification shall flourish. The sanctification of Christ
therefore in Christ Himself, is the power of the sanctification of God in Christ. In that he
saith, “shall flourish,” he refers to His glory: for when trees flourish, then are they beautiful.
Sanctification therefore is in Baptism: thence it flourisheth, and is brightened. Why hath

the world yielded to this beauty? Because it flourisheth in Christ; for, put it in man’s power,
and how doth it then flourish? since “all flesh in grass, and all the goodliness thereof as the
flower of the grass.”
Psalm CXXXII
Psalm CXXXIII.5627
1. This is a short Psalm, but one well known and quoted. “Behold, how good and how
pleasant is it, that brethren should dwell together in unity” (ver. 1). So sweet is that sound,
that even they who know not the Psalter, sing that verse. …
2. For these same words of the Psalter, this sweet sound, that honeyed melody, as well
of the mind as of the hymn, did even beget the Monasteries. By this sound were stirred up
the brethren who longed to dwell together. This verse was their trumpet. It sounded through
the whole earth, and they who had been divided, were gathered together. The summons of
God, the summons of the Holy Spirit, the summons of the Prophets, were not heard in
Judah, yet were heard through the whole world. They were deaf to that sound, amid whom
it was sung; they were found with their ears open, of whom it was said, “They shall see him,
who were not told of him; they shall understand who heard not.”5628 Yet, most beloved, if
we reflect, the very blessing hath sprung from that wall5629 of circumcision. For have all the
Jews perished? and whence were the Apostles, the sons of the Prophets, the sons of the ex-
iles?5630 He speaks as to them who know. Whence those five hundred, who saw the Lord
after His resurrection, whom the Apostle Paul commemorates?5631 Whence those hundred
and twenty,5632 who were together in one place after the resurrection of the Lord, and His
ascension into heaven, on whom when gathered into one place the Holy Spirit descended
on the day of Pentecost, sent down from heaven, sent, even as He was promised?5633 All
were from thence, and they first dwelt together in unity; who sold all they had, and laid the
price of their goods at the Apostles’ feet, as is read in the Acts of the Apostles.5634 And dis-
tribution was made to each one as he had need,5635 and none called anything his own, but
they had all things common. And what is “together in unity”? They had, he says, one mind
and one heart God-wards.5636 So they were the first who heard, Behold how good and how

pleasant is it, that brethren dwell together. They were the first to hear, but heard it not
alone.…
3. From the words of this Psalm was taken the name of Monks, that no one may reproach
you who are Catholics by reason of the name. When you with justice reproach heretics by
reason of the Circelliones,5637 that they may be saved by shame, they reproach you on the
score of the Monks.…
4. Moreover, beloved, there are they who are false Monks, and we know men of this
kind; but the pious brotherhood is not annulled, because of them who profess to be what
they are not. There are false Monks, as there are false men among the Clergy, and among
the faithful.5638…
5. Since the Psalm says, “Behold, how good and how pleasant is it, that brethren should
dwell together in one,” why then should we not call Monks so? for Monos5639 is one. Not
one in any manner, for a man in a crowd is one, but though he can be called one along with
others, he cannot be Monos, that is, alone, for Monos means “one alone.” They then who
thus live together as to make one man, so that they really possess what is written, “one mind
and one heart,”5640 many bodies, but not many minds; many bodies, but not many hearts;
can rightly be called Monos, that is, one alone.5641…
6. Let the Psalm tell us what they are like. “As the ointment on the head, which descended
to the beard, to Aaron’s beard, which descended to the fringe of his garment” (ver. 2). What
was Aaron? A priest. Who is a priest, except that one Priest, who entered into the Holy of
Holies? Who is that priest, save Him, who was at once Victim and Priest? save Him who

robbing and beating whom they would, sending threatening notices, etc., and sometimes seeking death, or even

Psalm CXXXIII
when he found nothing clean in the world to offer, offered Himself? The ointment is on his
head, because Christ is one whole with the Church, but the ointment comes from the head.
Our Head is Christ crucified and buried; He rose again, and ascended into heaven; and the
Holy Spirit came from the head. Whither? To the beard. The beard signifies the courageous;
the beard distinguishes the grown men, the earnest, the active, the vigorous. So that when
we describe such, we say, he is a bearded man. Thus that ointment descended first upon the
Apostles, descended upon those who bore the first assaults of the world, and therefore the
Holy Spirit descended on them. For they who first began to dwell together in unity, suffered
persecution, but because the ointment descended to the beard, they suffered, but were not
conquered.…
7. “As the dew of Hermon, which fell upon the hills of Sion” (ver. 3). He would have it
understood, my brethren, that it is of God’s grace that brethren dwell together in unity.…
8. But ye should know what Hermon is. It is a mountain far distant from Jerusalem,
that is, from Sion. And so it is strange that he says thus: As the dew of Hermon, which fell
upon the mountains of Sion, since mount Hermon is far distant from Jerusalem, for it is
said to be over Jordan. Let us then seek out some interpretation of Hermon. The word is
Hebrew, and we learn its meaning from them who know that language. Hermon is said to
mean, a light set on a high place. For from Christ comes the dew. No light is set on a high
place, save Christ. How is He set on high? First on the cross, afterwards in heaven. Set on
high on the cross when He was humbled; humbled, but His humiliation could not but be
high. The ministry of man grew less and less, as was signified in John; the ministry of God
in our Lord Jesus Christ increased, as was shown at their birth. The former was born, as the
tradition of the Church shows, on the 24th of June, when the days begin to shorten. The
Lord was born on the 25th of December, when the days begin to lengthen. Here John himself
confessing, “He must increase, but I must decrease.”5642 And the passion of each shows
this. The Lord was exalted on the cross; John was diminished by beheading. Thus the light
set on high is Christ, whence is the dew of Hermon.…But if he have the dew of Hermon,
which fell on the hill of Sion, he is quiet, peaceable, humble, submissive, pouring forth
prayer in place of murmuring. For murmurers are admirably described in a certain passage
of the Scriptures, “The heart of a fool is as the wheel of a cart.” 5643 What is the meaning of
“the heart of a fool is as the wheel of a cart”? It carries hay, and creaks. The wheel of a cart
cannot cease from creaking. Thus there are many brethren, who do not dwell together, save
in the body. But who are they who dwell together? They of whom it is said, “And they had
one mind and one heart towards God.”5644

Psalm CXXXIII
9. “Because there the Lord commanded blessing.” Where did He command it? Among
the brethren who dwell together. There He enjoined blessing, there they who dwell with
one heart bless God. For thou blessest not God in division of heart.…Art thou straitened
on earth? Depart, have thy habitation in heaven. How shall I, a man clothed in flesh, enslaved
to the flesh, thou wilt say, have my habitation in heaven. First go in heart, whither thou
wouldest follow in the body. Do not hear, “Lift up your hearts,” with a deaf ear. Keep thy
heart lifted up, and no one will straiten thee in heaven.
Psalm CXXXIII
Psalm CXXXIV.5645
1. “Behold, now, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord” (ver. 1), “who stand in
the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God” (ver. 2). Why has he added,
“in the courts”? Courts mean the wider spaces of a house. He who stands in the courts is
not straitened, is not confined, in some fashion is enlarged. Remain in this enlargement,
and thou canst love thy enemy, because thou lovest not things in which an enemy could
straiten thee. How canst thou be understood to stand in the courts? Stand in charity, and
thou standest in the courts. Breadth lies in charity, straitness in hatred.
2. “Lift up your hands by night in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord” (ver. 2). It is easy
to bless by day. What is “by day”? In prosperity. For night is a sad thing, day a cheerful.
When it is well with thee, thou dost bless the Lord. Thy son was sick, and he is made whole,
thou dost bless the Lord. Thy son was sick, perchance thou hast sought an astrologer, a
soothsayer, perchance a curse against the Lord has come, not from thy tongue, but from
thy deeds, from thy deeds and thy life. Boast not, because thou blessest with thy tongue, if
thou cursest with thy life. Wherefore bless ye the Lord. When? By night. When did Job bless?
When it was a sad night. All was taken away which he possessed; the children for whom his
goods were stored were taken away. How sad was his night! Let us however see whether he
blesseth not in the night. “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; it is as the Lord willed;
blessed be the name of the Lord.”5646 And black was the night.…
3. “The Lord out of Zion bless thee, who made heaven and earth” (ver. 3). He exhorts
many to bless, and Himself blesseth one, because He maketh one out of many, since “it is
good and pleasant for brethren to dwell together in one.”5647 It is a plural number, brethren,
and yet singular, to dwell together in one. Let none of you say, It cometh not to me. Knowest
thou of whom he speaks, “the Lord bless thee out of Zion.” He blessed one. Be one,5648 and
the blessing cometh to thee.

Psalm CXXXV.5649
1. Very pleasant ought it be to us, and we should rejoice because it is pleasant, to which
this Psalm exhorteth us. For it says, “Praise the name of the Lord” (ver. 1). And it forthwith
appends the reason, why it is just to praise the name of the Lord. “Praise the Lord, ye ser-
vants.” What more just? what more worthy? what more thankful?…For if He teaches His
own servants who have deserved well of Him, the preachers of His Word, the rulers of His
Church, the worshippers of His name, the obeyers of His command, that in their own con-
science they should possess the sweetness of their life, lest they be corrupted by the praise
or disheartened by the reproach of men; how much the more is He above all, the unchange-
able One, who teacheth these things, neither the greater if thou praisest, or the less if thou
reproachest.…For ye will do nothing out of place, by praising your Lord, as servants. And
if ye were to be for ever only servants, ye ought to praise the Lord; how much more ought
ye servants to praise the Lord, that ye may hereafter gain the privilege of sons?
2. …Therefore, “Ye who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of
our God, praise the Lord” (ver. 2). Be thankful; ye were without, and ye stand within. Since
then ye stand, is it a small thing for you to think where He should be praised, who raised
you when you were cast down, and caused you to stand in His house, to know Him, and to
praise Him? Is it a small boon, that we stand in the house of the Lord?…If one thinks of
this, and is not unthankful, he will utterly despise himself in comparison with the love of
his Lord, who hath done so great things for him. And since he hath nothing wherewith to
repay God for so great benefits, what remains for him but to give Him thanks, not to repay
Him? It belongs to the very act of thanksgiving, to “receive the cup of the Lord, and to call
upon His name.”5650 For what can the servant repay the Lord for all that He hath given
him?5651
3. What reason shall I give why you should praise Him? “Because the Lord is good” (ver.
3). Briefly in one word is here explained the praise of the Lord our God. “The Lord is good;”
good, not in the same manner as the things which He here made are good. For God made
all things very good;5652 not only good, but also very good. He made the sky and earth, and
all things which are in them good, and He made them very good. If He made all these things
good, of what sort is He who made them?…
4. How far can we speak of His goodness? Who can conceive in his heart, or apprehend
how good the Lord is? Let us however return to ourselves, and in us recognise Him, and

praise the Maker in His works, because we are not fit to contemplate Him Himself. And in
hope that we may be able to contemplate Him, when our heart hath been purified by faith,
that hereafter it may rejoice in the Truth; now as He cannot be seen by us, let us look at His
works, that we may not live without praising Him. So I5653 have said, “Praise the Lord, for
He is good; sing praises unto His Name, for He is sweet”.…He is Mediator, and thereupon
is sweet. What is sweeter than angels’ food? How can God not be sweet, since man ate angels’
food? For men and angels live not on different meat. That is truth, that is wisdom, that is
the goodness of God, but thou canst not enjoy it in like wise with the angels.…That man
might eat angels’ food, the Creator of the angels was made man. 5654 If ye taste, sing praises;
if ye have tasted how sweet the Lord is, sing praises; if that which ye have tasted has a good
savour, praise it; who is so unthankful to cook or purveyor, as not to return thanks by
praising what he tastes, if he be pleased by any food. If we are not silent on such occasions,
shall we be silent concerning Him, who has given us all things?…
5. “For the Lord hath chosen Jacob to Himself, Israel for His own possession” (ver.
4).…Let not Jacob therefore extol himself, let him not boast himself, or ascribe it to his own
merits. He was known before, predestinated before, elected before, not elected for his own
merits, but found out, and gifted with life by the grace of God. So with all the Gentiles; for
how did the wild-olive deserve, that it should be grafted in, from the bitterness of its berries,
the barrenness of its wildness? It was the wood of the wilderness, not of the Lord’s field, and
yet He of His mercy grafted the wild-olive into the (true) olive. But up to this time the wild-
olive was not grafted in.
6. …“Because,” says he, “I know that the Lord is great, and our God is above all gods”
(ver. 5). If we should say to him, we ask thee, explain to us His greatness; would he not
perchance answer us, He whom I see is not so very great, if He be able to be expounded by
me. Let him then return to His works, and tell us. Let him hold in his conscience the greatness
of God, which he has seen, which he has committed to our faith, whither he could not lead
our eyes, and enumerate some of the things which the Lord hath done here; that unto us,
who cannot see His greatness as he can, He may become sweet through the works of His
which we can comprehend.…
7. “All whatsoever the Lord willed, He made in the heaven, and in the earth, in the sea,
and in all its deep places” (ver. 6). Who can comprehend these things? Who can enumerate
the works of the Lord in the heaven and earth, in the sea, and in all deep places? Yet if we
cannot comprehend them all, we should believe and hold them without question, because
whatever creature is in heaven, whatever is in earth, whatever is in the sea and in all deep
places, has been made by the Lord.…

5654 Ps. lxxviii. 25.
Psalm CXXXV
8. “Raising the clouds from the ends of the earth” (ver. 7). We see these works of God
in His creation. For the clouds come from the ends of the earth to the midst thereof, and
rain; thou scannest not whence they arise. Hence the prophet signifies this, from “the ends
of the earth,” whether it be from the bottom, or from the circumference of the ends of the
earth, whencesoever He wills He raises the clouds, only from the earth. “He hath made
lightnings into rain.” For lightnings without rain would frighten thee, and bestow nothing
on thee. “He maketh lightnings unto rain.” It lightens, and thou tremblest; it rains, thou
rejoicest. “He hath made lightnings unto rain.” He who terrified thee, Himself causest that
thou shouldest rejoice. “Who bringeth the winds out of His treasures,” their causes are
hidden, thou knowest not whence they come. When the wind blows, thou feelest it; why it
blows, or from what treasure of His wisdom it is brought forth, thou knowest not; 5655 yet
thou owest to God the worship of faith, for it would not blow unless He had bidden who
made it, unless He had brought it forth who created it.
9. We see therefore these things in that work of His; we praise, we marvel at, we bless
God; let us see what He has done among men for His people. “Who smote the first-born of
Egypt” (ver. 8). But withal those divine doings are told which thou mightest love, those are
not told which thou mightest fear. Attend, and see that also when He is angry, He doeth
what He willeth. “From man even unto beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of
thee, O Egypt!” (ver. 9). Ye know, ye have read what the hand of the Lord did by Moses in
Egypt, to crush and cast down the proud Egyptians, “on Pharaoh and on all his servants.”
Little did He in Egypt: what did He after His people was led out thence? “Who smote many
nations” (ver. 10), who possessed that land, which God willed to give His people. “And slew
mighty kings, Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms
of Canaan” (ver. 11). All these things which the Psalm records simply, do we read likewise
in others of the Lord’s books, and there the hand of the Lord is great. When thou seest what
has been done to the wicked, take heed lest it be done to thee.…But when the good man
sees what the wicked has suffered, let him cleanse himself from all iniquity, lest he fall into
a like punishment, a like chastisement. Then ye have thoroughly understood these things.
What did God then? He drove out the wicked, “And he gave their land for an inheritance,
even an inheritance to Israel His servant” (ver. 12).
10. Then follows the loud cry of His praise. “Thy Name, O Lord, is for ever and ever”
(ver. 13), after all these things which Thou hast done. For what do I see that Thou hast done?
I behold Thy creation which Thou hast made in heaven, I behold this lower part, where we
dwell, and here I see Thy gifts of clouds, and winds, and rain. I regard Thy people; Thou
leddest them from the house of bondage, and didst signs and wonders upon their enemies.
Thou punishedst those who caused them trouble, Thou dravest the wicked from their land,
5655 John iii. 8.
Psalm CXXXV
Thou killedst their kings, Thou gavest their land to Thy people: I have seen all these things,
and filled with joy have said, “Lord, Thy Name is for ever and ever.”…
11. All these things then did God overthrow, in the body at that time, when our fathers
were led out of the land of Egypt, in the spirit now. Nor does His Hand cease until the end.
Therefore deem not that these mighty deeds of God were then finished and have ceased.
“Thy Name, O Lord,” he says, “is for ever.”5656 That is, Thy loving-kindness ceaseth not,
Thy hand ceaseth not for ever from doing these things, which then Thou didst afore declare
in a figure. “But they are written for our admonition, on whom the end of the ages is
come.”5657 One generation and another generation; the generation by which we are made
the faithful, and are born again by baptism; the generation by which we shall rise again from
the dead, and shall live with the Angels for ever. Thy Memorial, O Lord, is above this gener-
ation, and above that; for neither doth He now forget to call us, nor then will He forget to
crown us.
12. “The Lord hath judged His people, and will be called upon among His servants”
(ver. 14). Already hath He judged the people. Save the final judgment, the people of the Jews
is judged. What is “judged”? The just are taken away, the unjust are left. But if I lie, or am
thought to lie, because I have said, it is already judged, hear the Lord saying, “I have come
for judgment into this world, that they who see not may see, and they who see may be made
blind.”5658 The proud are made blind, the lowly are enlightened. Therefore, “He hath judged
His people.” Isaiah spake the judgment. “And now, thou house of Jacob, come ye, let us
walk in the light of the Lord.”5659 This is a small matter; but what follows? “For He hath
put away His people, the house of Israel.” The house of Jacob is the house of Israel; for he
who is Jacob, the same is Israel.…Therefore God had judged His people, by separating the
evil and the good; that is to say, “He shall be called upon among His servants.” By whom?
By the Gentiles. For how vast are the nations who have come in by faith. How many farms
and desert places now come in to us? They come thence no one can tell how numerously;
they would believe. We say to them, What will ye? They answer, To know the glory of God.
Believe, my brethren, that we wonder and rejoice at such a claim of these rustic people. They
come I know not whither, roused up by I know not whom. How shall I say, I know not by
whom? I know indeed by whom, because He says, “No one cometh to Me, save whom the
Father draweth.”5660 They come suddenly from the woods, the desert, the most distant and
lofty mountains, to the Church; and many of them, nay, near all hold this language, so that

Psalm CXXXV
we see of a truth that God teacheth them within.5661 The prophecy of Scripture is fulfilled,
when it says, “And they shall all be taught of God.”5662 We say to them, What do ye long
for? And they answer, To see the glory of God.5663 “For all have sinned, and come short of
the glory of God.”5664 They believe, they are sanctified, they will to have clergy ordained
for them. Is it not fulfilled, “and He will be called upon among His servants”?
13. Lastly, after all that arrangement and dispensation, the Spirit of God turns itself to
reproaching and ridiculing those idols, which are now ridiculed by their very worshippers.
“The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold” (ver. 15). As God made all these things, who
made whatever He would in heaven and earth, what can anything that man maketh be, but
an object of ridicule, not adoration? Was He perchance about to speak of “the idols of the
Gentiles,” that we might despise them all? was He about to speak of the idols of the heathen,
stones and wood, plaster and pottery? I say not these, they are mean materials. I speak of
that which they specially love, that which they specially honour. “The idols of the Gentiles
are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.” Surely it is gold, surely it is silver: because
silver glitters, and gold glitters, have they therefore eyes, or do they see?…But as these things
are senseless, why make ye men of silver and gold to be gods? See ye not that the gods which
ye make see not? “They have a mouth, and will not speak; they have eyes, and will not see”
(ver. 16); “they have ears, and will not hear; neither is there any breath in their mouth” (ver.
17); “they have nostrils, and will not smell; they have hands, and will not work; they have
feet, and will not walk.” All these things could the carpenter, the silversmith, the goldsmith
make, both eyes, and ears, and nostrils, and mouth, and hands, and feet, but he could give
neither sight to the eyes, nor hearing to the ears, nor speech to the mouth, nor smell to the
nostrils, nor motion to the hands, or going to the feet.
14. And man, thou laughest doubtless at what thou hast made, if thou knowest by whom
thou art made. But of them who know not, what is said? “All they who make them, and all
they who trust in them, are like them” (ver. 18). And ye believe, brethren, that there is a
likeness to these idols expressed not in their flesh, but in their inner man. For “they have
ears, and hear not.” God calls to them indeed, “He who hath ears to hear, let him hear.”5665
They have eyes, and see not, for they have the eyes of the body, and not the eyes of faith.
Lastly, this prophecy is fulfilled among all the nations.…Is it not fulfilled? Is it not seen, as
it is written? And they who remain have eyes, and see not; have nostrils, and smell not. They
perceive not that savour. “We are a good savour of Christ,”5666 as the apostle says everywhere.

Psalm CXXXV
What profiteth it, that they have nostrils, and smell not that so sweet savour of Christ? Truly
it is done in them, and truly it is said of them, “All they who make them,” etc.
15. But daily do men believe through the miracles of Christ our Lord; daily the eyes of
the blind, the ears of the deaf are opened, the nostrils of the senseless are breathed into, the
tongues of the dumb are loosed, the hands of the palsied are strengthened, the feet of the
lame are guided; sons of Abraham are raised up of these stones,5667 to all of whom be it
said, “Bless the Lord, ye house of Israel” (ver. 19). All are sons of Abraham; and if sons of
Abraham are raised up from these stones, it is plain that they are rather the house of Israel
who belong to the house of Israel, the seed of Abraham, not by the flesh, but by faith. But
even granting that it is said of that house, and the people of Israel is meant, from thence did
the Apostles and thousands of the circumcised believe? “Bless the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Bless the Lord, ye house of Levi” (ver. 20). Bless the Lord, ye nations, this is, the “house of
Israel” generally; bless Him, ye leaders, this is, the “house of Aaron;” bless Him, ye servants,
this is, the “house of Levi.” What of the other nations? “Ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.”
16. Let us also with one voice say what follows: “Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, who
dwelleth in Jerusalem” (ver. 21). Out of Zion is Jerusalem too. Zion is “watching,” Jerusalem
the “vision of peace.” In what Jerusalem will He dwell now? In that which has fallen? Nay,
but in that which is our mother, which is in the heavens, of which it is said, “The desolate
hath more children than she which hath a husband.”5668 For now the Lord is from Zion,
because we watch when He will come; now as long as we live in hope, we are in Zion. When
our way is ended, we shall dwell in that city which will never fall, because the Lord dwelleth
in her, and keepeth her, which is the vision of peace, the eternal Jerusalem; for the praise of
which, my brethren, language sufficeth not; where we shall find no enemy, either within
the Church or without the Church, neither in our flesh, nor in our thoughts. For “death
shall be swallowed up in victory,”5669 and we shall be free to see God in eternal peace, being
made citizens of Jerusalem, the city of God.

Psalm CXXXV
Psalm CXXXVI.5670
1. “Give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever” (ver.
1). This Psalm contains the praise of God, and all its verses finish in the same way. Wherefore
although many things are related here in praise of God, yet His mercy is most commen-
ded;5671 for without this plain commendation, he, whom the Holy Spirit used to utter this
Psalm, would have no verse be ended. Although after the judgment, by which at the end of
the world the quick and the dead must be judged, the just being sent into life eternal, the
unjust into everlasting fire,5672 there will not afterwards be those, whom God will have
mercy on, yet rightly may His future mercy be understood to be for ever, which He bestows
on His saints and faithful ones, not because they will be miserable for ever, and therefore
will need His mercy for ever, but because that very blessedness, which He mercifully bestows
on the miserable, that they cease to be miserable, and begin to be happy, will have no end,
and therefore “His mercy is for ever.” For that we shall be just from being unjust, whole
from being unsound, alive from being dead, immortal from being mortal, happy from being
wretched, is of His mercy. But this that we shall be, will be for ever, and therefore “His mercy
is for ever.” Wherefore, “give thanks to the Lord;” that is, praise the Lord by giving thanks,
“for He is good:” nor is it any temporal good you will gain from this confession, for, “His
mercy endureth for ever;” that is, the benefit which He bestows mercifully upon you, is for
ever.5673
2. Then follows, “Give thanks to the God of gods, for His mercy endureth for ever” (ver.
2). “Give thanks to the Lord of lords, for His mercy endureth for ever” (ver. 3). We may well
enquire, Who are these gods and lords, of whom He who is the true God is God and Lord?
And we find written in another Psalm, that even men are called gods.5674 The Lord even
takes note of this testimony in the Gospel, saying, “Is it not written in your Law, I have said,
Ye are gods?”5675…It is not therefore because they are all good, but because “the word of
5670 Lat. CXXXV.
5671 [He says: “I remember, in the hundred and sixth Psalm, which begins in the same way, because the
manuscript which I read had not ‘for ever,’ but, ‘for ages’ (in sæculum), ‘His mercy,’ that I enquired what we
had better understand. For, in the Greek language, it is written, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, which may be interpreted, ‘for
ages’ and (in æternum) ‘for ever.’ But it would be tedious to renew the enquiries I made as best I could in that
place. But in this Psalm the same manuscript has not ‘for ages,’ which most have, but, ‘for ever His mercy.’”—C.]
5672 Matt. xxv. 46.
5673 [He adds: “The expression, ‘for He is good,’ in the Greek is ‡γαθος; not as in the hundred and sixth
Psalm, for there “He is good,’ in Greek is χρηστός. And so some have expounded the former, ‘Since He is sweet.’
For ‡γαθος is not good anyhow, but good most excellently.”—C.]

Psalm CXXXVI
Psalm CXXXVI
God came to them,” that they were called gods. For were it because they are all good, He
would not thus distinguish between them. He saith, “He judgeth between the gods.” Then
follows, “How long do ye judge iniquity!”5676 and the rest, which He says certainly not to
all, but to some, because He saith it in distinguishing, and yet He distinguisheth between
the gods.
3. But it is asked, If men are called gods to whom the word of the Lord came, are the
Angels to be called gods, when the greatest reward which is promised to just and holy men
is the being equal to Angels? In the Scriptures I know not whether it can, at least easily, be
found, that the Angels are openly called gods; but when it had been said of the Lord God,
“He is terrible, above all gods,” he adds, as by way of exposition why he says this, “for the
gods of the heathen are devils,”5677 that we might understand what had been expressed in
the Hebrew, “the gods of the Gentiles are idols,” meaning rather the devils which dwell in
the idols.5678 For as regards images, which in Greek are called idols, a name we now use in
Latin, they have eyes and see not, and all the other things which are said of them, because
they are utterly without sense; wherefore they cannot be frightened, for nothing which has
no sense can be frightened. How then can it be said of the Lord, “He is terrible above all
gods, because the gods of the Gentiles are idols,” if the devils which may be terrified are not
understood to be in these images. Whence also the Apostle says, “We know that an idol is
nothing.”5679 This refers to its earthy senseless material. But that no one may think, that
there is no living and sentient nature, which delights in the Gentile sacrifices, he adds, “But
what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: I would not have you
partaken with devils.”5680 If therefore we never find in the divine words that the holy Angels
are called gods, I think the best reason is, that men may not be induced by the name to pay
that ministry and service of religion (which in Greek is called λειτουργία or λατρία) to the
holy Angels, which neither would they have paid by man at all, save to that God, who is the
God of themselves and men. 5681 Hence they are much more correctly called Angels, which
in Latin is Nuntii, that by the name of their function, not their substance, we may plainly
understand that they would have us worship the God, whom they announce. The whole
then of that question the Apostle has briefly expounded, when he says, “For though there

5681 [The Roman dogma makes a verbal distinction as to worship of angels and saints, to meet the case as
our author puts it here. But the vulgar cannot so distinguish; and everywhere, practically, this latria is offered.

Psalm CXXXVI
be who are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there are gods many and lords
many; yet we have one God the Father, from whom are all, and we in Him; and one Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him.”5682
4. Let us therefore “give thanks to the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, for His mercy,”
etc. “Who alone did wonderful things” (ver. 4). As at the last part of every verse, it is written,
“For His mercy endureth for ever,” so we must understand at the beginning of each, though
it be not written, “Give thanks.” Which indeed in the Greek is very plain. It would be so in
Latin, if our translators had been able to make use of that expression. Which indeed they
could have done in this verse, if they had said, “To Him who doeth5683 wonderful things.”
For where we have, “who did wonderful things,” the Greek has τῷ ποιήσαντι, where we
must necessarily understand, “give thanks.” And I would they had added the pronoun, and
said to Him, “who did,” or to Him “who doeth,” or to Him “who made sure;” because then
one might easily understand, “let us give thanks.” For now it is so obscurely rendered, that
he who either knows not or cares not to examine a Greek manuscript may think, “who made
the heavens, who made sure the earth, who made the luminaries, for His mercy endureth
for ever,”5684 has been so said, because He did these things for this reason, “because His
mercy endureth for ever:” whereas they, whom He has freed from misery, belong to His
Mercy: but not that we should believe that He makes sky, earth, and luminaries, of His
Mercy; since they are marks of His Goodness, who created all things very good.5685 For He
created all things, that they might have their being;5686 but it is the work of His Mercy, to
cleanse us from our sins, and deliver us from everlasting misery. And so the Psalm thus
addresses us, “Give thanks unto the God of gods, give thanks unto the Lord of lords.” Give
thanks to Him, “who alone doeth great wonders;” give thanks to Him, “who by His wisdom
made the heavens;” give thanks to Him, “who stretched out the earth above the waters;”
give thanks to Him, “who alone made great lights.” But why we are to praise, he setteth
down at the end of all the verses, “for His mercy endureth for ever.”
5. But what meaneth, “who alone doeth great wonders”? Is it because many wonderful
things He hath done by means of angels and men? Some wonderful things there are which
God doeth alone, and these he enumerates, saying, “who by His wisdom made the heavens”
(ver. 5), “who stretched out the earth above the waters” (ver. 6), “who alone made great
lights” (ver. 7). For this reason did he add “alone” in this verse also, because the other
wonders which he is about to tell of, God did by means of man. For having said, “who alone

made great lights,” he goes on to explain what these are, “the sun to rule the day” (ver. 8),
“the moon and stars to govern the night” (ver. 9); then he begins to tell the wonders which
He did by means of angels and men: “who smote Egypt with their first-born” (ver. 10), and
the rest. The whole creation then God manifestly made, not by means of any creature, but
“alone;” and of this creation he hath mentioned certain more eminent parts, that they might
make us think on the whole; the heavens we can understand,5687 and the earth we see. And
as there are visible heavens too, by mentioning the lights in them, he has bid us look on the
whole body of the heavens as made by Him.
6. However, whether by what he saith, “who made the heavens in understanding,” or,
as others have rendered it, “in intelligence,” he meant to signify, the heavens we can under-
stand, or that He in His understanding or intelligence, that is, in His wisdom made the
heavens (as it is elsewhere written, “in wisdom hast Thou made them all”5688), implying
thereby the only-begotten Word, may be a question. But if it be so, that we are to understand
that “God by His wisdom made the heavens,” why saith He this only of the heavens,
whereas God made all things by the same wisdom? It is that it needed only to be expressed
there, so that in the rest it might be understood without being written. How then could it
be “alone,” if “in understanding” or “in intelligence” means “by His wisdom,” that is, by the
only-begotten Word? Is it that, inasmuch as the Trinity is not three Gods, but one God, he
states that God made these things alone, because He made not creation by means of any
creature?
7. But what is, “who laid out the earth above the waters”? For it is a difficult question,
because the earth seemeth to be the heavier, so that it should be believed not so much to be
borne on the waters, as to bear the waters. And that we may not seem contentiously to
maintain our Scriptures against those who think that they have discovered these matters on
sure principles, we have a second interpretation to give, that the earth which is inhabited
by men, and contains the living creatures of the earth, is “laid out above the waters” because
it stands out above the waters which surround it. For when we speak of a city on the sea
being built “above the waters,” it is not meant that the sea is under it in the same way as the
waters are under the chambers of caverns, or under ships sailing over them; but it is said to
be “above” the sea, because it stands up above the sea below it.
8. But if these words further signify something else which more closely concerns us,
God “by His wisdom made the heavens,” that is, His saints, spiritual men, to whom He has
given not only to believe, but also to understand things divine; those who cannot yet attain
to this, and only hold their faith firmly, as being beneath the heavens, are figured by the
name of earth. And because they abide with unshaken belief upon the baptism they have
5687 Intelligibiles cœlos.
5688 Ps. civ. 24.
Psalm CXXXVI
received, therefore it is said, “He laid out the earth above the waters.” Further, since it is
written of our Lord Jesus Christ, that “in Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge,”5689 and that these two, wisdom and knowledge, differ somewhat from one
another is testified by other utterances of Scripture, especially in the words of holy Job,5690
where both are in a manner defined; not unsuitably then do we understand wisdom to
consist in the knowledge and love of That which ever is and abideth unchangeable, which
is God. For where he saith, “piety5691 is wisdom,” in Greek is θεοσ™βεια, and to express
the whole of this in Latin, we may call it worship of God.5692 But to depart from evil, which
he calls knowledge, what else is it but to walk cautiously and heedfully “in the midst of a
crooked and perverse generation,”5693 in the night, as it were, of this world, that each one
by keeping himself from iniquity may avoid being confounded with the darkness, distin-
guished by the light of his proper gift.…
9. “Who brought out Israel from the midst of them” (ver. 11). He brought out also His
saints and faithful ones from the midst of the wicked. “With a mighty Hand and stretched-
out Arm” (ver. 12). What more powerful, what more out-stretched, than that of which is
said “To whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?”5694 “Who divided the Red Sea in two
parts” (ver. 13). He divided also in such wise, that the same baptism should be to some unto
life, to others unto death. “And brought out Israel through the midst of it” (ver. 14). So too
He brings out His renewed people through the laver of regeneration. “And overthrew
Pharaoh and his power in the Red Sea” (ver. 15). He quickly destroyeth both the sin of His
people and the guilt thereof by baptism. “Who led His people through the wilderness” (ver.
16). Us too He leadeth through the drought and barrenness of this world, that we perish
not therein. “Who smote great kings” (ver. 17), “and slew famous kings” (ver. 18). From us
too He smites and slays the deadly powers of the devil. “Sehon king of the Amorites” (ver.
19), an “useless shoot,” or “fiery temptation,” for so is Sehon interpreted: the king of “them
who cause bitterness,” for such is the meaning of Amorites. “And Og, the king of Basan”
(ver. 20). The “heaper-together,” such is the meaning of Og, and, king of “confusion,” which
Basan signifies. For what else doth the devil heap together but confusion? “And gave away
their land for an heritage” (ver. 21), “even an heritage unto Israel His servant” (ver. 22). For
He giveth them, whom once the devil owned, for an heritage to the seed of Abraham, that
is, Christ. “Who remembered us in our low estate” (ver. 23), “and redeemed us from our

enemies” (ver. 24) by the Blood of His only-begotten Son. “Who giveth food to all flesh”
(ver. 25), that is, to the whole race of mankind, not Israelites only, but Gentiles too; and of
this Food is said, “My Flesh is meat indeed.” “Give thanks unto the God of Heaven” (ver.
26). “Give thanks unto the Lord of lords” (ver. 27). For what he here says, “the God of
Heaven,” I suppose that he meant to express in other words what He had before said, “the
God of gods.” For what there he subjoined, he has here also repeated. “Give thanks unto
the Lord of lords.” “But to us there is but one God,” etc., “and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom are all things, and we by Him;”5695 to whom we confess that “His mercy endureth
for ever.”
5695 1 Cor. viii. 5, 6.
Psalm CXXXVI
Psalm CXXXVII.5696
1. …But to-day we have sung, “By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, when
we remembered Sion” (ver. 1).…
2. Observe “the waters of Babylon.” “The waters of Babylon” are all things which here
are loved, and pass away. One man, for example, loveth to practise husbandry, to grow rich
thereby, to employ his mind therein, thence to gain pleasure: let him observe the issue, and
see that what he hath loved is not a foundation of Jerusalem, but a stream of Babylon. An-
other saith, It is a grand thing to be a soldier: all husbandmen fear those who are soldiers.…
3. But then other citizens of the holy Jerusalem, understanding their captivity, mark
how the natural wishes and the various lusts of men hurry and drag them hither and thither,
and drive them into the sea; they see this, and they throw not themselves into the waters of
Babylon, but “sit down and weep,” either for those who are being carried away by them, or
themselves whose deserts have placed them in Babylon, but sitting, that is, humbling
themselves. O holy Sion, where all stands firm and nothing flows! Who hath thrown us
headlong into this? Why have we left thy Founder and thy society? Behold, placed where
all things are flowing and gliding away, scarce one, if he can grasp the tree, shall be snatched
from the stream and escape. Humbling ourselves then in our captivity, let us “sit by the
waters of Babylon,” let us not dare to plunge ourselves in those streams, nor to be proud
and lifted up in the evil and sadness of our captivity, but let us sit, and so weep. Let us sit
“by” the waters, not beneath the waters, of Babylon; such be our humility, that it overwhelm
us not. Sit “by” the waters, not “in” the waters, not “under” the waters; but yet sit, in humble
fashion, talk not as thou wouldest in Jerusalem.…
4. For many weep with the weeping of Babylon, because they rejoice also with the joy
of Babylon. When men rejoice at gains and weep at losses, both are of Babylon. Thou
oughtest to weep, but in the remembrance of Sion. If thou weepest in the remembrance of
Sion, thou oughtest to weep even when it is well with thee in Babylon.…
5. “On the willows in the midst thereof we hung up our instruments of music” (ver. 2).
The citizens of Jerusalem have their “instruments of music,” God’s Scriptures, God’s com-
mands, God’s promises, meditation on the life to come; but while they are dwelling “in
Babylon,” they “hang up their instruments.” Willows are unfruitful trees, and here so placed,
that no good whatever can be understood of them: elsewhere perhaps there may. Here un-
derstand barren trees, growing by the waters of Babylon. These trees are watered by the
waters of Babylon, and bring forth no fruit; just as there are men greedy, covetous, barren
in good works, citizens of Babylon in such wise, that they are even trees of that region; they
5696 Lat. CXXXVI. A sermon to the people
Psalm CXXXVII
Psalm CXXXVII
are fed there by these pleasures of transitory things, as though watered by “the waters of
Babylon.” Thou seekest fruit of them, and nowhere findest it.…Therefore by deferring to
apply the Scriptures to them, “we hang up our instruments of music upon the willows.” For
we hold them not worthy to carry our instruments. We do not therefore insert our instru-
ments into them and bind them to them, but defer to use them, and so hang them up. For
the willows are the unfruitful trees of Babylon, fed by temporal pleasures, as by the “waters
of Babylon.”
6. “For there they that led us captive demanded of us words of songs, and they that led
us away, an hymn” (ver. 3). They demanded of us words of songs and an hymn, who led us
captive.…We are tempted by the delights of earthly things, and we struggle daily with the
suggestions of unlawful pleasures; scarce do we breathe freely even in prayer: we understand
that we are captives. But who led us captive? what men? what race? what king? If we are re-
deemed, we once were captives. Who hath redeemed us? Christ. From whom hath He re-
deemed us? From the devil. The devil then and his angels led us captive: and they would
not lead us, unless we consented.…
7. “Those” then “who have led us captive,” the devil and his angels, when have they
spoken unto us: “Sing us one of the songs of Sion”? What answer we? Babylon beareth thee,
Babylon containeth thee, Babylon nourisheth thee, Babylon speaks by thy mouth, thou
knowest not to take in save what glitters for the present, thou knowest not how to meditate
on things of eternity, thou takest not in what thou askest. “How shall we sing the Lord’s
song in a strange land?” (ver. 4). Truly, brethren, so it is. Begin to wish to preach the truth
in such measure as ye know it, and see how needful it is for you to endure such mockers,
persecutors of the truth, full of falsehood. Reply to them, when they ask of you what they
cannot take in, and say in full confidence of your holy song, “How shall we sing the Lord’s
song in a strange land!”
8. But take heed how thou dwellest among them, O people of God, O body of Christ,
O high-born band of wanderers (for thy home is not here, but elsewhere), lest when thou
lovest them, strivest for their friendship, and fearest to displease such men, Babylon begin
to delight thee and thou forget Jerusalem. In fear then of this, see what the Psalmist subjoins,
see what follows. “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem” (ver. 5), amid the speeches of those who
hold me captive, amid the speeches of treacherous men, amid the speeches of men who ask
with ill intent, asking, yet unwilling to learn.…What then? “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let
my right hand forget me.”
9. “Let my tongue cleave to my jaws, if I remember not thee” (ver. 6). That is, let me be
dumb, he saith, if I remember not thee. For what word, what sound doth he utter, who
uttereth not songs of Sion? That is our tongue, the song of Jerusalem. The song of the love
of this world is a strange tongue, a barbarous tongue, which we have learnt in our captivity.
Dumb then will he be to God, who forgetteth Jerusalem. And it is not enough to remember:
Psalm CXXXVII
for her enemies too remember her, desiring to overthrow her. “What is that city?” say they;
“who are the Christians? what sort of men are the Christians? would they were not Christi-
ans.” Now the captive band hath conquered its capturers; still they murmur, and rage, and
desire to slay the holy city that dwells as a stranger among them. Not enough then is it to
remember: take heed how thou rememberest. For some things we remember in hate, some
in love. And so, when he had said, “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,” etc., he added at once, “if
I prefer not Jerusalem in the height of my joy.” For there is the height of joy where we enjoy
God, where we are safe of united brotherhood, and the union of citizenship. There no
tempter shall assail us, no one be able so much as to urge us on to any allurement: there
nought will delight us but good: there all want will die, there perfect bliss will dawn on us.
10. Then he turneth to God in prayer against the enemies of that city. “Remember, O
Lord, the children of Edom” (ver. 7). Edom is the same who is also called Esau: for ye heard
just now the words of the Apostle read, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”5697…Esau
then signifieth all the carnal, Jacob all the spiritual.…All carnal persons are enemies to
spiritual persons, for all such, desiring present things, persecute those whom they see to
long for things eternal. Against these the Psalmist, looking back to Jerusalem, and beseeching
God that he may be delivered from captivity, saith—what? “Remember, O Lord, the children
of Edom.” Deliver us from carnal men, from those who imitate Esau, who are elder brethren,
yet enemies. They were first-born, but the last-born have won the pre-eminence, for the
lust of the flesh hath cast down the former, the contempt of lust hath lifted up the latter.
The other live, and envy, and persecute. “In the day of Jerusalem.” The day of Jerusalem,
wherein it was tried, wherein it was held captive, or the day of Jerusalem’s happiness, wherein
it is freed, wherein it reaches its goal, wherein it is made partaker of eternity? “Remember,”
saith he, “O Lord,” forget not those “who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
thereof.” Remember then, it means, that day wherein they willed to overthrow Jerusalem.
For how great persecutions hath the Church suffered! How did the children of Edom, that
is, carnal men, servants of the devil and his angels, who worshipped stocks and stones, and
followed the lusts of the flesh, how did they say, “Extirpate the Christians, destroy the
Christians, let not one remain, overthrow them even to the foundation!” Have not these
things been said? And when they were said, the persecutors were rejected, the martyrs
crowned.…
11. Then he turneth himself to her, “O daughter of Babylon, unhappy;” unhappy in thy
very exulting, thy presumption, thine enmity; “unhappy daughter of Babylon!” (ver. 8). The
city is called both Babylon, and daughter of Babylon: just as they speak of “Jerusalem” and
“the daughter of Jerusalem,” “Sion” and “the daughter of Sion,” “the Church” and “the
daughter of the Church.” As it succeedeth the other, it is called “daughter;” as it is preferred
5697 Rom. ix. 13.
Psalm CXXXVII
before the other, it is called “mother.” There was a former Babylon; did the people remain
in it? Because it succeedeth to Babylon, it is called daughter of Babylon. O daughter of
Babylon, “unhappy” thou!…
12. “Happy shall he be that repayeth thee, as thou hast served us.” What repayment
meaneth he? Herewith the Psalm closeth, “Happy, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
against the rock” (ver. 9). Her he calleth unhappy, but him happy who payeth her as she
hath served us. Do we ask, what reward? This is the repayment. For what hath that Babylon
done to us? We have already sung in another Psalm, “The words of the wicked have prevailed
against us.”5698 For when we were born, the confusion of this world found us, and choked
us while yet infants with the empty notions of divers errors. The infant that is born destined
to be a citizen of Jerusalem, and in God’s predestination already a citizen, but meanwhile a
prisoner for a time, when learneth he to love ought, save what his parents have whispered
into his ears? They teach him and train him in avarice, robbery, daily lying, the worship of
divers idols and devils, the unlawful remedies of enchantments and amulets. What shall one
yet an infant do, a tender soul, observing what its elders do, save follow that which it seeth
them doing. Babylon then has persecuted us when little, but God hath given us when grown
up knowledge of ourselves, that we should not follow the errors of our parents.…How shall
they repay her? As she hath served us. Let her little ones be choked in turn: yea let her little
ones in turn be dashed, and die. What are the little ones of Babylon? Evil desires at their
birth. For there are, who have to fight with inveterate lusts. When lust is born, before evil
habit giveth it strength against thee, when lust is little, by no means let it gain the strength
of evil habit; when it is little, dash it. But thou fearest, lest though dashed it die not; “Dash
it against the Rock; and that Rock is Christ.”5699
13. Brethren, let not your instruments of music rest in your work: sing one to another
songs of Sion. Readily have ye heard; the more readily do what ye have heard, if ye wish not
to be willows of Babylon fed by its streams, and bringing no fruit. But sigh for the everlasting
Jerusalem: whither your hope goeth before, let your life follow; there we shall be with Christ.
Christ now is our Head; now He ruleth us from above; in that city He will fold us to Himself;
we shall be equal to the Angels of God. We should not dare to imagine this of ourselves, did
not the Truth promise it. This then desire, brethren, this day and night think on. Howsoever
the world shine happily on you, presume not, parley not willingly with your lusts. Is it a
grown-up enemy? let it be slain upon the Rock. Is it a little enemy? let it be dashed against
the Rock. Slay the grown-up ones on the Rock, and dash the little ones against the Rock.
Let the Rock conquer. Be built upon the Rock, if ye desire not to be swept away either by
the stream, or the winds, or the rain. If ye wish to be armed against temptations in this world,
5698 Ps. lxv. 3.
5699 1 Cor. x. 4.

let longing for the everlasting Jerusalem grow and be strengthened in your hearts. Your
captivity will pass away, your happiness will come; the last enemy shall be destroyed, and
we shall triumph with our King, without death.
Psalm CXXXVII
Psalm CXXXVIII.5700
1. The title of this Psalm is brief and simple, and need not detain us; since we know
whose resemblance David wore, and since in him we recognise ourselves also, for we too
are members of that Body. The whole title is, “To David himself.” Let us see then, what is
to David himself. The title of the Psalm is wont to tell us what is treated of within it: but in
this, since the title informs us not of this, but tells us only to Whom it is chanted, the first
verse tells us what is treated of in the whole Psalm, “I will confess to Thee.” This confession
then let us hear. But first I remind you, that the term confession in Scripture, when we speak
of confession to God, is used in two senses, of sin, and of praise. But confession of sin all
know, confession of praise few attend to. So well known is confession of sin, that, wherever
in Scripture we hear the words, “I will confess to Thee, O Lord,” or, “we will confess to
Thee,” forthwith, through habitually understanding in this way, our hands hurry to beating
our breast: so entirely are men wont not to understand confession to be of aught, save of
sin. But was then our Lord Jesus Christ Himself too a sinner, who saith in the Gospel, “I
confess to Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth”?5701 He goeth on to say what He confes-
seth, that we might understand His confession to be of praise, not of sin, “I confess to Thee,
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” He praised the Father, he praised God, because
He despiseth not the humble, but the proud. And such confession are we now going to hear,
of praise of God, of thanksgiving. “With my whole heart.” My whole heart I lay upon the
altar of Thy praise, an whole burnt-offering5702 of praise I offer to Thee.…“I will confess
to Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: for Thou hast heard the words of my mouth” (ver.
1). What mouth, save my heart? For there have we the voice which God heareth, which ear
of man knoweth not at all. We have then a mouth within, there do we ask, thence do we
ask, and if we have prepared a lodging or an house for God, there do we speak, there are we
heard. “For He is not far from every one of us, for in Him we live, and move, and have our
being.”5703 Nought maketh thee far off from God, save sin only. Cast down the middle wall
of sin, and thou art with Him whom thou askest.
2. “And before the Angels will I sing unto Thee.” Not before men will I sing, but before
the Angels. My song is my joy; but my joy in things below is before men, my joy in things
above before the Angels. For the wicked knoweth not the joy of the just: “There is no joy,
saith my God, to the wicked.”5704 The wicked rejoiceth in his tavern, the martyr in his chain.

Psalm CXXXVIII
In what did that holy Crispina rejoice, whose festival is kept to-day? She rejoiced when she
was being seized, when she was being carried before the judge, when she was being put into
prison, when she was being brought forth bound, when she was being lifted up on the scaf-
fold,5705 when she was being heard, when she was being condemned: in all these things she
rejoiced; and the wretches thought her wretched, when she was rejoicing before the Angels.
3. “I will worship toward Thy holy Temple” (ver. 2). What holy Temple? That where
we shall dwell, where we shall worship. For we hasten that we may adore. Our heart is
pregnant and cometh to the birth, and seeketh where it may bring forth. What is the place
where God is to be worshipped?…“The Temple of God is holy,” saith the Apostle, “which
Temple ye are.”5706 But assuredly, as is manifest, God dwelleth in the Angels. Therefore
when our joy, being in spiritual things, not in earthly, taketh up a song to God, to sing before
the Angels, that very assembly of Angels is the Temple of God, we worship toward God’s
Temple. There is a Church below, there is a Church above also; the Church below, in all the
faithful; the Church above, in all the Angels. But the God of Angels came down to the Church
below, and Angels ministered to Him on earth,5707 while He ministered to us; for, “I came
not,” saith He, “to be ministered unto, but to minister.”5708…The Lord of Angels died for
man. Therefore, “I will worship toward Thy holy Temple;” I mean, not the temple made
with hands, but that which Thou hast made for Thyself.
4. “And I will confess to Thy Name in Thy mercy and Thy truth.”…These also which
Thou hast given to me, do I according to my power give to Thee in return: mercy, in aiding
others; truth, in judging. By these God aideth us, by these we win God’s favour. Rightly,
therefore, “All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth.” No other ways are there whereby
He can come to us, no other whereby we can come to Him. “For Thou hast magnified Thy
holy Name over everything.” What sort of thanksgiving is this, brethren? He hath magnified
His holy Name over Abraham. Of Abraham was born Isaac; over that house God was mag-
nified; then Jacob; God was magnified, who said, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then came his twelve sons. The name of the Lord was
magnified over Israel. Then came the Virgin Mary. Then Christ our Lord, “dying for our
sins, rising again for our justification,” 5709 filling the faithful with His Holy Spirit, sending
forth men to proclaim throughout the Gentiles, “Repent ye,” etc.5710 Behold, “He hath
magnified His holy Name above all things.”

Psalm CXXXVIII
5. “In what day soever I call upon Thee, do Thou quickly hear me” (ver. 3). Wherefore,
“quickly”? Because Thou hast said, “While yet thou art speaking I will say, Lo, here I am.”5711
Wherefore, “quickly”? Because now I seek not earthly happiness, I have learnt holy longings
from the New Testament. I seek not earth, nor earthly abundance, nor temporal health, nor
the overthrow of my enemies, nor riches, nor rank: nought of these do I seek: therefore
“quickly hear me.” Since Thou hast taught me what to seek, grant what I seek.…
6. Let us see then what he seeketh, with what right he hath said, “quickly hear me.” For
what seekest thou, that thou shouldest quickly be heard? “Thou shalt multiply me.” In many
ways may multiplication be understood.…For men are multiplied in their soul with cares:
a man seemeth to be multiplied in soul, in whom vices even are multiplied. That is the
multiplication of want, not of fulness. What then dost thou desire, thou who hast said,
“quickly hear me,” and hast withdrawn thyself entirely from the body, from every earthly
thing, from every earthly desire, so as to say to God, “Thou shalt multiply me in my soul”?
Explain yet further what thou desirest. Thou shalt multiply me, saith he, in my soul “with
virtue.”…
7. “Let all the kings of the earth confess to Thee, O Lord” (ver. 4). So shall it be, and so
it is, and that daily; and it is shown that it was not said in vain, save that it was future. But
neither let them, when they confess to Thee, when they praise Thee, desire earthly things
of Thee. For what shall the kings of the earth desire? Have they not already sovereignty?
Whatever more a man desire on earth, sovereignty is the highest point of his desire. What
more can he desire? It must needs be some loftier eminence. But perhaps the loftier it is,
the more dangerous. And therefore the more exalted kings are in earthly eminence, the
more ought they to humble themselves before God. What do they do? “Because they have
heard all the words of Thy mouth.” In a certain nation were hidden the Law and the
Prophets, “all the words of Thy mouth:” in the Jewish nation alone were “all the words of
Thy mouth,” the nation which the Apostle praiseth, saying, “What advantage hath the Jew?
Much every way; chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.” These
were the words of God.5712…What meant Gideon’s fleece? It is like the nation of the Jews
in the midst of the world, which had the grace of sacraments, not indeed openly manifested,
but hidden in a cloud, or in a veil, like the dew in the fleece.5713 The time came when the
dew was to be manifested in the floor; it was manifested, no longer hidden. Christ alone is
the sweetness of dew: Him alone thou recognisest not in Scripture, for whom Scripture was
written. But yet, “they have heard all the words of thy mouth.”

8. “And let them sing in the paths of the Lord, that great is the glory of the Lord” (ver.
5). Let all the kings of the earth sing in the paths of the Lord. In what paths? Those that are
spoken of above, “in Thy mercy and Thy truth.” Let not then the kings of the earth be proud,
let them be humble. Then let them sing in the ways of the Lord, if they be humble: let them
love, and they shall sing. We know travellers that sing; they sing, and hasten to reach the
end of their journey. There are evil songs, such as belong to the old man; to the new man
belongeth a new song. Let then the kings of the earth too walk in Thy paths, let them walk
and sing in Thy paths. Sing what? that “great is the glory of the Lord,” not of kings.
9. See how he willed that kings should sing on their way, humbly bearing the Lord, not
lifting themselves up against the Lord. For if they lift themselves up, what follows? “For the
Lord is high, and hath respect unto the lowly” (ver. 6). Do kings then desire that He have
respect unto them? Let them be humble. What then? if they lift themselves up to pride, can
they escape His eyes? Lest perchance, because thou hast heard, “He hath respect unto the
lowly,” thou choose to be proud, and say in thy soul, God hath respect unto the lowly, He
hath not respect unto me, I will do what I will. O foolish one! wouldest thou say this, if thou
knewest what thou oughtest to love? Behold, even if God willeth not to see thee, dost thou
not fear this very thing, that He willeth not to see thee?…The lofty then, it seemeth, He hath
not respect unto, for it is the lowly He respecteth. “The lofty”—what? “He considereth from
afar.” What then gaineth the proud? To be seen from afar, not to escape being seen. And
think not that thou must needs be safe on that account, for that He seeth less clearly, who
seeth thee from afar. For thou indeed seest not clearly, what thou seest from afar; God, al-
though He see thee from afar, seeth thee perfectly, yet is He not with thee. This thou gainest,
not that thou art less perfectly seen, but that thou art not with Him by whom thou art seen.
But what doth the lowly gain? “The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart.” Let
the proud then lift himself up as much as he will, certainly God dwelleth on high, God is in
heaven: wishest thou that He come nigh to thee? Humble thyself. For the higher will He be
above thee, the more thou liftest thyself up.
10. “If I walk in the midst of tribulation, Thou shalt revive me” (ver. 7). True it is:
whatsoever tribulation thou art in, confess, call on Him; He freeth thee, He reviveth
thee.…Love the other life, and thou shalt see that this life is tribulation, whatever prosperity
it shine with, whatever delights it abound and overflow with; since not yet have we that joy
most safe and free from all temptation, which God reserveth for us in the end, without doubt
it is tribulation. Let us understand then what tribulation he meaneth here too, brethren.
Not as though he said, “If perchance there shall any tribulation have befallen me, Thou shalt
free me therefrom.” But how saith he? “If I walk,” etc.; that is, otherwise Thou wilt not revive
me, unless I walk in the midst of tribulation.
11. “Thou hast stretched forth Thine hand over the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy
right hand hath made me safe.” Let mine enemies rage: what can they do? They can take
Psalm CXXXVIII
my money, strip, proscribe, banish me; afflict me with grief and tortures; at last, if they be
allowed, even kill me: can they do aught more? But over that which mine enemies can do,
Thou hast stretched forth Thine hand. For mine enemies cannot separate me from Thee:
but Thou avengest me the more, the more Thou as yet delayest.…Yet not to make me despair;
for it follows, “and Thy right hand hath made me safe.”
12. “Thou, Lord, shalt recompense for me” (ver. 8). I recompense not: Thou shalt recom-
pense. Let mine enemies rage their full: Thou shalt recompense what I cannot.…“Dearly
beloved, avenge not yourselves,” saith the Apostle, “but rather give place unto wrath; for it
is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.”5714 There is here another sense
not to be neglected, perhaps even to be preferred. “Lord” Christ, “Thou shalt repay for me.”
For I, if I repay, have seized; Thou hast paid what Thou hast not seized. Lord, Thou shalt
“repay for me.” Behold Him repaying for us. They came to Him, who exacted tribute:5715
they used to demand as tribute a didrachma, that is, two drachmas for one man; they came
to the Lord to pay tribute; or rather, not to Him, but to His disciples, and they said to them,
“Doth not your Master pay tribute?” They came and told Him. He saith unto Peter, “lest
we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first
cometh up: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a stater: 5716 that take,
and give for Me and thee.” The first that riseth from the sea, is the First-begotten from the
dead. In His mouth we find two didrachmas, that is, four drachmas: in His mouth we find
the four Gospels. By those four drachmas we are free from the claims of this world, by the
four Evangelists we remain no longer debtors; for there the debt of all our sins is paid. He
then hath repaid for us, thanks to His mercy. He owed nothing: He repaid not for Himself:
He repaid for us.…
13. “Lord, Thy mercy is for everlasting.”…Not for a time only do I desire to be freed.
“Thy mercy is for everlasting,” wherewith Thou hast freed the martyrs, and so hast quickly
taken them from this life. “Despise not Thou the works of Thine own hands.” I say not,
Lord, “despise not the works of my hands:” of mine own works I boast not. “I sought,” indeed,
“the Lord with my hands in the night season before Him, and have not been deceived;” but
yet I praise not the works of mine own hands; I fear lest, when Thou shalt look into them,
Thou find more sins in them than deserts. Behold in me Thy Work, not mine: for mine if
Thou seest, Thou condemnest; Thine, if Thou seest, Thou crownest. For whatever good
works there be of mine, from Thee are they to me; and so they are more Thine than mine.5717

Therefore whether in regard that we are men, or in regard that we have been changed and
justified from our iniquity, Lord, “despise not Thou the works of Thine own hands.”
Psalm CXXXVIII
Psalm CXXXIX.5718
1. …Our Lord Jesus Christ speaketh in the Prophets, sometimes in His own Name,
sometimes in ours, because He maketh Himself one with us; as it is said, “they twain shall
be one flesh.” Wherefore also the Lord saith in the Gospel, speaking of marriage, “therefore
they are no more twain, but one flesh.” One flesh, because of our mortality He took flesh;
not one divinity, for He is the Creator, we the creature. Whatsoever then our Lord speaketh
in the person of the Flesh He took upon Him, belongeth both to that Head which hath
already ascended into heaven, and to those members which still toil in their earthly wander-
ing. Let us hear then our Lord Jesus Christ speaking in prophecy. For the Psalms were sung
long before the Lord was born of Mary, yet not before He was Lord: for from everlasting
He was the Creator of all things, but in time He was born of His creature. Let us believe that
Godhead, and, so far as we can, understand Him to be equal to the Father. But that Godhead
equal to the Father was made partaker of our mortal nature, not of His own store, but of
ours; that we too might be made partakers of His Divine Nature, not of our store, but of
His.
2. “Lord, Thou hast tried me, and known me” (ver. 1). Let the Lord Jesus Christ Himself
say this; let Him too say, “Lord,” to the Father. For His Father is not His Lord, save because
He hath deigned to be born according to the flesh. He is Father of the God, Lord of the Man.
Wouldest thou know to whom He is Father? To the coequal Son. The Apostle saith, “Who,
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.”5719 To this “Form”
God is Father, the “Form” equal to Himself, the only-begotten Son, begotten of His Substance.
But forasmuch as for our sakes, that we might be re-made, and made partakers of His Divine
Nature, being renewed unto life eternal, He was made partaker of our mortal nature, what
saith the Apostle of Him? He saith, “yet He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form
of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, and was found in fashion as a man.” He
was in the Form of God, equal to the Father; He took upon Him the form of a servant, so
as therein to be less than the Father.…
3. “Thou hast known My down-sitting and Mine up-rising” (ver. 2). What here is “down-
sitting,” what “up-rising”? He who sitteth, humbleth himself. The Lord then “sat” in His
Passion, “up-rose” in His Resurrection. “Thou,” he saith, hast known this; that is, Thou hast
willed, Thou hast approved; according to Thy will was it done. But if thou choosest to take
the words of the Head in the person of the Body: man sitteth when he humbleth himself in
5718 Lat. CXXXVIII. Sermon to the people. [The author says: “We had prepared us a short Psalm, and had
desired the reader to chant it; but he, through confusion at the time, as it seems, has substituted another for it.
We have chosen to follow the will of God in the reader’s mistake, rather than our own will by keeping our pur-
pose.”—C.]

Psalm CXXXIX
Psalm CXXXIX
penitence, he riseth up when his sins are forgiven, and he is lifted up to the hope of everlasting
life. Lift not up yourselves, unless ye have first been humbled. For many wish to rise before
they have sat down, they wish to appear righteous, before they have confessed that they are
sinners.…
4. “Thou hast understood my thoughts from afar; Thou hast tracked out my path and
my limit” (ver. 3); “and all my ways Thou hast seen beforehand” (ver. 4). What is, “from
afar”? While I am yet in my pilgrimage, before I reach that, my true country, Thou hast
known my thoughts.…The younger son went into a far country. After his toil and suffering
and tribulation and want, he thought on his father, and desired to return, and said, “I will
arise, and go to my father.” “I will arise,” said he, for before he had sat. Here then thou
mayest recognise him saying, “Thou hast known my down-sitting and up-rising.” I sat, in
want; I arose, in longing for Thy Bread. “Thou hast understood my thoughts from afar.”
For far indeed had I gone; but where is not He whom I had left? Wherefore the Lord saith
in the Gospel, that his father met him as he was coming. Truly; for “he had understood his
thoughts from afar.” “My path,” he saith; what, but a bad path, the path he had walked to
leave his father?…What is, “my path”? that by which I have gone. What is, “my limit”? that
whereunto I have reached. “Thou hast tracked out my path and my limit.” That limit of
mine, far distant as it was, was not far from Thine eyes. Far had I gone, and yet Thou wast
there. “And all my ways Thou hast seen beforehand.” He said not, “hast seen,” but, “hast
seen beforehand.” Before I went by them, before I walked in them, Thou didst see them
beforehand; and Thou didst permit me in toil to go my own ways, that, if I desired not to
toil, I might return into Thy ways. “For there is no deceit in my tongue.” 5720 What meant
he by this? Lo, I confess to Thee, I have walked in my own way, I am become far from Thee,
I have departed from Thee, with whom it was well with me, and to my good it was ill with
me without Thee.…
5. “Behold Thou, Lord, hast known all my last doings, and the ancient ones” (ver. 5).
Thou hast known my latest doings, when I fed swine; Thou hast known my ancient doings,
when I asked of Thee my portion of goods. Ancient doings were the beginnings to me of
latest ills: ancient sin, when we fell; latest punishment, when we came into this toilsome and
dangerous mortality. And would that this may be “latest” to us; it will be, if now we will to
return. For there is another “latest” for certain wicked ones, to whom it shall be said, “Go
ye into everlasting fire.”5721…“Thou hast fashioned me, and hast laid Thine hand upon
me.” “Fashioned me,” where? In this mortality; now, to the toils whereunto we all are born.
For none is born, but God has fashioned him in his mother’s womb; nor is there any creature,
whereof God is not the Fashioner. But “Thou hast fashioned me” in this toil, “and laid Thine
5720 Ps. cxxxix. 4.
5721 Matt. xxv. 41.
Psalm CXXXIX
hand upon me,” Thine avenging hand, putting down the proud. For thus healthfully hath
He cast down the proud, that He may lift him up humble.
6. “Thy skill hath displayed itself wonderfully in me: it hath waxed mighty: I shall not
be able to attain unto it” (ver. 6). Listen now and hear somewhat, which is obscure indeed,
yet bringeth no small pleasure in the understanding thereon. Moses, the holy servant of
God, with whom God spake by a cloud, for, speaking after human fashion, He must needs
speak to His servant through some work of His hands which He assumed,…longed and
desired to see the true appearance of God, and said to God, who was conversing with him,
“If now I have found grace in Thy sight, show me Thyself.” 5722 When this he desired
vehemently, and would extort from God in that sort of friendly familiarity, if we may so
speak, wherewith God deigned to treat him, that he might see His Glory and His Face, in
such wise as we can speak of God’s Face, He said unto him, “Thou canst not see My Face;
for no one hath seen My Face, and lived;”5723 but I will place thee in a clift of the rock, and
will pass by, and will set My hand upon thee; and when I have passed by, thou shalt see My
back parts. And from these words there ariseth another enigma, that is, an obscure figure
of the truth. “When I have passed by,” saith God, “thou shalt see My back parts;” as though
He hath on one side His face, on another His back. Far be it from us to have any such
thoughts of that Majesty! For whoso hath such thoughts of God, what advantageth it him
that the temples are closed? He is building an idol in his own heart. In these words then are
mighty mysteries.…They who raged against the Lord, whom they saw, now seek counsel
how they may be saved; and it is said to them, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in
the Name of Jesus Christ, and your sins shall be forgiven you.”5724 Behold, they saw the
back parts of Him, whose face they could not see. For His Hand was upon their eyes, not
for ever, but while He passed by. After He had passed He took away His Hand from their
eyes. When the hand was taken from their eyes, they say to the disciples, “What shall we
do?” At first they are fierce, afterwards loving; at first angry, afterwards fearful; at first hard,
then pleasant; at first blind, then enlightened.…
7. Behold thou findest that the runaway in a far country cannot escape His eyes, from
whom he fleeth. And whither can he go now, whose “limit is tracked out”? Behold, what
saith he? “Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?” (ver. 7). Who can in the world flee from that
Spirit, with whom the world is filled?5725 “And whither shall I flee from Thy Face?” He
seeketh a place whither to flee from the wrath of God. What place will shelter God’s runaway?
Men who shelter runaways, ask them from whom they have fled; and when they find any

5723 Exod. xxxiii. 20.
5724 Acts ii. 38.

Psalm CXXXIX
one a slave of some master less powerful than themselves, him they shelter as it were without
any fear, saying in their hearts, “he hath not a master by whom he can be tracked out.” But
when they are told of a powerful master, they either shelter not, or they shelter with great
fear, because even a powerful man can be deceived. Where is God not? Who can deceive
God? Whom doth not God see? From whom doth not God demand His runaway? Whither
then shall that runaway go from the Face of God? He turneth him hither and thither, as
though seeking a spot to flee to.
8. “If I go up,” saith he, “to heaven, Thou art there: if I go down to Hades, Thou art
present” (ver. 8). At length, miserable runaway, thou hast learnt, that by no means canst
thou make thyself far from Him, from whom thou hast wished to remove far away. Behold,
He is everywhere; thou, whither wilt thou go? He hath found counsel, and that inspired by
Him, who now deigneth to recall him.…If by sinning I go down to the depths of wicked-
nesses, and spurn to confess, saying, “Who seeth me” (for “in Hades who shall confess to
Thee?”5726) there also Thou art present, to punish. Whither then shall I go that I may flee
from Thy presence, that is, not find Thee angry? This plan he found: So will I flee, saith he,
from Thy Face, so will I flee from Thy Spirit; from Thy avenging Spirit, Thy avenging Face
thus will I flee. How? “If I take again my wings right forward, and abide in the utmost parts
of the sea” (ver. 9). So can I flee from Thy Face. If he will flee to the utmost part of the sea
from the Face of God, will not He from whom he fleeth be there?…For what are “the utmost
parts of the sea,” but the end of the world? Thither let us now flee in hope and longing, with
the wings of twofold love; let us have no rest, save in “the utmost parts of the sea.” For if
elsewhere we wish for rest, we shall be hurled headlong into the sea. Let us fly even to the
ends of the sea, let us bear ourselves aloft on the wings of twofold love; meanwhile let us
flee to God in hope, and in faithful hope let us meditate on that “end of the sea.”
9. Now listen who may bring us thither. The very same One whose face in wrath we
wish to flee from. For what followeth? “Even thither shall Thy hand conduct me, and Thy
right hand lead me” (ver. 10). This let us meditate on, beloved brethren, let this be our hope,
this our consolation. Let us take again through love the wings we lost through lust. For lust
was the lime of our wings, it clashed us down from the freedom of our sky, that is, the free
breezes of the Spirit of God. Thence dashed down we lost our wings, and were, so to speak,
imprisoned in the power of the fowler; thence “He” redeemed us with His Blood, whom we
fled from to be caught. He maketh us wings of His commandments; we raise them aloft now
free from lime.…Needs then must we have wings, and needs must He conduct us, for He
is our Helper. We have free-will; but even with that free-will what can we do, unless He help
us who commandeth us?
5726 Ps. vi. 5.
Psalm CXXXIX
10. And considering the length of the way, what said he to himself? “And I said, Perad-
venture the darkness shall overwhelm me” (ver. 11). Lo, now I have believed in Christ, now
am I wafted aloft on the wings of twofold love.…Regarding the length of the way, I said to
myself, “And the night was light in my delight.” The night was made to me light, because
in the night I despaired of being able to cross so great a sea, to surmount so long a journey,
to reach the utmost parts by persevering to the end. Thanks to Him who sought me when
a runaway, who smote my back with strokes of the scourge, who by calling me recalled me
from destruction, who made my night light. For it is night so long as we are passing through
this life. How was the night made light? Because Christ came down into the night.…
11. “For darkness shall not be darkened by Thee” (ver. 12). Do not thou then darken
thy darkness; God darkeneth it not, but enlighteneth it yet more; for to Him is said in another
Psalm, “Thou, Lord, shalt light my candle: my God shall enlighten my darkness.”5727 But
who are they who “darken their darkness,” which God darkeneth not? Evil men, perverse
men; when they sin, verily they are darkness; when they confess not their sins which they
have committed but go on to defend them, they “darken their darkness.” Wherefore now
if thou hast sinned thou art in darkness, but by confessing thy darkness thou shalt obtain
to have thy darkness lightened; by defending thy darkness, thou shalt “darken thy darkness.”
And where wilt thou escape from double darkness, who wast in difficulty in single dark-
ness?…Let us not “darken our darkness” by defending our sins, and “the night shall be light
in our delight.”
12. “And night shall be lightened as the day.” “Night, as the day.” “Day” to us is worldly
prosperity, night adversity in this world: but, if we learn that it is by the desert of our sins
that we suffer adversities, and our Father’s scourges are sweet to us, that the Judge’s sentence
may not be bitter to us, so shall we find the darkness of this night to be, as it were, the light
of this night.…But when Christ our Lord has come, and has dwelt in the soul by faith, and
promised other light, and inspired and given patience, and warned a man not to delight in
prosperity or to be crushed by adversity, the man, being faithful, begins to treat this world
with indifference; not to be lifted up when prosperity befalls him, nor crushed when adversity,
but in all things to praise God, not only when he aboundeth, but also when he loseth; not
only when he is in health, but also when he is sick.5728…“As is His darkness, so is also His
light.” His darkness overwhelms me not, because His light lifts me not up.
13. “For Thou, O Lord, hast possessed my reins” (ver. 13). The Possessor is within; He
occupieth not only the heart, but also the reins; not only the thoughts, but also the delights:
He then possesseth that whence I should feel delight at any light in this world: He occupieth
5727 Ps. xviii. 28.
5728 Ps. xxxiv. 1.
Psalm CXXXIX
my reins: I know not delight, save from the inward light of His Wisdom. What then? Dost
thou not delight that thy affairs are very prosperous, times fortunate to thee? dost thou not
delight in honour, in riches, in thy family? “I do not,” saith he. Wherefore? Because “Thou
hast possessed my reins, O Lord; Thou hast taken me up from my mother’s womb.” While
I was in my mother’s womb, I did not regard with indifference the darkness of that night
and the light of that night.…Now, having been taken up from the womb of that our mother,
we look on them with indifference, and say, “As is His darkness, so is also His light.” Neither
doth earthly prosperity make us happy, nor earthly adversity wretched. We must maintain
righteousness, love faith, hope in God, love God, love our neighbours also. After these toils
we shall have unfailing light, day without setting. Fleeting is all the light and darkness of
this night.
14. “I will confess to Thee, O Lord, for terribly hast Thou been made wonderful: won-
drous are Thy works, and my soul knoweth it right well” (ver. 14). Aforetime “Thy knowledge
was made wonderful from me, it had waxed great, nor could I attain unto it.” From me then
“it had waxed great.” Whence doth “my soul” now “know right well,” save because the “night
is light in my delight?” save because Thy grace hath come unto me, and enlightened my
darkness? save because Thou hast possessed my reins? save because Thou hast taken me up
from my mother’s womb?
15. “My bone is not hid from Thee, which Thou hast made in secret” (ver. 15). “His
bone,” he saith. What the people call ossum, is in Latin called os. This is the word in the
Greek.5729 For we might think the word os is here the one which makes in the plural ora,
not os (short), which makes ossa. He saith then, I have a certain bone (ossum) in secret. For
this word let us prefer to use; better is it that scholars find fault with us, than that the people
understand us not. “There is then,” saith he, “a certain bone of mine, within, hidden; Thou
hast made within a bone for me in secret, yet is it not hidden from Thee. In secret hast Thou
made it, but hast Thou therefore hidden it from Thyself? This my bone made by Thee in
secret men see not, men know not: Thou knowest, who hast made. What “bone” then
meaneth he, brethren? Let us seek it, it is “in secret.” But because as Christians we are
speaking in the Name of the Lord to Christians, now we find what bone is of this kind. It is
a sort of inward strength; for strength and fortitude are understood to be in the bones. There
is then a sort of inward strength of the soul, wherein it is not broken. Whatever tortures,
whatever tribulations, whatever adversities rage around, that which God hath made strong
in secret in us, cannot be broken, yieldeth not. For by God is made a certain strength of
patience, of which is said in another Psalm, “But my soul shall be subjected to God, for of
Him is my patience.”5730…Wherein dost thou glory? “In tribulations, knowing that tribu-
5729 Gr. ὀστοῦν.
5730 Ps. lxii. 5.
Psalm CXXXIX
lation worketh patience.”5731 See how that strength is fashioned within in his heart: “because
the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.” So
is fashioned and made strong that hidden bone, that it maketh us even to glory in tribulations.
But to men we seem wretched, because that which we have within is hidden from them.
“And my substance is in the lower parts of the earth.” Behold, in flesh is my substance, yet
have I a bone within, which Thou hast fashioned, such as to cause me never to yield to any
persecutions of this lower region, where still my substance is. For what great matter is it, if
an Angel be brave? This is a great matter, if flesh is brave. And whence is flesh brave, whence
is an earthen vessel brave, save because in it is made a bone in secret?
16. …“Thine eyes did see Mine imperfect one, and in Thy book shall all be written”
(ver. 16), not only the perfect, but also the imperfect. Let not the imperfect fear, only let
them advance. Nor yet, because I have said, “let them not fear,” let them love their imperfec-
tion, and remain there, where they are found. Let them advance, as far as in them lieth. Daily
let them add, daily let them approach; yet let them not fall back from the Body of the Lord:
that, compacted in one Body and among these members, they may be counted worthy to
have that said of them. “By day shall they wander, and none among them.” “The Day” was
yet on earth, even our Lord Jesus Christ. Whence He said, “Walk while ye have the day.”5732
But “by day shall” His imperfect ones “wander.” They too thought that our Lord Jesus Christ
was only man, that He had not within Him the hidden Godhead, that He was not secretly
God, but that He was that only which was seen: this they too thought.…But what is, “In the
day they shall wander”? Shall they perish? Where then is, “In Thy book shall all be written”?
When then did they “wander in the day”? When they understood not the Lord set upon
earth. And what followeth? “But to me Thy friends are made very honourable, O God” (ver.
17); those very ones, who “wandered in the day, and none was in them,” became Thy friends,
and were made very honourable to me. That bone was made in them in secret after the re-
surrection of the Lord, and they suffered for His Name, at whose death they had been amazed.
“Mightily strengthened were their chieftainships.” They became Apostles, they became
leaders of the Church, they became rams leading their flocks, “mightily strengthened.”
17. “I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand” (ver. 18). By means
of them, who “wandered in the day,” lo! there has been born all this great multitude, which
now is like the sand innumerable, save by God. For He said, “they shall be multiplied above
the sand,” and yet He had said, “I will number them.” The very same who are numbered,
“shall be multiplied above the sand.” For by Him is the sand numbered, by whom “the very
hairs of our head are numbered.”5733 “I have risen, and yet am I with Thee.” Already have
5731 Rom. iv. 5.
5732 John xii. 35.
5733 Matt. x. 30.
Psalm CXXXIX
I suffered, saith He, already have I been buried; lo! I have risen, and not yet do they under-
stand that I am with them. “Yet am I with Thee,” that is, not yet with them, for not yet do
they recognise Me. For thus do we read in the Gospel, that after the resurrection of oar Lord
Jesus Christ, when He appeared to them, they did not at once know Him. There is another
meaning also: “I have risen, and yet am I with Thee,” as though He would signify this present
time, wherein He is as yet hidden at the right hand of the Father, before He is revealed in
the brightness, wherein He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
18. And then He telleth what meanwhile, during this whole time when He already has
risen, and remaineth still with the Father, He suffereth by the intermixture of sinners in His
Body, the Church, and by the separation of heretics. “If Thou, O God, shalt slay the sinners
(since Thou shalt say in Thy thought, Depart from Me, ye men of blood), they shall receive
in vanity their cities” (ver. 19, 20). The words seem to be connected in this order; “If Thou,
O God, shall slay the sinners, they shall receive in vanity their cities.” Thus are sinners slain,
because, “having their understandings darkened, they are alienated from the life of God.”5734
For on account of elation they lose confession, and so they are slain, and in them is fulfilled
what Scripture saith, “Confession perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not.”5735
And so “they receive in vanity their cities,” that is, their vain peoples, who follow their vanity;
when, puffed up by the name of righteousness, they5736 persuade men to burst the bond of
unity, and blindly and ignorantly follow them, as being more righteous.…But now the Body
of Christ, the Church, saith, Why do the proud speak falsely against me, as though I were
stained by other men’s sins, and so, by separating themselves, “receive in vanity their cities”?
“Have not I hated those who hated Thee, Lord?” (ver. 21). Why do those who are worse
themselves require of me to separate myself in body as well as spirit from the wicked, so as
to root up the wheat, together with the tares, before the time of harvest, that before the time
of winnowing I lose my power of enduring the chaff; that before all the different sorts of
fishes are brought to the end of the world, as to the shore, to be separated, I tear the nets of
peace and unity? Are the sacraments which I receive, those of evil men? Do I; by consent,
communicate in their life and deeds?…But where is, “Love your enemies”? Is it because He
said “yours,” not “God’s”? “Do good to them that hate you.”5737 He saith not, “who hate
God.” So he followeth the pattern, and saith, “Have not I hated those who hated Thee; Lord?”
He saith not, “Who have hated me.” “And at Thine enemies did I waste away.” “Thine,” he
said, not “mine.” But those who hate us and are enemies unto us, only because we serve
Him, what else do they but hate Him, and are His enemies. Ought we then to love such en-

Psalm CXXXIX
emies as these? Or do not they suffer persecution for God’s sake, to whom it is said, “Pray
for them that persecute you”? Observe then what followeth. “With a perfect hatred did I
hate them” (ver. 22). What is, “with a perfect hatred”? I hated in them their iniquities, I
loved Thy creation. This it is to hate with a perfect hatred, that neither on account of the
vices thou hate the men, nor on account of the men love the vices. For see what he addeth,
“They became mine enemies.” Not only as God’s enemies, but as his own too doth he now
describe them. How then will he fulfil in them both his own saying, “Have not I hated those
that hated Thee, Lord,” and the Lord’s command, “Love your enemies”? How will he fulfil
this, save with that “perfect hatred,” that he hate in them that they are wicked, and love that
they are men? For in the time even of the Old Testament, when the carnal people was re-
strained by visible punishments, how did Moses, the servant of God, who by understanding
belonged to the New Testament, how did he hate sinners when he prayed for them, or how
did he not hate them when he slew them, save that he “hated them with a perfect hatred”?
For with such perfection did he hate the iniquity which he punished, as to love the manhood
for which he prayed.
19. Since then the Body of Christ is in the end to be severed in body also from the unholy
and wicked, but now meanwhile groaneth among them, what doeth the “love of Christ
among the daughters, as the lily among thorns”?5738 What are her words? what her con-
science? what is the “appearance of the king’s daughter within”?5739 Lo, hear what she saith.
“Prove me, O God, and know my heart” (ver. 23). Do Thou, O God, Thou prove me, Thou
know; not man, not an heretic, who neither knoweth how to prove, nor can know my heart,
whereas Thou provest, and knowest that I consent not to the deeds of the wicked, while
they think that I can be defiled by the sins of others; so that, while I in my long wandering
do what I mourn in another Psalm, that is, while I “labour for peace among them that hate
peace,”5740 until I come to that Vision of peace, which is called Jerusalem, “which is the
mother of us all,” the city “eternal in the heavens;” they, contending, and falsely accusing
and separating themselves, may “receive,” not, evidently, in eternity, but “in vanity, their
cities.” Why this? Observe what followeth.
20. “And see,” saith he, “if there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the
way everlasting” (ver. 24). “Search,” he saith, “my paths,” that is, my counsels and thoughts.
What else saith he, but “lead me in Christ”? For who is “the way everlasting,” save He that
is the life everlasting? For everlasting is He who said, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the
Life.”5741 If then thou findest anything in my way which displeaseth Thine eyes, since my

way is mortal, do Thou “lead me in the way everlasting,” wherein is no iniquity; for even “if
any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the
propitiation for our sins;”5742 He is “the Way everlasting” without sin; He is the Life ever-
lasting without punishment.
21. These are great mysteries, brethren. How doth the Spirit of God speak with us? how
doth it make us delights in this night? What is this, we ask you, brethren, whence are they
sweeter, the darker they are? He mixeth us our potion after His love, in certain wondrous
ways. He maketh His own sayings wondrous, so that while we were speaking what ye already
knew, yet forasmuch as it was dug out of passages which seemed obscure, the knowledge
itself seemed to be made new. Did ye not know, brethren, that the wicked are to be tolerated
in the Church, and schisms not to be made? Did ye not already know, that within those nets
which hold both good and bad fishes, we must abide even to the shore, nor must the nets
be burst, because on the shore the good shall be separated into vessels, and the bad thrown
away? Ye know this already; but these verses of this Psalm ye did not understand; that which
ye did not understand is explained; that which ye knew has been renewed.
5742 1 John ii. 1, 2.
Psalm CXXXIX
Psalm CXL.5743
1. Our Lords have bidden me, brethren, and in them the Lord of all, to bring this Psalm
to your understanding, so far as God giveth me to. May He help your prayers, that I may
say those things which I ought to say, ye to hear, that to all of us the Word of God may be
profitable. For all it doth not profit, for “all have not faith.”5744…
2. What this Psalm containeth, I believe that ye perceived when it was being chanted;
for therein the Church of Christ, set in the midst of the wicked, complaineth and groaneth,
and poureth out prayer to God. For her voice is in every such prophecy the voice of one in
need and want, not yet satisfied, “hungering and thirsting after righteousness,”5745 for whom
a certain fulness in the end hath been promised, and is reserved.…
3. “To the end, a Psalm to David himself.” No other end mayest thou look to, than is
laid down for thee by the Apostle himself. For “Christ is the end.”5746…He was of the seed
of David, not after His Godhead, whereby He is the Creator of David, but after the flesh;
therefore He deigned to be called David in prophecy: look to this “end,” for the Psalm is
chanted “to David Himself;” hear the voice of His Body; be in His Body. Let the voice which
thou hast heard be thine, and pray, and say what followeth.
4. “Deliver me, O Lord, from the wicked man” (ver. 1). Not from one only, but from
the class; not from the vessels only, but from their prince himself, that is, the devil. Why
“from man,” if he meaneth from the devil? Because he too is called a man in a fig-
ure.5747…Now then being made light, not in ourselves, but in the Lord,5748 let us pray not
only against darkness, that is, against sinners, whom still the devil possesseth, but also against
their prince, the devil himself, who worketh in the children of disobedience. “Deliver me
from the unrighteous man.” The same as “from the wicked man.” For he called him wicked
because unrighteous, lest perchance thou shouldest think that any unrighteous man could
be a good man. For many unrighteous men seem to be harmless; they are not fierce, are not
savage, do not persecute nor oppress; yet are they unrighteous, because, following some
other habit, they are luxurious, drunkards, given to pleasure.…Wicked then is every unright-
eous man, who must needs be harmful, whether he be gentle or fierce. Whoever falls in his
way, whoever is taken by his snares, will find how harmful is that which he thought harmless.
For, brethren, even thorns prick not with their roots. Pull up thorns from the ground, handle
their roots, and see whether thou feelest pain. Yet that in the upgrowth which causeth thee

pain, proceeded from that root. Let not then men please you who seem gentle and kind, yet
are lovers of carnal pleasure, followers of polluted lusts, let them not please you. Though as
yet they seem gentle, they are roots of thorns.…And so, my brethren, body of Christ,
members of Christ groaning among such wicked men, whomsoever ye find hurrying headlong
into evil lusts and deadly pleasures, at once chide, at once punish, at once burn. Let the root
be burnt, and there remaineth not whence the thorn may grow up. If ye cannot, be sure that
ye will have them as enemies. They may be silent, they may hide their enmity, but they
cannot love you. But since they cannot love you, and since they who hate you must needs
seek your harm, let not your tongue and heart be slow to say to God, “Deliver me, O Lord,
from the unrighteous man.”
5. “Who have imagined unrighteousnesses in their heart” (ver. 2).…From them free
me, from them let Thy hand be most powerful to deliver me. For easy is it to avoid open
enmities, easy is it to turn aside from an enemy declared and manifest, while iniquity is in
his lips as well as his heart; he is a troublesome enemy, he is secret, he is with difficulty
avoided, who beareth good things in his lips, while in his heart he concealeth evil things.
“All the day long did they make war.” What is, “war”? They made for me what I was to fight
against all the day. For from thence, from such hearts as these, ariseth all that the Christian
fighteth against. Be it sedition, be it schism, be it heresy, be it turbulent opposition, it
springeth not save from these imaginings which were concealed, and while they spake good
words with their lips, “all the day long did they make war.” Ye hear words of peace, yet
making war departeth not from their thoughts. For the words, “all the day long,” signify
without intermission, throughout the whole time. “They have sharpened their tongues like
serpents” (ver. 3). If still thou seekest to make out the man, behold a comparison. In the
serpent above all beasts is there cunning and craft to hurt; for therefore does it creep.5749
It hath not even feet, so that its footsteps when it cometh may be heard. In its progress it
draweth itself, as it were, gently along, yet not straightly. Thus then do they creep and crawl
to hurt, having poison hidden even under a gentle touch. And so it followeth, “the poison
of asps is under their lips.” Behold, it is “under” their lips, that we may perceive one thing
under their lips, another in their lips.…
6. “Preserve me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner, from unrighteous men deliver
me” (ver. 4). Here they wear their real colours, they are known; here we have no need to
understand, but to act: we have need to pray, not to ask who they are. But how thou
shouldest pray against such men, he explaineth in what followeth. For many pray unskilfully
against wicked men. “Who have imagined,” saith he, “to trip up my steps.” Thus far it may
be understood carnally. Every one has enemies, who seek to cheat him in trade, to rob him
of money, where they are engaged together in business; every one has some neighbour his
5749 Serpit.
Psalm CXL
enemy, who deviseth how to bring mischief upon his family, to injure in some way his
property and surely he deviseth this by deceit, by fraud, by devilish devices he endeavoureth
to accomplish this: no one can doubt it. Yet not for these reasons are they to be guarded
against, but lest they lay in wait for thee and draw thee to themselves, that is, separate thee
from the Body of Christ, and make thee of their body. For as Christ is the Head of the good,
so is the devil their head. What is, “to trip up my steps”? Not as though thou shouldest be
deceived in the business thou hast with him, or he cheat thee in a case which thou hast with
him in the law courts. He hath “tripped up thy steps,” if he have hindered thee in the way
of God; so that what thou didst direct aright may stumble, or fall from the way, or fall in
the way, or draw back from the way, or stop on the way, or go back to the place from whence
it had come. Whatsoever hath done this to thee, hath tripped thee up, hath deceived thee.
Against such snares as these pray thou, lest thou lose thy heavenly inheritance, lest thou
lose Christ thy Joint-heir, for thou art destined to live for ever with Him, who hath made
thee an heir. For thou art made an heir, not by one whom thou art to succeed after his death,
but One together with whom thou art to live for ever.
7. “The proud have hidden a trap for me” (ver. 5). He hath briefly described the whole
body of the devil, when he saith, “the proud.” Hence is it that for the most part they call
themselves righteous when they are unrighteous. Hence is it that nothing is so grievous to
them as to confess their sins. They are men who, being falsely righteous, must needs envy
the truly righteous. For none envieth another in that which he wisheth not either to be or
to seem.…Hence come all allurings and trippings up of others. This the devil first wished,
when falling himself he envied man who stood.…
8. But those “proud ones have hidden a trap for me;” they have sought to trip up my
steps. And what have they done? “And have stretched out cords as traps.” What cords? The
word is well known in holy Scripture, and elsewhere we find what “cords” signify. For “each
one is holden with the cords of his sins,”5750 saith Scripture. And Esaias saith openly, “Woe
to them that draw sin like a long rope.”5751 And why is it called a “cord”? Because every
sinner who persevereth in his sins, addeth sin to sin; and when he ought by accusing his
sins to amend, by defending he doubleth what by confession he might have removed, and
often seeketh to fortify himself by other sins, on account of the sins he hath already commit-
ted.…But these their sins they “spread” for the righteous, when they persuade them to do
the evils which they themselves do. Therefore he said, “they spread cords and traps;” that
is, by their sins they desired to overthrow me. And where did they this? “Beside the paths
have they laid a stumbling-block for me:” not in the paths, but, “beside the paths.” Thy
“paths” are the commandments of God. They have “laid stumbling-blocks beside the paths;”
5750 Prov. v. 22.
5751 Isa. v. 18.
Psalm CXL
do not thou withdraw out of the paths, and thou wilt not rush upon stumbling-blocks. Yet
will I not that thou shouldest say, “God should prevent them from laying stumbling-blocks
beside my paths, and then they would not lay them.” Nay, rather, God permitted them to
“lay stumbling-blocks beside thy paths,” that thou shouldest not leave the paths.
9. And what remaineth? what remedy amid such ills, in such temptations, such dangers?
“I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God” (ver. 6). Loud is the voice of prayer, it exciteth
confidence. Is He not the God of the others? Of whom is not He God, who is the true God?
Yet is He specially theirs, who enjoy Him, who serve Him, who willingly submit to Him.
For the wicked too, though unwillingly, are subject to Him.…“Hear with Thine ears the
voice of my prayer.” He did not say, “Hear with Thine ears my prayer;” but, as though ex-
pressing more plainly the affection of his heart, “the voice of my prayer,” the life of my
prayer, the soul of my prayer, not that which soundeth in my words, but that which giveth
life to my words. For all other noises without life may be called sounds, but not words.
Words belong to those that have souls, to the living. But how many pray to God, yet have
neither perception of God, nor right thoughts concerning God! These may have the sound
of prayer, the voice they cannot, for there is no life in them. This was the voice of the prayer
of one who was alive, forasmuch as he understood that God was his God, saw by Whom he
was freed, perceived from whom he was freed.
10. Commending this to the ears of God, let him say, “Lord, Lord.” Thou Lord-Lord,
that is, most truly Lord, not like unto the lords-men, not like the lords who buy with money-
bags, but the Lord who buyeth with His Blood. “Lord, Lord, Thou strength of my health”
(ver. 7), that is, who givest strength to my health. What is the meaning of “strength of my
health”? He complained of the stumbling-blocks and snares of sinners, of wicked men,
vessels of the devil, that barked around him and laid snares around him, of the proud that
envy the righteous. But He forthwith added a comfort, “He that shall endure unto the end,
the same shall be saved.” This he observed and feared, and, distressed at the abundance of
iniquities, turned himself to hope. Verily I shall be saved, if I endure unto the end: but en-
durance, so as to win salvation, pertaineth unto strength; Thou art “the strength of my sal-
vation;” Thou makest me to endure, that I may attain salvation.…Toiling then in this warfare,
he looked back to the grace of God; and because already he had begun to be heated and
parched, he found, as it were, a shade, whereunder to live. “Thou hast overshadowed my
head in the day of battle:” that is, in the heat, lest I be heated, lest I be parched.
11. “Deliver me not over, O Lord, by my own longing to the sinner” (ver. 8). Behold to
what end Thy overshadowing shall avail for me, that I suffer not heat from myself. And
what could that “sinner” do to me, rage as he would? For wicked men raged against the
martyrs, dragged them away, bound them with chains, shut them up in prisons, slew them
with the sword, exposed them to wild beasts, consumed them with fire: all this they did; yet
did not God deliver them over to the sinners, because they were not delivered over by their
Psalm CXL
own longing. This then pray with all thy might, that God “delivered thee not over by thine
own longing to the sinner.” For thou by thine own longing givest place to the devil. For lo,
the devil hath set before thee gain, invited thee to dishonesty; thou canst not have the gain,
unless thou commit the dishonesty: the gain is the bait, dishonesty the snare: do thou so
look on the bait, that thou see the snare also; for thou canst not obtain the gain, unless thou
commit the dishonesty; and if thou commit the dishonesty, thou wilt be caught.…Hence is
thine head overshadowed in the day of battle. For longing causeth heat, but the overshad-
owing of the Lord tempers longing, that we may be able to bridle that whereby we were being
hurried away, that we be not so heated as to be drawn to the snare. “They have thought
against me; leave me not, lest perchance they be exalted.” Thou hast in another place, “They
that oppress me will exult if I be moved.”5752 Such are they, because such is the devil also
himself.…
12. “The head of their going about, the toil of their own lips shall cover them” (ver. 9).
Me, he saith, the shadow of Thy wings shall cover: for, “Thou hast covered me in the day
of battle.” Them what shall cover? “The head of their going about;” that is, pride. What is,
“their going about”? How they go about and stand not, how they go in the circle of error,
where is journeying without end. He who goeth in a straight line, beginneth from some
point, endeth at some point: he who goeth in a circle, never endeth. That is the toil of the
wicked, which is set forth yet more plainly in another Psalm, “The wicked walk in a
circle.”5753 But “the head of their going about” is pride, for pride is the beginning of every
sin. But whence is pride “the toil of their own lips”? Every proud man is false, and every
false man is a liar. Men toil in speaking falsehood; for truth they could speak with entire
facility. For he toileth, who maketh what he saith: he who wisheth to speak the truth, toileth
not, for truth herself speaketh without toil.…
13. “Coals of fire shall fall upon them upon earth, and Thou shalt cast them down” (ver.
10). What is, “upon earth”? Here, even in this life, here “coals of fire shall fall upon them.”
What are, “coals of fire”? We know these coals. Are they different from those of which we
are about to speak? For these I see avail for punishment, those that I am about to speak of,
for salvation. For we have spoken of certain coals, when man was seeking aid against a
treacherous tongue.…The examples of the “coals” are added to the wound of the arrows
(for I need not fear to say “the wound,” when the Spouse herself saith, “I am wounded with
love”5754), and then the hay is consumed, and so they are called “devouring coals.” The hay
is devoured, but the gold is purified, and the man exchanges death for life, and begins to be
himself too a burning coal; such a coal as was the Apostle, “who before was a blasphemer
5752 Ps. xiii. 4.
5753 Ps. xii. 8.
5754 Cant. ii. 5, LXX.
Psalm CXL
and a persecutor and injurious,” a coal black and extinguished; but when he had obtained
mercy, he was set on fire from heaven, the voice of Christ set him on fire, all the blackness
in him perished, he began to be fervent in spirit, to set others on fire with that wherewith
he was set on fire himself.…
14. “A man full of words shall not be guided upon earth” (ver. 11). “A man full of words”
loveth lies. For what pleasure hath he, save in speaking? He careth not what he speaketh, so
long as he speaks. It cannot be that he will be guided. What then ought the servant of God
to do, who is kindled with these “coals,” and himself made a coal of salvation, what should
he do? He should wish rather to hear than to speak; as it is written, “Let every man be swift
to hear, slow to speak.” 5755 And if it may be so, let him desire this, not to be obliged to
speak and talk and teach.…I can quickly tell you wherein each one may prove himself, not
by never speaking, but by requiring a case where it is his duty to speak; let him be glad to
be silent, in will, let him speak to teach, when he must. For when must thou needs speak
and teach? When thou meetest with one ignorant, when thou meetest with one unlearned.
If it delight thee always to teach, thou wishest always to have some ignorant one to
teach.…“Evil shall hunt the unrighteous man to destruction.” Evils come, and he standeth
not; therefore said he, “they shall hunt him to destruction.” For many good men, many
righteous men evils have befallen, evils have, as it were, found them. Therefore when the
evil pursued the good, that is, our martyrs, when they seized them, they “hunted” them, but
not “to destruction.” For the flesh was pressed down, the spirit was crowned; the spirit was
cast out from the body, yet was nought done to the flesh which might hinder it for the future.
Let the flesh be burned, scourged, mangled; is it therefore withdrawn from its Creator, be-
cause it is given into the hands of its persecutor? Will not He who created it from nothing,
remake it better than it was?
15. “I know that the Lord will maintain the right of the needy” (ver. 12). This “needy”
one is not “full of words;” for he that is full of words, wisheth to abound, knoweth not to
hunger. He is “needy” of whom it is said, “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness, for they shall be filled.”5756 They groan among the stumbling-blocks of the
wicked, they pray to their Head, “to be delivered from the wicked man. “And the cause of
the poor.” These then are they whose cause the Lord will not neglect; although now they
suffer hardships, their glory shall appear, when their Head appeareth. For to such while
placed here it is said, “Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”5757 So then we
are poor, our life is hid; let us cry to Him that is our Bread.5758…

cause, and when Thou shalt maintain their right, they “shall confess to Thy Name;” nought
shall they attribute to their own merits, all they shall attribute to nought save to Thy
mercy.…Therefore see what followeth, see wherewith he concludeth. “The upright shall
dwell with Thy Countenance.” For ill was it with them in their own countenance; well will
it be with them with Thy Countenance. For when they loved their own countenance, “In
the sweat of their countenance did they eat bread.”5759 Thy Countenance shall come to
them with abundance to satisfy them. Nought more shall they seek, for nought better have
they; no more shall they abandon Thee, nor be abandoned by Thee. For after His Resurrec-
tion, what was said of the Lord? “Thou shalt fill me with joy with Thy Countenance.”5760
Without His Countenance He would not give us joy. For this do we cleanse our countenance,
that we may rejoice in His Countenance.5761…Because too, “blessed are the poor in heart,
for they shall see God;”5762 He gave the Form of Man both to good and evil, the Form of
God He preserved for the pure and good, that we may rejoice in Him, and it may be well
with us for ever with His Countenance.

Psalm CXLI.5763
1. …The Psalm which we have just sung is in many parts somewhat obscure. When by
the help of the Lord what has been said shall begin to be expounded and explained, ye will
see that ye are hearing things which ye knew already. But for this cause are they said in
manifold ways, that variety of expression may remove all weariness of the truth.…
2. “Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hear Thou me” (ver. 1). This we all can say. This not
I alone say: whole Christ saith it. But it is said rather in the name of the Body: for He too,
when He was here and bore our flesh, prayed; and when He prayed, drops of blood streamed
down from His whole Body. So is it written in the Gospel: “Jesus prayed earnestly, and His
sweat was as it were great drops of blood.”5764 What is this flowing of sweat from His whole
Body, but the suffering of martyrs from the whole Church? “Listen unto the voice of my
prayer, while I cry unto Thee.” Thou thoughtest the business of crying already finished,
when thou saidst, “I have cried unto Thee.” Thou hast cried; yet think not thyself safe. If
tribulation be finished, crying is finished: but if tribulation remain for the Church, for the
Body of Christ, even to the end of the world, let it not only say, “I have cried unto Thee,”
but also, “Listen unto the voice of my prayer.”
3. “Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as incense, and the lifting up of my hands an
evening sacrifice” (ver. 2). That this is wont to be understood of the Head Himself, every
Christian acknowledgeth. For when the day was now sinking towards evening, the Lord
upon the Cross “laid down His life to take it again,”5765 did not lose it against His will. Still
we too are figured there. For what of Him hung upon the tree, save what He took of us?
And how can it be that the Father should leave and abandon His only begotten Son, especially
when He is one God with Him? Yet, fixing our weakness upon the Cross, where, as the
Apostle saith, “our old man is crucified with Him,”5766 He cried out in the voice of that our
“old man,” “Why hast Thou forsaken Me?”5767 That then is the “evening sacrifice,” the
Passion of the Lord, the Cross of the Lord, the offering of a salutary Victim, the whole burnt
offering acceptable to God. That “evening sacrifice” produced, in His Resurrection, a
morning offering. Prayer then, purely directed from a faithful heart, riseth like incense from
a hallowed altar. Nought is more delightful than the odour of the Lord: such odour let all
have who believe.
4. …“Set, O Lord, a watch before my mouth, and a door of restraint around my lips”
(ver. 3). He said not a barrier of restraint, but “a door of restraint.” A door is opened as well

as shut. If then it be a “door,” let it be both opened and shut; opened, to confession of sin;
closed, to excusing sin. So will it be a “door of restraint,” not of ruin. For what doth this
“door of restraint” profit us? What doth Christ pray in the name of His Body? “That Thou
turn not aside My heart to wicked words” (ver. 4). What is, “My heart”? The heart of My
Church; the heart, that is, of My Body.…
5. But when thine heart hath not been turned aside, O member of Christ, when thy heart
hath not been turned aside “to wicked words, to making excuses in sins, with men that work
in iniquity,” thou shalt also not unite with their elect. For this followeth, “And I will not
unite with their elect.” Who are “their elect”? Those who justify themselves. Who are their
elect? Those “who trust in themselves that they are righteous, and despise others,” as the
Pharisee said in the temple, “Lord, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are.”5768 Who
are their elect? “This Man, if He were a prophet, would know what manner of woman this
is that touched His feet.”5769 Here thou recognisest the words of that other Pharisee, who
invited our Lord to his house; when the woman of that city, who was a sinner, came and
approached His Feet.…
For even this woman herself, “if her heart had turned aside to wicked words,” would
not have lacked wherewith to defend her sins. Do not women daily, her equals in defilement,
but not her equals in confession, harlots, adulteresses, doers of shameful deeds, defend their
sins? If they have not been seen, they deny them: if they have been caught and convicted,
or have done their deeds openly, they defend them. And how easy is their defence, how
ready, yet how headlong; how common, yet how blasphemous! “Had God not willed it, I
had not done it: God willed it: fortune willed it: fate willed it.”…These are the defences of
“the elect” of this world. But let the members of Christ, the Body of Christ, say, let Christ
say in the name of His Body, “Turn not Thou aside, My Heart, to wicked words,” etc., “and
I will not unite with their elect.”…
6. “With men that work wickedness.” What wickedness? Let me mention some sinful
wickedness of theirs. Let me tell you one open sinful wickedness, which they acknowledge.
They say, it is better for a man to be an usurer than a husbandman. Thou askest the reason,
and they assign one.…He vexeth the members of Christ, who cleanseth the earth with a
furrow: he vexeth the members of Christ, who pulleth grass from the earth: he vexeth the
members of Christ, who plucketh an apple from a tree. To avoid committing their imaginary
murders in the farm, he committeth real murders in usury. He dealeth no bread to the needy.
See whether there can be greater unrighteousness than this righteousness.5770 He dealeth
not bread to the hungry. Thou askest, wherefore? Lest the beggar receive the life which is
5768 Luke xviii. 11.
5769 Luke vii. 39.
5770 i.e. as they consider it.
Psalm CXLI
in the bread, which they call a member of God, the substance of God, and bind it in flesh.
What then do ye? why do ye eat? Have ye not flesh? Yes; but we, they say, forasmuch as we
are enlightened by faith in Manes,5771 by our prayers and our Psalms, forasmuch as we are
elect, we cleanse thereby that bread, and transmit it into the treasure-house of the heavens.
Such are the elect, that they are not to be saved by God, but saviours of God. And this is
Christ, they say, crucified in the whole universe. I received in the Gospel Christ a Saviour,
but ye are in your books the saviours of Christ. Plainly ye are blasphemers of Christ, and
therefore not to be saved by Christ. Therefore lest a crumb be given to the hungry, and in
the crumb a member of Christ suffer, is the hungry to die of hunger? False mercy to a crumb
causeth true murder of a man. But who are their elect? “Turn not thou aside, my heart, to
wicked words, and I will not unite with their elect.”
7. “The righteous One shall amend me in mercy, and convict me” (ver. 5). Behold the
sinner confessing. He desireth to be amended in mercy, rather than praised deceit-
fully.…“Shall convict me,” but “in mercy:” shall convict, yet hateth not: yea, shall all the
more convict, because He hateth not. And why doth he therefore give thanks? Because,
“rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.”5772 “The righteous One shall amend me.” Because
He persecuteth thee? God forbid. He requireth rather amending himself, who amendeth in
hate. Wherefore then doth He amend? “In mercy. And shall convict me.” Wherein? “In
mercy. For the oil of a sinner shall not enrich my head.” My head shall not grow by flattery.
Undue praise is flattery: undue praise of a flatterer is “the oil of a sinner.” Therefore men
too, when they have mocked any one with false praise, say, “I have anointed his head.” Love
then to be “convicted by the righteous One in mercy;” love not to be praised by a sinner in
mockery. Have oil in yourselves, and ye shall not seek the “oil of a sinner.”5773…
8. Thou sayest to me, What am I doing? I am beset with flatterers; they cease not to be-
siege me; they praise in me what I would not, that praise in me what I hold in little esteem;
what I hold dear they blame in me; flatterers, treacherous, deceivers. For instance, “Gaiusei-
us5774 is a great man, great, learned, wise; but why is he a Christian? For great is his learning,
great his reading, great his wisdom.” If great is his wisdom, approve of his being a Christian;
if great his learning, learnedly hath he chosen. In fine, what thou revilest, that pleaseth him

5774 This is probably taken from Tertullian, Apol. c. 3: “What when the generality run upon an hatred of
this name with eyes so closed, that, in bearing favourable testimony to any one, they mingle with it the reproach
of the name. ‘A good man Cais Seius, only he is a Christian.’ So another, ‘I marvel that that wise man Lucius
Titius hath suddenly become a Christian.’ No one reflected whether Caius be not therefore good and Lucius
wise, because a Christian, or therefore a Christian because wise and good.” [See A.N.F. vol. iii. p. 20.—C.]
Psalm CXLI
whom thou praisest. But what? That praise sweeteneth not: it is “the oil of a sinner.” Yet
ceaseth he not to speak so. Let him not therewith “fatten thy head;” that is, rejoice not in
such things; agree not to such things; consent not to such things; rejoice not in such things;
and then, if he have applied to thee the oil of flattery, yet hath thy head remained as it was,
it has not been puffed up, it hath not swollen.…“For still shall My word be well-pleasing to
them.” Wait awhile: now they revile Me, saith Christ. In the early times of the Christians,
the Christians were blamed on all sides. Wait as yet; and “My word shall be well-pleasing
to them.” The time shall come when they shall conquer thousands of men, who shall beat
their breasts, and say, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” Even now, how
many remain who blush to beat their breasts? Let them then blame us: let us bear it. Let
them blame; let them hate, accuse, detract; “still shall My word be well-pleasing to them;”
the time shall come when My word shall please them.…O wordy defence of iniquity! Verily
now whole nations say this, and the thunder of nations beating their breasts ceaseth not.
Rightly do the clouds thunder, wherein now God dwelleth. Where is now that wordiness,
where that boasting, “I am righteous; nought of ill have I done”? Verily, when thou hast
contemplated in Holy Scripture the law of righteousness, how far soever thou hast advanced,
thou shalt find thyself a sinner.…What sort of man am I now speaking of, brethren? I speak
of him who worshippeth God alone, who confesseth Christ, who knoweth the Father and
the Son and the Holy Ghost to be one God; who committeth not fornication against Him;
who worshippeth not devils; who seeketh him not aid from the devil; who holdeth the
Catholic Church; whom no one complaineth of as cheating; under whose oppression no
weak neighbour groaneth; who assaileth not another’s wife; who is content with his own,
or even without his own, in such wise as is lawful, and as Apostolical discipline permitteth,
with consent of both, 5775 or when she is not yet married. Even he who is such as this, is yet
overtaken in such things as I have mentioned. For all these daily sins then what is our hope,
save to say with humble heart in the Lord’s Prayer, while we defend not our sins, but confess
them, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;”5776 and to “have an Advocate with
the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,” that He may be “the propitiation for our sins”?5777
See what followeth: “their judges have been swallowed up beside the Rock” (ver. 6). What
is, “swallowed up beside the Rock? That Rock was Christ.5778 They have been swallowed
up beside the Rock.” “Beside,” that is, compared, as judges, as mighty, powerful, learned:
they are called “their judges,” as judging about morals, and laying down their opinions. This
Aristotle said. Set him beside the Rock, and he is swallowed up. Who is Aristotle? let him

Psalm CXLI
hear, “Christ hath said,” and he trembleth among the dead. This Pythagoras said, that Plato
said. Set them beside the Rock, compare their authority to the authority of the Gospel,
compare the proud to the Crucified. Say we to them “Ye have written your words in the
hearts of the proud; He hath planted His Cross in the hearts5779 of kings: finally, He died,
and rose again; ye are dead, and I will not ask how ye rise again.” So “their judges have been
swallowed up beside” that “Rock.” So long do their words seem somewhat, till they are
compared with the Rock. Therefore if any of them be found to have said what Christ too
hath said, we congratulate him, but we follow him not. But he came before Christ. If any
man speak what is true, is he therefore before the Truth itself? Regard Christ, O man, not
when He came to thee, but when He made thee. The sick man too might say, “But I took to
my bed before the physician came to me.” Why, for that very reason has He come last, because
thou first has sickened.
9. “They shall hear My Words, for they have prevailed.” My Words have prevailed over
their words. They have spoken clever things, I true things. To praise one who talketh well
is one thing, to praise One who speaketh truth is another. “They shall hear My Words, for
they have prevailed.” How have they prevailed? Who of them has been taken offering sacrifice,
when such things were forbidden by the law, and has not denied it? Who of them has been
taken worshipping an idol, and has not exclaimed, “I did it not,” and feared lest he should
be convicted? Such servants hath the devil. But how have the Words of the Lord prevailed?
“Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Fear not those who kill the body,”
etc.5780 He gave them fear, He suggested hope, He kindled love. “Fear not death,” He saith.
Do ye fear death? I die first. Fear ye, lest a hair of your head perish? I first rise again in the
flesh uninjured. Rightly have ye heard His Words, for they have prevailed. They spake, and
were slain; they fell, and yet stood. And what was the result of so many deaths of martyrs,
save that those words prevailed, and the earth being, so to speak, watered by the blood of
Christ’s witnesses, the cross of the Church shot up everywhere? How have they “prevailed”?
We have said already, when they were preached by men who feared not. Feared not what?
Neither banishment, nor losses, nor death, nor crucifixion: for it was not death alone that
they did not fear; but even crucifixion, a death than which none was thought more accursed.
It the Lord endured, that His disciples might not only not fear death, but not even that kind
of death. When then these things are said by men that fear not, they have prevailed.
10. What then have all those deaths of the martyrs accomplished? Listen: “As the fatness
of the earth is spread over the earth, our bones have been scattered beside the pit” (ver. 7).
“The bones” of the martyrs, that is, the bodies of the witnesses of Christ. The martyrs were
slain, and they who slew them seemed to prevail. They prevailed by persecution, that the
5779 “On the foreheads,” mss.
5780 Matt. x. 16, 28.
Psalm CXLI
words of Christ might prevail by preaching. And what was the result of the deaths of the
saints? What meaneth, “the fatness of the earth is spread over the earth”? We know that
everything that is refuse is the fatness of the earth. The things which are, as it were, contempt-
ible to men, enrich the earth.…“Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
saints.”5781 As it is contemptible to the world, so is it precious to the husbandman. For he
knoweth the use thereof, and its rich juice; he knoweth what he desireth, what he seeketh,
whence the fertile crop ariseth; but this world despiseth it. Know ye not that “God hath
chosen the contemptible things of the world, and those which are not, like as those which
are, that the things which are may be brought to nought”?5782 From the dunghill was Peter
lifted up, and Paul; when they were put to death, they were despised: now, the earth having
been enriched by them, and the cross of the Church springing up, behold, all that is noble
and chief in the world, even the emperor himself, cometh to Rome, and whither does he
hasten? to the temple of the emperor, or the memorial of the fisherman?
11. “For unto Thee, Lord, are mine eyes; in Thee have I hoped, take not Thou away my
life” (ver. 8). For they were tortured in persecutions, and many failed. It occurreth to him
that many have failed, many have been in hazard, and as it were in the midst of the tribulation
of persecution is sent forth the voice of one praying; “For unto Thee, Lord, are mine eyes:”
I care not what they threaten who stand around, “unto Thee, Lord, are mine eyes.” More
do I fix mine eye on Thy promises than on their threats. I know what Thou hast suffered
for me, what Thou hast promised me.
12. “Keep me from the trap which they have laid for me” (ver. 9). What was the trap?
“If thou consentest, I spare thee.” In the trap was set the bait of the present life; if the bird
love this bait, it falleth into the trap: but if the bird be able to say, “The day of man have I
not desired: Thou knowest:”5783 “He shall pluck his feet out of the net,” etc.5784 Two things
he hath mentioned to be distinguished the one from the other: the trap he said was set by
persecutors; the stumbling-blocks came from those who have consented and apostatised:
and from both he desires to be guarded. On the one side they threaten and rage, on the
other consent and fall: I fear lest the one be such, that I fear him; the other such, that I imitate
him. “This I do to thee, if thou consent not.” “Keep me from the trap,” etc. “Behold, thy
brother hath already consented.” “And from the stumbling-blocks,” etc.
13. “Sinners shall fall into his nets” (ver. 10). Not all sinners, certain sinners, who are
so great sinners, as to love this life to such a degree as to prefer it to everlasting life, “shall
fall into his trap.” But what sayest thou? Shall they that are such, thinkest thou, fall into his

5783 Jer. xvii. 16.

Psalm CXLI
nets? what of Thy disciples, O Christ? Behold, when persecution was raging, when they all
“left Thee alone, and went every one to his own:”5785 lo! they who were closest to Thee, in
Thy trial and persecution, when Thine enemies demanded Thee to be crucified, abandoned
Thee. And that bold one, who had promised Thee that he would go with Thee even unto
death, heard from the Physician what was being done in him, the sick man. For being in a
fever, he had said he was whole; but the Lord touched the vein of his heart. Then came the
trial; then came the test; then came the accusation; and now, questioned not by some great
power, but by a humble slave, and that a woman, questioned by a handmaid, he yielded; he
denied thrice.…“He wept bitterly,” it saith. Not yet was he fitted to suffer. To him was said,
“Thou shalt follow Me afterwards.”5786 Hereafter he was to be firm, having been strengthened
by the Lord’s Resurrection. Not yet then was it time that those “bones” should be “scattered
beside the pit.” For see how many failed, even to those who first hung on His mouth; even
they failed. Wherefore? “I am alone, until I pass over:” for this followeth in the Psalm.…
14. Pascha, as they say who know, and who have explained to us what to read, meaneth
“Passover.” When then the Lord’s Passion was about to come, the Evangelist, as though he
would use this very word, saith, “When the hour was come that Jesus should pass over to
the Father.”5787 We hear then of Pascha in this verse, “I am alone, until I pass over.” After
Pascha I shall no longer be alone, after passing-over I shall no longer be alone. Many shall
imitate Me, many shall follow Me. And if afterward they shall follow, what shall be the case
now? “I am alone, until I pass over.” What is it that the Lord saith in this Psalm, “I am alone,
until I pass over”? What is it that we have expounded? If we have understood it, listen to
His own words in the Gospel. “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
abideth alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.”5788…Therefore He was alone before He
was put to death.…So far was any from dying for the Name, that is, for confessing the Name
of Christ, before that Corn of wheat fell into the ground, that even John, who was slain just
before Him, being given by a wicked king to a dancing woman, was not put to death because
he confessed Christ. Of course he might have been put to death for this, and that by many.
If for another reason he was put to death by one man, how much more might he have been
put to death by those very men, who put Christ to death? For John gave testimony to Christ.
They who heard Christ, wished to slay Him; the man who gave testimony to Him they slew
not.…He is not slain by the Jews who gave free testimony to Christ, whom the Jews slew;
he is slain by Herod, because he said to him, “It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s

wife.”5789 For his brother had not died without issue.5790 For the law of truth, for equity,
for righteousness’ sake, he did die: therefore is he a saint, therefore a martyr; but yet he died
not for that Name whereby we are Christians, wherefore, save that the saying might be ful-
filled, “I am alone, until I pass over.”
5789 Matt. xiv. 4.
5790 [Matt. xxii. 24.—C.]
Psalm CXLI
Psalm CXLII.5791
1. …“With my voice have I cried unto the Lord” (ver. 1). It were enough to say, “with
voice:” not for nothing perhaps has “my” been added. For many cry unto the Lord, not with
their own voice, but with the voice of their body. Let the “inner man” then, in whom “Christ”
hath begun to “dwell by faith,”5792 cry unto the Lord, not with the din of his lips, but with
the affection of his heart. God heareth not, where man heareth: unless thou criest with the
voice of lungs and side and tongue, man heareth thee not: thy thought is thy cry to the Lord.
“With my voice have I prayed unto the Lord.” What he meant by, “I have cried,” he explained
when he said, “I have prayed.” For they too who blaspheme, cry unto the Lord. In the former
part he set down his crying, in the latter he explained what it was. As though it were deman-
ded, With what cry hast thou cried unto the Lord? Unto the Lord, saith he, I have prayed.
My cry is my prayer, not reviling, not murmuring, not blaspheming.
2. “I will pour out before Him my prayer” (ver. 2). What is, “before Him”? In His sight.
What is, in His sight? Where He seeth. But where doth He not see? For so do we say, ‘where
He seeth,’ as though somewhere He seeth not. But in this assemblage of bodily substances
men too see, animals too see: He seeth where man seeth not. For thy thoughts no man seeth,
but God seeth. There then pour out thy prayer, where He alone seeth, who rewardeth. For
the Lord Jesus Christ bade thee pray in secret: but if thou knowest what “thy closet” is, and
cleansest it, there thou prayest to God. “But thou,” saith He, “when thou prayest, enter into
thy closet, and shut the door, and pray to thy Father in secret, and He who seeth in secret
shall reward thee.”5793 If men are to reward thee, pour out thy prayer before men: if God
is to reward thee, pour out thy prayer before Him; and close the door, lest the tempter enter.
Therefore the Apostle, because it is in our power to shut the door, the door of our hearts,
not of our walls, for in it is our “closet,”—because it is in our power to shut this door, saith,
“neither give place to the devil.”5794 But what is to “shut the door”? This door hath as it
were two leaves, desire and fear. Either thou desireth something earthly, and he enters by
this; or thou fearest something earthly, and he enters by that. Close then the door of fear
and desire against the devil, open it to Christ. How dost thou open these folding doors to
Christ? By desiring the kingdom of heaven, by fearing the fire of hell. By desire of this world
the devil entereth, by desire of eternal life Christ entereth; by fear of temporal punishment
the devil entereth, by fear of everlasting fire Christ entereth.…
3. “My tribulation I will proclaim in His sight.” There is a repetition, both in the two
preceding sentences, and in these which follow: the sentiments are two, but both twice ex-

pressed.…For, “in His sight,” is the same as “before Him;” “I will proclaim my tribulation,”
is the same as, “I will pour out my prayer.” When doest thou this? Being set in the midst of
persecution, he saith, “while my spirit failed from me” (ver. 3). Wherefore hath thy spirit
failed, O martyr, set in tribulation? That I may not claim my strength as mine own, that I
may know that Another worketh in me the goodness I have. And men perhaps have heard
that my spirit hath failed within me, and have despaired of me, and have said, “we have
taken him captive, we have overpowered him;” “and Thou hast known my paths.” They
thought me cast down, Thou didst see me standing upright. They who persecuted me and
had seized me, thought my feet entangled, “but their feet were entangled, and they fell, but
we are risen, and stand upright.”5795 For mine eyes are ever unto the Lord, for He shall
pluck my feet out of the net.”5796 I have persevered in walking, for “he that shall persevere
unto the end, the same shall be saved.”5797 They thought me overpowered, but I continued
walking. Where did I walk? In paths which they saw not, who thought me prisoner, in the
paths of Thy righteousness, in the paths of Thy commandments.…For every path is a way,
but not every way is a path. Why then are those ways called paths, save because they are
narrow? Broad is the way of the wicked, narrow the way of the righteous. That which is “the
way” is also “the ways,” just as “the Church” is also “the Churches,” the “heaven” also the
“heavens:” they are spoken of in the plural, they are spoken of also in the singular. On account
of the unity of the Church it is one Church; “My dove is one, she is the only one of her
mother.”5798 On account of the congregation of brethren in various places there are many
Churches. “The Churches of Judæa which are in Christ rejoiced,” saith Paul,5799 “and they
glorified God in me.” Thus he spake of Churches; and of one Church he thus speaketh,
“Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.”…
4. “In this way, wherein I was walking, they hid a trap for me.” This “way wherein I was
walking,” is Christ; there have they laid a trap for me, who persecute me in Christ, for Christ’s
Name’s sake. There then “have they hid for me a trap.” What in me do they hate, what in
me do they persecute? That I am a Christian.…For the heretics too wish to hide a stumbling-
block for us in the Name of Christ, and are themselves deceived. What they think that they
put in the way, they put outside the way, for they themselves are outside the way. They
cannot set a trap where themselves are not.…The Pagan thinketh to put a stumbling-block
in the way, when he saith to me, “Thou worshippest a crucified God.” He findeth fault with
the Cross of Christ, which he understandeth not. He thinketh that he setteth in Christ, what

he setteth near the way. I will not depart from Christ, so shall I not fall from the way into
the trap. Let him mock at Christ crucified, let me see the Cross of Christ on the foreheads
of kings. What he laugheth at, therein am I saved. Nought is prouder than a sick man, who
laugheth at his own medicine. If he laughed not at it, he would take it, and be healed. The
Cross is the sign of humility, but he through excess of pride acknowledgeth not that whereby
may be healed the swelling of his soul. But if I acknowledge, I am walking in the way. So far
am I from blushing at the Cross, that in no secret place do I keep the Cross of Christ, but
bear it on my forehead. Many sacraments we receive, one in one way another in another:
some as ye know we receive with the mouth, some we receive over the whole body. But be-
cause the forehead is the seat of the blush of shame, He who said, “Whosoever shall be
ashamed of Me before men, of him will I be ashamed before My Father which is in heav-
en,”5800 set, so to speak, that very ignominy which the Pagans mock at, in the seat of our
shame. Thou hearest a man assail a shameless man and say, “He hath no forehead.” What
is, “He hath no forehead”? He hath no shame. Let me not have a bare forehead, let the Cross
of my Lord cover it.…
5. “I considered upon the right hand, and saw” (ver. 4). He considered upon the right
hand, and saw: whoso considereth upon the left hand, is blinded. What is to consider on
the right hand? Where they will be to whom shall be said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father,”
etc.,5801…He goeth on to say, “and there was none that knew me.” For when thou fearest
all things, who knoweth what thou regardest, whether thou directest thine eyes to the right
hand or to the left? If, in bearing, thou seekest the praise of men, thou hast regarded the left:
if, in bearing, thou seekest the promises of God, thou hast regarded the right hand. Hast
thou regarded the right hand, thou shalt see: hast thou regarded the left hand, thou shalt be
blinded. But even when thou seest on the right hand, there will be none to know thee. For
who comforteth thee save the Lord? “Flight hath perished from me.” He speaketh as though
he were hemmed in. Let the persecutors rejoice over him; he is overpowered, he is taken,
he is hemmed in, he is conquered. “Flight hath perished” from him who fleeth not. But he
who fleeth not, suffereth whatever he can for Christ: that is, he fleeth not in soul. For in
body it is lawful to flee; it is allowed, it is permitted; for the Lord saith, “When they persecute
you in one city, flee to another.”5802 He then who fleeth not in soul, from him “flight hath
perished.” But it maketh a difference why he fleeth not; whether because he is hemmed in,
because he is caught, or because he is brave. For both from him that is caught flight hath
perished, and from him that is brave flight hath perished. What flight then is to be avoided?
what flight shall we allow to perish from us? That whereof the Lord speaketh in the Gospel,
5800 Luke ix. 26.
5801 Matt. xxv. 34, 41.
5802 Matt. x. 23.
Psalm CXLII
“The Good Shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not
the shepherd, when he seeth the wolf coming, fleeth.” When he seeth the ravager, why fleeth
he? “Because he careth not for the sheep.”5803…In two ways a man’s life is sought, either
by his persecutors or by his lovers.5804 So then “there is none to seek my life,” he said of
them; verily they persecute my life, and they seek not my life. But if they seek my life, they
will find it clinging to Thee: and if they know to seek it, they know also to imitate it.
6. “Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my hope” (ver. 5). When I en-
dured, when I was in tribulation, “I said, Thou art my hope.” My hope here, therefore I en-
dure. But “my portion,” not here, but “in the land of the living.” God giveth a portion in the
land of the living; but not something from Himself without Himself. What will He give to
one that loveth Him, save Himself?
7. “Give heed unto my prayer, for much have I been humbled” (ver. 6). Humbled by
persecutors, humbled in confession. He humbleth himself out of the sight of man: he is
humbled by enemies in their sight. Therefore is he lifted up by Him both visibly and invisibly.
Invisibly are the martyrs already lifted up; visibly shall they be lifted up, “when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption” in the resurrection of the dead; when this very part of him,
against which alone her persecutors could rage, shall be renewed. “Fear not them that kill
the body, but cannot kill the soul.”5805 And what perisheth? what kill they?…Why then art
thou anxious about the rest of thy members, when thou shalt not lose even a hair?5806
“Deliver me from them that persecute me.” From whom thinkest thou that he prayeth to
be delivered? From men who persecuted him? Is it so? are merely men our enemies? We
have other enemies, invisible, who persecute us in another way. Man persecuteth, that he
may slay the body; another persecuteth, that he ensnare the soul.5807…There are then other
enemies of ours too, from whom we ought to pray God to deliver us, lest they lead us astray,
either by crushing us with troubles of this world, or alluring us by its enticements. Who are
these enemies? Let us see whether they are plainly described by any servant of the Lord, by
any soldier, now perfected, who hath engaged with them. Hear the Apostle saying, “We
wrestle not against flesh and blood:”5808 as though he would say, Turn not your hatred
against men; think not them your enemies; think not that it is by their hostility you are being
bruised; these men whom ye fear are flesh and blood.…“For they are strengthened over
me.” Who said, “they are strengthened over me”? The Body of Christ crieth out; it is the

Psalm CXLII
voice of the Church; the members of Christ cry out, “Much hath the number of sinners in-
creased.” “Because iniquity hath abounded, the love of many waxeth cold.” 5809
8. “Bring forth my soul out of prison, that it may confess to Thy Name” (ver. 7). This
“prison” has been variously understood by former writers. And perhaps it is the prison
which is called in the title, “the cave.” For the title of this Psalm runneth thus: “Of under-
standing to David himself, a prayer when he was in the cave.” That which is the cave, the
same is also the prison. Two things have we set before us to understand, but when we have
understood one, both will be understood. A man’s deserts make a prison. For in one dwelling
place one man finds a house, another a prison.…To some then it has seemed that the “cave”
and “prison” are this world; and this the Church prayeth, that it may be brought out of
prison, that is, from this world, from under the sun, where all is vanity.5810 Beyond this
world then God promiseth that we shall be in some sort of rest; therefore perhaps do we cry
concerning this place, “Bring my soul out of prison.” Our soul by faith and hope is in Christ;
“Your life is hid with Christ in God.” But our body is in this prison, in this world.…But
some have said, that this prison and cave is this body, so that this is the meaning of, “Bring
my soul out of prison.” But this interpretation too is somewhat at fault. For what great thing
is it to say, “Bring my soul out of prison,” bring my soul out of the body? Do not the souls
of robbers and wicked men go forth from the body, and go into worse punishment than
here they have endured? What great request then is this, “Bring my soul out of prison,”
when, sooner or later, it must needs come forth? Perhaps the righteous saith, “Let me die
now; bring forth my soul from this prison of the body.” If he be too hasty, he hath not love.
He ought indeed to long for and desire, as the Apostle saith, “having a desire to be dissolved
and to be with Christ, which is far better.” But where is love? Therefore it followeth, “but
to abide in the flesh is needful for you.” Let God then lead us forth from the body, when He
will. Our body too might be said to be a prison, not because that is a prison which God hath
made, but because it is under punishment and liable to death. For there are two things to
be considered in our body, God’s workmanship, and the punishment it has deserved.…Per-
haps then he meant by, “Bring my soul out of prison,” bring my soul out of corruption. If
thus we understand it, it is no blasphemy, the meaning is consistent. Lastly, brethren, as I
think, he meant this; “Bring my soul out of prison,” bring it out of straitness. For to one
who rejoiceth, even a prison is wide; to one in sorrow, a field is strait. Therefore prayeth he
to be brought out of straitness. For though in hope he have enlargement, yet in reality at
present he is straitened.…It is not the body that weigheth down the soul, but the corruptible
body. It is not the body then that maketh the prison, but the corruption. “Bring my soul out
of prison, that it may give thanks to Thy Name.” Now the words which follow seem to come
5809 Matt. xxiv. 12.
5810 Eccles. i. 2, etc.
Psalm CXLII
from the Head, our Lord Jesus Christ. And they are the same as yesterday’s last words.
Yesterday’s last words, if ye remember, were, “I am alone, until I pass over.” And here what
are the last words? “The righteous shall sustain me, until thou recompense me.”
Psalm CXLII
Psalm CXLIII.5811
1. …The title of the Psalm is, “To David himself, when his son was pursuing him.” We
know from the Books of Kings5812 that this happened:…but we must recognise here another
David, truly “strong in hand,” which is the explanation of David, even our Lord Jesus Christ.
For all those events of past time were figures of things to come. Let us seek then in this Psalm
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, announcing Himself beforehand in His prophecy, and
foretelling what should happen at this time by things which were done long ago. For He
Himself foretold Himself in the Prophets: for He is the Word of God. Nor did they say ought
of this kind, save when filled with the Word of God. They announced then Christ, being
filled with Christ,5813 they went before Him about to come, and He deserted not them going
before.…
2. Let then our Lord speak; let Christ with us, whole Christ, speak. “Lord, hear my
prayer, receive with Thine ears my entreaty” (ver. 1). “Hear” and “receive with ears” are the
same thing. It is repetition, it is confirmation. “In Thy truth hear me, in Thy righteousness.”
Take it not without emphasis when it is said, “in Thy righteousness.” For it is a commendation
of grace, that none of us think his righteousness his own. For this is the righteousness of
God, which God hath given thee to possess. For what saith the Apostle of them, who would
boast of their own righteousness? Speaking of the Jews, he saith, “they have a zeal of God,
but not according to knowledge.”5814…Thou art perverse, because thou imputest what thou
hast done ill to God, what well to thyself: thou wilt be right, when thou imputest what thou
hast done ill to thyself, what well to God.…Behold, “in Thy righteousness hear me.” For
when I look upon myself, nought else do I find mine own, save sin.
3. “And enter not into judgment with Thy servant” (ver. 2). Who are willing to enter
into judgment with Him, save they who, “being ignorant of the righteousness of God, go
about to establish their own?” “Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou hast not seen; wherefore
have we afflicted our souls, and Thou takest no knowledge?”5815 As though they would say,
“We have done what Thou hast commanded, wherefore dost Thou not render to us what
Thou hast promised?” God answereth thee: I will give to thee to receive what I have promised:
I have given thee that thou shouldest do that whereby thou mayest receive. Finally, to such
proud ones the Prophet speaketh; “Wherefore will ye plead with Me? ye have all transgressed
against Me, saith the Lord.”5816 Why will ye enter into judgment with Me, and recount your

own righteousnesses?…“For before Thee every one living shall not be justified.” “Every one
living;” living, that is, here, living in the flesh, living in expectation of death; born a man;
deriving his life of man; sprung from Adam, a living Adam; every one thus living may perhaps
be justified before himself, but not before Thee. How before himself? By pleasing himself,
displeasing Thee. Enter not then into judgment with me, O Lord my God. How straight
soever I seem to myself, Thou bringest forth a standard from Thy store-house, Thou fittest
me to it, and I am found crooked. Well is it said, “with Thy servant.” It is unworthy of Thee
to enter into judgment with Thy servant, or even with Thy friend.5817…What of the Apostles
themselves?…That ye may perceive it at once, they learnt to pray what we pray: to them
was given the pattern of prayer by the heavenly Counsellor. “After this manner,” saith He,
“pray ye.”5818 And having set down certain things first, He laid down this too to be said by
the leaders of the sheep, the chief members of the Shepherd and Gatherer5819 of the one
flock; even they learnt to say, “Forgive us our debts.”5820 They said not, “Thanks be to Thee,
who hast forgiven us our debts, as we too forgive our debtors,” but, “Forgive, as we forgive.”
But surely the faithful prayed then, surely the Apostles prayed then, for this Lord’s Prayer
was given rather to the faithful. If those debts only were meant which are forgiven by Baptism,
it would befit catechumens rather to say, “Forgive us our debts.” Let the Apostles then say,
yea let them say, “Forgive us our debts.” And when it is said to them, “Wherefore say ye
this? what are your debts?” let them answer, “for in Thy sight every one living shall not be
justified.”
4. “For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: he hath humbled my life on the earth” (ver.
3). Here we speak, here our Head speaketh for us. Manifestly both the devil persecuted the
Soul of Christ and Judas the Soul of his Master: and now too the same devil remaineth to
persecute the Body of Christ, and one Judas succeedeth another. There lacketh not then of
whom the Body too may say, “For the enemy hath persecuted my soul.” For what doth each
one who persecuteth us endeavour save to make us abandon our heavenly hope, and savour
of the earth, yield to our persecutor, and love earthly things? “They have laid me in dark
places, as the dead of the world.” This ye hear more readily from the Head; this ye perceive
more readily in the Head. For He died indeed for us, yet was He not one of the “dead of the
world.” For who are the “dead of the world”? And how was not He one of the “dead of the
world”? “The dead of the world” are those who have died of their own desert, receiving the
reward of iniquity, deriving death from the sin transmissed to them; according as it is said,
“For I was conceived in iniquity.”5821…In dying, saith He, I do the will of My Father, but I

am not deserving of death. Nought have I done wherefore I should die, yet is it Mine own
doing that I die, that by the death of an innocent One, they may be freed who had wherefore
they should die. “They set me in places,” as though in Hades, as though in the tomb, as
though in His very Passion, “as the dead of the world.”5822
5. “And My Spirit within me,” saith He, “suffered weariness” (ver. 4). Remember, “My
soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.”5823 Here we see one voice. Do we not see
plainly the transition from the Head to the members, from the members to the Head?…
6. But we too were there. He goes to the members. “I have called to mind the days of
old” (ver. 5). Did He “call to mind the days of old,” by whom every day was made? No, but
the body speaketh, each one who has been justified by His grace, who dwelleth in Him in
love and devout humility, speaketh and saith, “I have meditated upon all Thy works:” plainly
because Thou hast made all things good, and nothing would have stood fast, which was not
established by Thee. Thy creation is made a spectacle unto me: I have sought in the work
the Artificer, in all that is made the Maker. Wherefore this, to what purpose this, save that
he might understand, that whatever there was of good in himself was made by Him.…Look
back then upon the Framer of thy life, the Author of thy substance, of thy righteousness,
and of thy salvation: “meditate upon the works of His hands,” for the righteousness too
which is in thee, thou wilt find to pertain to His hand. Hear the Apostle teaching thee this,
“not of works,” he saith, “lest any should boast.” Have we no good works? Plainly we have:
but see what follows; “for we are His workmanship,”5824 saith he. “We are His workmanship:”
perhaps in thus speaking of workmanship, he meant to mention the nature whereby we are
men? Evidently not: he was speaking of works. But let us not make conjectures; let the text
go on, “for we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.” Think not
then that thou thyself doest anything, save in so far as thou art evil.…“Work out your own
salvation,” saith the Apostle, “with fear and trembling.” 5825 If we do work out our own
salvation, wherefore with fear, wherefore with trembling, when what we work is in our own
power? Hear wherefore with fear and trembling: “for it is God that worketh in you both to
will and to do, of His good pleasure.” Therefore “with fear and trembling,” that it may delight
our Maker to work in the lowly valley.…
7. “I stretched forth,” saith he, “my hands to Thee: my soul is as a land without water
to Thee” (ver. 6). Rain upon me, saith he, to bring forth from me good fruit. “For the Lord
shall give sweetness, that our land may give her fruit.”5826 “I have stretched forth my hands

Psalm CXLIII
to Thee; my soul is as a land without water,” not to me, but “to Thee.” I can thirst for Thee,
I cannot water myself.
8. “Speedily hear me, Lord” (ver. 7). For what need of delay to inflame my thirst, when
already I thirst so eagerly? Thou didst delay the rain, that I might drink and imbibe, not reject,
Thy inflowing. If then Thou didst for this cause delay, now give; for “my spirit hath failed.”
Let Thy Spirit fill me. This is the reason why Thou shouldest speedily hear me. I am now
become “poor in spirit,” make Thou me “blessed in the kingdom of heaven.”5827 For he in
whom his own spirit liveth, is proud, is puffed up with his own spirit against God.…
9. “Turn not Thou away Thy Face from me.” Thou didst turn it away from me when
proud. For once I was full, and in my fulness I was puffed up. Once “in my fulness I said, I
shall never be moved.” “I said in my fulness, I shall not be moved,” knowing not Thy
Righteousness, and establishing mine own; but “Thou, Lord, in Thy Will hast afforded
strength to my beauty.” “I said in my fulness, I shall not be moved,” but from Thee came
whatever fulness I had. And to prove to me that it was from Thee, “Thou didst turn away
Thy Face from me, and I was troubled.”5828 After this trouble, where into I was cast, because
Thou didst turn away Thy Face, after the weariness of my spirit, after my heart was troubled
within me, because Thou didst turn away Thy Face, then became I “like a land without water
to Thee: turn not Thou away Thy Face.” Thou turnedst it away from me when proud; give
it back to me now I am humble. Because, if Thou turn it away, “I shall be like to them that
go down into the pit.” What is, “that go down into the pit”? When the sinner has come into
the depth of sins, he will show contempt. They “go down into the pit,” who lose even con-
fession; against which is said, “Let not the pit close her mouth over me.”5829 This depth
Scripture calleth mostly “a pit,” into which depth when a sinner hath come, “he showeth
contempt.” What is, “he showeth contempt”? He no longer believeth in Providence, or if
he do believe, he thinketh that he has no longer aught to do with it.…
10. “Make me to hear in the morning Thy mercy, for in Thee have I hoped” (ver. 8).
Behold, I am in the night, yet “in Thee have I hoped,” until the iniquity of the night pass
away. “For we have,” as Peter saith, “a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
daystar arise in your hearts.” “Morning” then he calleth the time after the end of the world,
when we shall see what in this world we believe. But what here, until the morning come?
For it is not enough to hope for the morning; we must do somewhat. Why do somewhat?
God is to be sought with the hands in the night. What is, “with the hands”? By good works.
Since then we must thus hope for the morning, and bear this night, and persevere in this
5827 Matt. v. 3.
5828 Ps. xxx. 6, 7.
5829 Ps. lxix. 15.
Psalm CXLIII
patience until the day dawn, what meanwhile must we do here? lest perchance thou think
that thou wilt do aught of thyself, whereby thou mayest earn to be brought to the morning.
“Make known to me, O Lord, the way wherein I must walk.” Therefore did He kindle the
lamp of prophecy, therefore did He send the Lord in the vessel,5830 as it were, of the flesh,
who should even say, “My strength is dried up like a potsherd.”5831 Walk by prophecy, walk
by the lamp of future things predicted, walk by the word of God.…
11. “Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord, for unto Thee have I fled for refuge” (ver.
9). I who once fled from Thee, now flee to Thee. For Adam fled from the Face of God, and
hid himself among the trees of Paradise, so that of him was said in the Book of Job, “As a
servant that fleeth from his Lord, and findeth a shadow.”5832 He fled from the Face of his
Lord, and found a shadow. Woe to him, if he continue in the shade, lest it be said afterward,
“All things are passed away like a shadow.”5833 The rulers of this world, of this darkness,
the rulers of the wicked; against these ye wrestle. Great is your conflict, not to see your en-
emies, and yet to conquer. Against the rulers of this world, of this darkness, the devil, that
is, and his angels; not the rulers of that world, whereof is said, “the world was made by Him,”
but that world whereof is said, “the world knew Him not.”5834 “For unto Thee have I fled
for refuge.”…Whither should I flee? “Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?”5835
12. “Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God” (ver. 10). Glorious confession!
glorious rule! “For Thou,” saith he, “art my God.” To another will I hasten to be re-made,
if by another I was made. Thou art my all, “for Thou art my God.” Shall I seek a father to
get an inheritance? “Thou art my God,” not only the Giver of mine inheritance, but mine
Inheritance itself. “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.”5836 Shall I seek a patron,
to obtain redemption? “Thou art my God.” Lastly, having been created, do I desire to be re-
created? “Thou art my God,” my Creator, who hast created me by Thy Word, and re-created
me by Thy Word. “Teach Thou me:” for it cannot be that Thou art my God, and yet I am
to be mine own master. See how grace is commended to us. This hold fast, this drink in,
this let none drive out of your hearts, lest ye have “a zeal, of God, but not according to
knowledge.”5837 Say then this: “Thy good Spirit,” not my bad one, “Thy good Spirit shall
lead me into the right land.” For my bad spirit hath led me into a crooked land. And what

have I deserved? What can be reckoned as my good works without Thy aid, through which
I might obtain and be worthy to be led by Thy Spirit into the right land?
13. Listen, then, with all your power, to the commendation of Grace, whereby ye are
saved without price. “For Thy Name’s sake, O Lord, Thou shalt quicken me in Thy right-
eousness” (ver. 11); not in mine own: not because I have deserved, but because Thou hast
mercy. For were I to show mine own desert, nought should I deserve of Thee, save punish-
ment. Thou hast pruned off from me mine own merits; Thou hast grafted in Thine own
gifts. “Thou shalt bring forth my soul out of tribulation.” “And in thy mercy shalt bring
mine enemies to destruction: and thou shalt destroy all them that afflict my soul; for I am
Thy servant” (ver. 12).
Psalm CXLIII
Psalm CXLIV.5838
1. The title of this Psalm is brief in number of words, but heavy in the weight of its
mysteries. “To David himself against Goliath.” This battle was fought in the time of our
fathers, and ye, beloved, remember it with me from Holy Scripture.…David put five stones
in his scrip, he hurled but one. The five Books were chosen, but unity conquered. Then,
having smitten and overthrown him, he took the enemy’s sword, and with it cut off his head.
This our David also did, He overthrew the devil with his own weapons: and when his great
ones, whom he had in his power, by means of whom he slew other souls, believe, they turn
their tongues against the devil, and so Goliath’s head is cut off with his own sword.
2. “Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands for battle, my fingers for war”
(ver. 1). These are our words, if we be the Body of Christ. It seems a repetition of sentiment;
“our hands for battle,” and “our fingers for war,” are the same. Or is there some difference
between “hands” and “fingers”? Certainly both hands and fingers work. Not then without
reason do we take “fingers” as put for “hands.” But still in the “fingers” we recognise the
division of operation, yet still a sort of unity. Behold that grace! the Apostle saith,5839 To
one, this; to another, that; “there are diversities of operations; all these worketh one and the
self-same Spirit;” there is the root of unity. With these “fingers” then the Body of Christ
fighteth, going forth to “war,” going forth to “battle.”…By works of Mercy our enemy is
conquered, and we could not have works of mercy unless we had charity, and charity we
could have none unless we received it by the Holy Ghost; He then “teacheth our hands for
battle, and our fingers for war:” to Him rightfully do we say, “My Mercy,” from whom we
have also that we are merciful: “for he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed
no mercy.”5840
3. My Mercy and my Refuge, my Upholder and my Deliverer” (ver. 2). Much toileth
this combatant, having his flesh lusting against his spirit. Keep what thou hast. Then shalt
thou have in full what thou wishest, when “death shall have been swallowed up in victory;”5841
when this mortal body has been raised, and is changed into the condition of the angels, and
rises aloft to a heavenly quality.…There is life, there are good days, where nought lusteth
against the spirit, where it is not said, “Fight,” but “Rejoice.” But who is he that lusteth for
these days? Every man certainly saith, “I do.” Hear what followeth. I see that thou art toiling,
I see that thou art engaged in battle, and in danger; hear what followeth:…“Depart from

evil, and do good:” let not the poor first weep under thee, that the poor may rejoice through
thee. For what reward, since now thou art fighting? “Seek peace, and ensue it.” Learn and
say, “My Mercy and my Refuge, mine Upholder and my Deliverer, my Protector:” “mine
Upholder,” lest I fall; “my Deliverer,” lest I stick; “my Protector,” lest I be stricken. In all
these things, in all my toil, in all my battles, in all my difficulties, in Him have I hoped, “who
subdueth my people under me.” Behold, our Head speaketh together with us.
4. “Lord, what is man, that Thou hast become known unto him?” (ver. 3). All is included
in “that Thou hast become known unto him.” “Or the son of man, that Thou valuest him?”
Thou valuest him, that is, Thou makest him of such importance, Thou countest him of such
price, Thou knowest under what Thou placest him, over what Thou placest him. For valuing
is considering the price of a thing. How greatly did He value man, who for him shed the
blood of His only-begotten Son! For God valueth not man in the same way as one man
valueth another: he, when he findeth a slave for sale, giveth a higher price for a horse than
for a man. Consider how greatly He valued thee, that thou mayest be able to say, “If God
be for us, who can be against us?” And how greatly did He value thee, “who spared not His
own Son”? “How shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?”5842 He who giveth
this food to the combatant, what keepeth He in store for the conqueror?…
5. “Man is made like unto vanity: his days pass away like a shadow” (ver. 4). What vanity?
Time, which passeth on, and floweth by. For this “vanity” is said in comparison of the Truth,
which ever abideth, and never faileth: for it too is a work of His Hand, in its degree. “For,”
as it is written, “God filled the earth with His good things.”5843 What is “His”? That accord
with Him. But all these things, being earthly, fleeting, transitory, if they be compared to that
Truth, where it is said, “I Am That I Am,”5844 all this which passeth away is called “vanity.”
For through time it vanisheth, like stroke into the air. And why should I say more than that
which the Apostle James said, willing to bring down proud men to humility, “What is,” saith
he, “your life? It is even a vapour, which appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth
away.”5845…Work then, though it be in the night, with thine hands, that is, by good works
seek God, before the day come which shall gladden thee, lest the day come which shall sadden
thee. For see how safely thou workest, who art not left by Him whom thou seekest; “that
thy Father which seeth in secret may reward thee openly.”5846…

Thou shalt confound them” (ver. 6). “Send forth Thy Hand from above, and deliver me,
and draw me out of many waters” (ver. 7). The Body of Christ, the humble David, full of
grace, relying on God, fighting in this world, calleth for the help of God. What are “heavens
bowed down”? Apostles humbled. For those “heavens declare the glory of God;” and of
these heavens declaring the glory of God it is presently said, “There is neither speech nor
language, but their voices are heard among them,” etc.5847 When then these heavens sent
forth their voices through all lands, and did wonderful things, while the Lord flashed and
thundered from them by miracles and commandments, the gods were thought to have come
down from heaven to men. For certain of the Gentiles, thinking this, desired even to sacrifice
to them.…But they commended to these the Lord Jesus Christ, humbling themselves, that
God might be praised; because “the heavens” were “bowed,” that “God” might “come
down.”…“Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.” So long as they are not touched,
they seem to themselves great: they are now about to say, “Great art Thou, O Lord:”5848 the
mountains also are about to say, “Thou only art the Most Highest over all the earth.”5849
7. But there are some that conspire, that “gather themselves together against the Lord,
and against His Christ.”5850 They have come together, they have conspired. “Flash forth
Thy lightnings, and Thou shalt scatter them.” Abound with Thy miracles, and their conspir-
acy shall be broken.…“Send forth Thine arrows, and Thou shalt confound them.” Let the
unsound be wounded, that, being well wounded, they may be made sound; and let them
say, being set now in the Church, in the Body of Christ, let them say with the Church, “I am
wounded with Love.”5851 “Send forth Thine Hand from on high.” What afterward? What
in the end? How conquereth the Body of Christ? By heavenly aid. “For the Lord Himself
shall come with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God shall He descend
from heaven,”5852 Himself the Saviour of the body, the Hand of God. What is, “Out of many
waters”? From many peoples. What peoples? Aliens, unbelievers, whether assailing us from
without, or laying snares within. Take me out of many waters, in which Thou didst discipline
me, in which Thou didst roll me, to free me from my filth. This is the “water of contradic-
tion.”5853…“From the hand of strange children.” Hear, brethren, among whom we are,
among whom we live, from whom we long to be delivered. “Whose mouth hath spoken
vanity” (ver. 8). All of you to-day, if ye had not gathered yourselves together to these divine

shows5854 of the word of God, and were not at this hour engaged in them, how great vanities
would ye be hearing! “whose mouth hath spoken vanity:” when, in short, would they,
speaking vanity, hear you speaking vanity? “And their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.”
What doest thou among them with thy pastoral scrip with five stones in it? Say it to me in
another form: that same law which thou hast signified by five stones, signify in some other
way also. “I will sing a new song unto Thee, O God” (ver. 9). “A new song” is of grace; “a
new song” is of the new man; “a new song” is of the New Testament. But lest thou shouldest
think that grace departeth from the law, whereas rather by grace the law is fulfilled, “upon
a psaltery of ten strings will I sing unto Thee.” Upon the law of ten commandments: therein
may I sing to Thee; therein may I rejoice to Thee; therein may “I sing to Thee a new song;”
for, “Love is the fulfilling of the law.” 5855 But they who have not love may carry the psaltery,
sing they cannot. Contradiction cannot make my psaltery to be silent.
8. “Who giveth salvation to kings, who redeemeth David His servant” (ver. 10). Ye know
who David is; be yourselves David. Whence “redeemeth He David His servant”? Whence
redeemeth He Christ? Whence redeemeth He the Body of Christ? “From the sword of ill
intent deliver me.” “From the sword” is not sufficient; he addeth, “of ill intent.” Without
doubt there is a sword of good intent. What is the sword of good intent? That whereof the
Lord saith, “I came not to send peace on earth, but a sword.” 5856 For He was about to sep-
arate believers from unbelievers, sons from parents, and to sever all other ties, while the
sword cut off what was diseased, but healed the members of Christ. Of good intent then is
the sword twice sharpened, powerful with both edges, the Old and New Testaments, with
the narration of the past and the promise of the future. That then is the sword of good intent:
but the other is of ill intent, wherewith they talk vanity, for that is of good intent, wherewith
God speaketh verity. For truly “the sons of men have teeth which are spears and arrows,
and their tongue is a sharp sword.”5857 “From” this “sword deliver me” (ver. 11). “And take
me out of the hand of strange children, whose mouth hath spoken vanity:” just as before.
And that which followeth, “their right hand is a right hand of iniquity,” the same he had set
down before also, when he called them “many waters.” For lest thou shouldest think that
the “many waters” were good waters, he explained them by the “sword of ill intent.”
9. “Whose sons are like young vines firmly planted in their youth” (ver. 12). He wisheth
to recount their happiness. Observe, ye sons of light, sons of peace: observe, ye sons of the
Church, members of Christ; observe whom he calleth “strangers,” whom he calleth “strange
children,” whom he calleth “waters of contradiction,” whom he calleth a “sword of ill intent.”

Psalm CXLIV
Observe, I beseech you, for among them ye are in peril, among their tongues ye fight against
the desires of your flesh, among their tongues, set in the hand of the devil wherewith he
fighteth.5858…What vanity hath their mouth spoken, and how is their right hand a right
hand of iniquity? “Their daughters are fitted and adorned after the similitude of a temple.”
“Their garners are full, bursting out from one store to another: their sheep are fruitful,
multiplying in their streets” (ver. 13): “their oxen are fat: their hedge is not broken down,
nor their road, nor is their crying in their streets” (ver. 14). Is not this then happiness? I ask
the sons of the kingdom of heaven, I ask the offspring of everlasting resurrection, I ask the
body of Christ, the members of Christ, the temple of God. Is not this then happiness, to
have sons safe, daughters beautiful, garners full, cattle abundant, no downfall, I say not of
a wall, but not even of a hedge, no tumult and clamour in the streets, but quiet, peace,
abundance, plenty of all things in their houses and in their cities? Is not this then happiness?
or ought the righteous to shun it? or findest thou not the house of the righteous too
abounding with all these things, full of this happiness? Did not Abraham’s house abound
with gold, silver, children, servants, cattle? What say we? is not this happiness? Be it so, still
it is on the left hand. What is, on the left hand? Temporal, mortal, bodily. I desire not that
thou shun it, but that thou think it not to be on the right hand.…For what ought they to
have set on the right hand? God, eternity, the years of God which fail not, whereof is said,
“and Thy years shall not fail.”5859 There should be the right hand, there should be our
longing. Let us use the left for the time, let us long for the fight for eternity. “If riches increase,
set not your heart upon them.”5860…
10. “They have called the people blessed who have these things” (ver. 15). O men that
speak vanity! They have lost the true right hand, wicked and perverse, they have put on the
benefits of God inversely. O wicked ones, O speakers of vanity, O strange children! What
was on the left hand, they have set on the right. What dost thou, David? What dost thou,
Body of Christ? What do ye, members of Christ? What do ye, not strange children, but
children of God?…What say ye? Say ye with us, “Blessed is the people whose Lord is their
God.”

Psalm CXLIV
Psalm CXLV.5861
1. …The title is, “Praise, to David himself.” Praise to Christ Himself. And since He is
called David, who came to us of the seed of David, yet He was our King, ruling us, and
bringing us into His kingdom, therefore “Praise to David himself” is understood to mean,
Praise to Christ Himself. Christ according to the flesh is David, because He is the Son of
David: but according to His Divine Nature He is the Creator of David, and Lord of David.
“I will exalt Thee, my God, my King; and I will bless Thy Name for the age, and age upon
age” (ver. 1). Ye see that the praise of God is here begun, and this praise is carried on even
to the end of the Psalm.…Now then begin to praise, if thou intendest to praise for ever. He
who will not praise in this transitory “age,” will be silent when “age upon age” has come.
But lest any one should in any otherwise also understand what he saith, “I will praise Thy
Name for the age,” and should seek another age, wherein to praise, he saith, “Every day will
I bless Thee” (ver. 2). Praise then and bless the Lord thy God every day, that when single
days have passed, and there has come one day without end, thou mayest go from praise to
praise, as “from strength to strength.”5862 No day shall pass by, wherein I bless Thee not.
And it is no wonder, if in thy day of joy thou bless the Lord. What if perchance some day
of sorrow hath dawned on thee, as is natural in the circumstances of our mortal nature, as
there is abundance of offences, as temptations are multiplied; what, if something sad befall
thee, a man; wilt thou cease to praise God? wilt thou cease to bless thy Creator? If thou cease,
thou hast lied in saying, “every day,” etc. But if thou cease not, although it seem to thee to
be ill with thee in the day of thy sorrow, yet in thy God it shall be well with thee.…
2. “Great is the Lord, and very much to be praised” (ver. 3). How much was he about
to say? what terms was he about to seek? How vast a conception hath he included in the one
word, “very much”? Imagine what thou wilt, for how can that be imagined, which cannot
be contained? “He is very much to be praised. And of His Greatness there is no end;”
therefore said he “very much:” lest perchance thou begin to wish to praise, and think that
thou canst reach the end of His praises, whose Greatness can have no end. Think not then
that He, whose Greatness has no end, can ever be enough praised by thee. Is it not then
better that as He has no end, so neither should thy praise have end? His Greatness is without
end; let thy praise also be without end.…
3. For how great things besides has His boundless Goodness and illimitable Greatness
made, which we do not know! When we lift the gaze of our eyes even to the heaven, and
then recall it from sun, moon, and stars to the earth, and there is all this space where our
sight can wander; beyond the heavens who can extend the eyesight of his mind, not to say
of his flesh? So far then as His works are known to us, let us praise Him through His works.
5861 Lat. CXLIV. Sermon to the people.
5862 Ps. lxxxiv. 7.
Psalm CXLV
Psalm CXLV
5863 “Generation and generation shall praise Thy works” (ver. 4). Every generation shall
praise Thy works. For perhaps every generation is meant by “generation and genera-
tion.”…Did he perchance mean to imply two generations by that repetition? For we are in
this generation sons of God, we shall be in another generation sons of the Resurrection.
Scripture hath called us “sons of the Resurrection;” the Resurrection itself it hath called
Regeneration. “In the regeneration,” it saith, “when the Son of Man shall be seated in His
Majesty.”5864 So also in another place; “For they shall not marry, nor be given in marriage,
for they are the sons of the Resurrection.”5865 Therefore “generation and generation shall
praise Thy works.…And they shall tell out Thine excellence.” For neither shall they praise
Thy works, save in order to “tell out Thine excellence.” Boys at school are set to praise, and
all such things are set before them to be praised, as God hath wrought: a mortal is set to
praise the sun, the sky, the earth; to come to even lesser things, to praise a rose, or a laurel;
all these are works of God: they are set, they are undertaken, they are praised: the works are
lauded, of the Worker they are silent. I desire in the works to praise the Creator: I love not
a thankless praiser. Dost thou praise what He hath made, and art silent of Him who made?
In that which thou seest, what is it that thou praisest? The form, the usefulness, some virtue,
some power in the things. If beauty delight thee, what is more beautiful than the Maker? If
usefulness be praised, what more useful than He who made all things? If excellence be
praised, what more excellent than He by whom all things were made?…
4. “They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of Thy Holiness, and shall record
Thy wondrous deeds” (ver. 5). “And the excellence of Thy fearful works shall they speak of:
and Thy greatness, they shall relate it” (ver. 6). “The remembrance of the abundance of Thy
sweetness they shall pour forth” (ver. 7): none but Thine. See whether this man, meditating
on Thy works, hath turned aside from the Worker to the work: see whether he hath sunk
from Him who made, to the things which He made. Of the things which He hath made, he
hath made a step up to Him, not a descent from Him to them. For if thou love these more
than Him, thou wilt not have Him. And what profit is it to thee to overflow with the works,
if the Worker leave thee? Truly thou shouldest love them; but love Him more, and love them
for His sake. For He doth not hold out promises, without holding out threats also: if He
held out no promises, there would be no encouragement; if He held out no threats, there
would be no correction. They that praise Thee therefore shall “speak” also “of the excellence
of Thy terrible deeds;” the excellence of that work of Thy hands which punisheth and ad-
ministereth discipline, they shall speak of, they shall not be silent: for they shall not proclaim
Thine everlasting kingdom, and be silent about Thine everlasting fire. For the praise of God,

5864 Matt. xix. 28.
5865 Luke xx. 35, 36.
Psalm CXLV
setting thee in the way, ought to show thee both what thou shouldest love, and what thou
shouldest fear; what thou shouldest seek, and what thou shouldest shun; what thou
shouldest choose, and what thou shouldest avoid. The time of choice is now, the time of
receiving will be hereafter. Let then the excellence of Thy terrible things be told. Unlimited
as it is, though “of Thy greatness there is no end,” they shall not be silent about it. How shall
they recount it, if there is no end of it? They shall recount it when they praise it; and because
there is no end of it, so of His praise also there shall be no end.5866
5. “The remembrance of the abundance of Thy sweetness they shall pour forth.” O happy
feasts! What shall they eat, who thus shall “pour forth”!…So eat, that thou mayest pour
forth again; so receive, that thou mayest give. Thou eatest, when thou learnest; thou pourest
forth again, when thou teachest: thou eatest, when thou hearest; thou pourest forth again,
when thou preachest; but that thou pourest forth, which thou hast first eaten. Finally, that
most eager feaster John, to whom the very table of the Lord sufficed not, unless he leaned
on the Lord’s breast, and of his inmost heart drank in divine secrets; what did he pour forth?
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.”5867 How is it that it sufficeth
not to say, “Thy remembrance;” or, “the remembrance of Thine abundance”? Because, what
availeth it if it be abundant, yet not sweet? So also it is annoying if it be sweet but too little.
6. …By “pouring forth” this, His preachers “shall exult in His righteousness” not in
their own. What then hast Thou done unto us, O Lord, whom we praise, that we should be,
that we should praise, that we should “exult in Thy righteousness,” that we should “utter
forth the remembrance of the abundance of Thy sweetness”? Let us tell it, and, as we tell,
let us praise.
7. “Merciful and pitiful is the Lord; long-suffering, and very merciful” (ver. 8). “Sweet
is the Lord to all, and His compassions reach into all His works” (ver. 9). Were He not such
as this, there would be no seeking to recover us. Consider thyself: what didst thou deserve,
O sinner? Despiser of God, what didst thou deserve? See if aught occur to thee but penalty,
if aught occur to thee but punishment. Thou seest then what was due to thee, and what He
hath given, who gave gratis. There was given pardon to the sinner; there was given the
spirit of justification; there was given charity and love, wherein thou mayest do all good
works; and beyond this, He will give thee also life everlasting, and fellowship with the angels:
all of His mercy.…Hear the Scripture: “I will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should turn, and live.” 5868 By these words of God, he is brought back to hope; but there is
another snare to be feared, lest through this very hope he sin the more. What then didst
thou also say, thou who through hope sinnest yet more? “Whensoever I turn, God will forgive
5866 Ps. lxxxiv. 4.
5867 John i. 1.
5868 Ezek. xxxiii. 11.
Psalm CXLV
me all; I will do whatsoever I will.” Say not then, “To-morrow I will turn, to-morrow I will
please God; and all to-day’s and yesterday’s deeds shall be forgiven me.” Thou sayest true:
God hath promised pardon to thy conversion; He hath not promised a to-morrow to thy
delay.5869
8. “Sweet is the Lord to all, and His compassions are over all His works.” Why then doth
He condemn? why doth He scourge? Are not they whom He condemneth, whom He
scourgeth, His works? Plainly they are. And wilt thou know how “His compassions are over
all His works”? Thence is that long-suffering, whereby “He maketh His sun to rise on the
evil and on the good.”5870 Are not “His compassions over all His works, who sendeth rain
upon the just and upon the unjust”? In His long-suffering He waiteth for the sinner, saying,
“Turn ye to Me, and I will turn to you.”5871 Are not “His compassions over all His works”?
And when He saith, “Go ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,”5872
this is not His compassion, but His severity. His compassion is given to His works: His
severity is not over His works, but over thy works. Lastly, if thou remove thine own evil
works, and there remain in thee nought but His work, His compassion will not leave thee:
but if thou leavest not thy works, there will be severity over thy works, not over His works.
9. “Let all Thy works, O Lord, confess to Thee, and let Thy saints bless Thee” (ver. 10).
How so? Is not the earth His work? Are not the trees His work? Cattle, beasts, fish, fowl, are
not they His works? Plainly they too are. And how shall these too confess to Him? I see indeed
in the angels that His works confess to Him, for the angels are His works: and men are His
works; and when men confess to Him, His works confess to Him; but have trees and stones
the voice of confession? Yes, verily; “let all” His “works confess to” Him. What sayest thou?
even the earth and the trees?…But there ariseth the same question in regard of praise, as in
regard of confession. For if earth and all things devoid of sensation therefore cannot confess,
because they have no voice to confess with; neither will they be able to praise, because they
have no voice to proclaim with. But do not those Three Children enumerate all things, as
they walked amid the harmless flames, who had leisure not only not to fear, but even to
praise God? They say to all things, heavenly and earthly, “Bless ye the Lord, praise Him and
magnify Him for ever.”5873 Behold how they praise. Let none think that the dumb stone or
dumb animal hath reason wherewith to comprehend God. They who have thought this,
have erred far from the truth. God hath ordered everything, and made everything: to some
He hath given sense and understanding and immortality, as to the angels; to some He hath

Psalm CXLV
given sense and understanding with mortality, as to man; to some He hath given bodily
sense, yet gave them not understanding, or immortality, as to cattle: to some He hath given
neither sense, nor understanding, nor immortality, as to herbs, trees, stones: yet even these
cannot be wanting in their kind, and by certain degrees He hath ordered His creation, from
earth up to heaven, from visible to invisible, from mortal to immortal. This framework of
creation, this most perfectly ordered beauty, ascending from lowest to highest, descending
from highest to lowest, never broken, but tempered together of things unlike, all praiseth
God. Wherefore then doth all praise God? Because when thou considerest it, and seest its
beauty, thou in it praisest God. The beauty of the earth is a kind of voice of the dumb
earth.…And this which thou hast found in it, is the very voice of its confession, that thou
praise the Creator. When thou hast thought on the universal beauty of this world, doth not
its very beauty as it were with one voice answer thee, “I made not myself, God made me”?
10. For when Thy saints bless Thee, what say they? “They shall tell the glory of Thy
kingdom, and talk of Thy Power” (ver. 11). How powerful is God, who hath made the earth!
how powerful is God, who hath filled the earth with good things! how powerful is God, who
hath given to the animals each its own life! how powerful is God, who hath given different
seeds to the womb of the earth, that they might make to spring up such various shoots, such
beautiful trees! how powerful, how great is God! Do thou ask, creation answereth, and by
its answer, as by the confession of the creature, thou, O saint of God, blessest God, and
“talkest of His power.”
11. “That they may make known to the sons of men Thy power, and the glory of the
greatness of the beauty of Thy kingdom” (ver. 12). Thy saints then commend “the glory of
the greatness of the beauty of Thy kingdom,” the glory of the greatness of its beauty. There
is a certain “greatness of the beauty of Thy kingdom:” that is, Thy kingdom hath beauty,
and great beauty. Since whatever hath beauty, hath beauty from Thee, how great beauty
hath Thy whole kingdom! Let not the kingdom frighten us: it hath beauty also, wherewith
to delight us. For what is that beauty, which the saints shall hereafter enjoy, to whom it shall
be said, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, enjoy the kingdom”?5874 Whence shall they come?
whither shall they come? Behold, brethren, and, if ye can, as far as ye can, think of the beauty
of that kingdom which is to come; whence our prayer saith, “Thy kingdom come.” For that
kingdom we desire may come, that kingdom the saints proclaim to be coming. Observe this
world: it is beautiful. How beautiful are earth, sea, air, heavens, stars. Do not all these
frighten him who considereth them? Is not the beauty of them so conspicuous, that it seemeth
as though nothing more beautiful could be found? And here, in this beauty, in this fairness
almost unspeakable, here worm and mice and all creeping things of the earth live with thee,
they live with thee in all this beauty. How great is the beauty of that kingdom where none
5874 Matt. xxv. 34.
Psalm CXLV
but angels live with Thee! There is a greatness of a certain beauty; let it be loved before it is
seen, that when it is seen, it may be retained.
12. “Thy kingdom.” What kingdom mean I? “a kingdom of all ages.” For the kingdom
of this age too hath its own beauty, but there is not in it that greatness of beauty, such as in
the “kingdom of all ages.” “And Thy dominion is in every generation and generation” (ver.
13). This is the repetition we noticed, signifying either every generation, or the generation
which will be after this generation. “Faithful is the Lord in His words, and holy in all His
works.”5875 “Faithful is the Lord in His words:” for what hath He promised that He hath
not given? “Faithful is the Lord in His words.” Hereto there are certain things which He
hath promised, and hath not given; but let Him be believed from the things which He hath
given. We might well believe Him, if He only spake: He willed not that we should believe
Him speaking, but that we should have His Scriptures in our hands:…as though a kind of
bond of God’s, which all who pass by might read, and might keep to the path of its promise.
And how great things hath He already paid in accordance with that bond! Do men hesitate
to believe Him concerning the Resurrection of the dead and the Life to come, which alone
now remaineth to be paid, when, if He come to reckon with the unbelievers, the unbelievers
must blush? If God say to thee, “Thou hast My bond: I have promised judgment, the separ-
ation of good and bad, everlasting life for the faithful, and wilt thou not believe? There in
My bond read all that I have promised, reckon with me: verily even by counting up what I
have paid, thou canst believe that I shall pay what still I owe. In that bond thou hast My
only-begotten Son promised, “Whom I spared not, but gave Him up for you all:”5876 reckon
this then among what is paid. Read the bond: I promised therein that I would give by My
Son the earnest of the Holy Spirit: reckon that as paid. I promised therein the blood and the
crowns of the glorious Martyrs; let the White Mass5877 remind you that My debt has been
paid.…He setteth before the eyes of all His payment of His debts: some He hath paid in the
time of our ancestors, which we saw not: some He hath paid in our times, which they saw
not; throughout all generations He hath paid what was written. And what remaineth? Do
men not believe Him, when He hath paid all this? What remaineth? Behold thou hast
reckoned: all this He hath paid: is He become unfaithful for the few things which remain?
5875 This verse is not contained in the English version.
5876 Rom. viii. 32.
5877 This sermon appears from this to have been preached in the Basilica of the “White Mass.” The Roman
Martyrology, Aug. 24, has, “at Carthage, of the 300 holy martyrs, who, in the reign of Valerius and Gallienus,
first suffered manifold torments, and at last were thrown into a burning lime-pit, and won a glorious crown of
martyrdom. Hence they had the name of ‘The White Mass.’” There was a Basilica in memory of them at Utica.
Serm. 306 of St. Aug. is on their festival. See also Prud. Peristeph. 13; Ruinart, pp. 199, 518.
Psalm CXLV
God forbid! Wherefore? Because “the Lord is faithful in His words, and holy in all His
works.”
13. “The Lord strengtheneth all that are falling” (ver. 14). But who are “all that are fall-
ing”? All indeed fall in a general sense, but he meaneth those who fall in a particular way.
For many fall from Him, many also fall from their own imaginations. If they had evil ima-
ginations, they fall from them, and “God strengthened all that are falling.” They who lose
anything in this world, yet are holy, are as it were dishonoured in this world, from rich be-
come poor, from honoured of low estate, yet are they God’s saints; they are, as it were, falling.
But “God strengtheneth.” For “the just falleth seven times, and riseth again; but the wicked
shall be weakened in evils.”5878 When evils befall the wicked, they are weakened thereby;
when evils befall the righteous, “the Lord strengtheneth all that are falling.”…“And lifteth
up all those that have been cast down:” all, that is, who belong to him; for “God resisteth
the proud.”5879
14. “The eyes of all hope upon Thee, and Thou givest them food in due season” (ver.
15). Just as when thou refreshest a sick man in due season, when he ought to receive, then
Thou givest, and what he ought to receive, that Thou givest. Sometimes then men long, and
he giveth not: he who tendeth, knoweth the time to give. Wherefore say I this, brethren?
Lest any one be faint, if perchance he hath not been heard, when making some righteous
request of God. For when he maketh any unrighteous request, he is heard to his punishment:
but when making some righteous request of God, if perchance he have not been heard, let
him not be down-hearted, let him not faint, let his eyes wait for the food, which He giveth
in due season. When He giveth not, He therefore giveth not, lest that which He giveth do
harm.5880…“Thou givest them meat in due season.”
15. “Thou openest Thine Hand, and fillest every living thing with blessing” (ver. 16).
Though sometimes Thou givest not, yet “in due season” Thou givest: Thou delayest, not
deniest, and that in due season.” “Righteous is the Lord in all His ways, and holy in all His
works” (ver. 17). Both when He smiteth and when He healeth, He is righteous, and in Him
unrighteousness is not. Finally, all His saints, when set in the midst of tribulation, have first
praised His righteousness, and so sought His blessings. They first have said, “What Thou
doest is righteous.” So did Daniel ask, and other holy men: “Righteous are Thy judgments:
rightly have we suffered: deservedly have we suffered.” They laid not unrighteousness to
God, they laid not to Him injustice and folly. First they praised Him scourging, and so they
felt Him feeding.

Psalm CXLV
16. “The Lord is nigh unto all that call upon Him” (ver. 18). Where then is that, “Then
shall they call upon Me, and I will not hear them”?5881 See then what follows: “all who call
upon Him in truth.” For many call upon Him, but not in truth. They seek something else
from Him, but seek not Himself. Why lovest thou God? “Because He hath made me whole.”
That is clear: it was He that made thee so. For from none else cometh health, save Him.
“Because He gave me,” saith another, “a rich wife, whereas I before had nothing, and one
that obeyeth me.” This too He gave: thou sayest true. “He gave me,” saith another, “sons
many and good, He gave me a household, He gave me all good things.” Dost thou love Him
for this?…Therefore if God is good, who hath given thee what thou hast, how much more
blessed wilt thou be when He hath given thee Himself! Thou hast desired all these things of
Him: I beseech thee desire of Him Himself also. For these things are not truly sweeter than
He is, nor in any way are they to be compared to Him. He then who preferreth God Himself
to all the things which he has received, whereat he rejoiceth, to the things he has received,
he “calleth upon God in truth.”…
17. “He will perform the will of them that fear Him” (ver. 19). He will perform it, He
will perform it: though He perform it not at once, yet He will perform it. Certainly if therefore
thou fearest God, that thou mayest do His will, behold even He in a manner ministereth to
thee; He doeth thy will. “And He shall hear their prayer, and save them.” Thou seest that
for this purpose the Physician hears, that He may save. When? Hear the Apostle telling thee.
“For we are saved in hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: but if what we see not we
hope for, then do we with patience wait for it:5882 “the salvation,” that is, which Peter calleth
“ready to be revealed in the last time.”5883
18. “The Lord guardeth all that love Him, and all sinners He will destroy” (ver. 20).
Thou seest that there is severity with Him, with whom is so great sweetness. He will save all
that hope in Him, all the faithful, all that fear Him, all that call upon Him in truth: “and all
sinners He will destroy.” What “all sinners,” save those who persevere in sin; who dare to
blame God, not themselves; who daily argue against God; who despair of pardon for their
sins, and from this very despair heap up their sins; or who perversely promise themselves
pardon, and through this very promise depart not from their sins and impiety? The time
will come for all these to be separated, and for the two divisions to be made of them, one
on the right hand, the other on the left; and for the righteous to receive the everlasting
Kingdom, the wicked to go into everlasting fire. Since this is so, and we have heard the
blessing of the Lord, the works of the Lord, the wondrous things of the Lord, the mercies
of the Lord, the severity of the Lord, His Providence over all His works, the confession of
5881 Prov. i. 28.

all His works; observe how He concludeth in His praise, “My mouth shall speak the praise
of the Lord, and let all flesh bless His holy Name for ever and ever” (ver. 21).
Psalm CXLV
Psalm CXLVI.5884
1. …Behold the Psalm soundeth; it is the voice of some one (and that some one are ye,
if ye will), of some one encouraging his soul to praise God, and saying to himself, “Praise
the Lord, O my soul” (ver. 1). For sometimes in the tribulations and temptations of this
present life, whether we will or no, our soul is troubled; of which troubling he speaketh in
another Psalm.5885 But to remove this troubling, he suggesteth joy; not as yet in reality, but
in hope; and saith to it when troubled and anxious, sad and sorrowing, “Hope in God, for
I will yet confess to Him.”…
2. But who saith it, and to whom saith he it? What shall we say, brethren? Is it the flesh
that saith, “Praise thou the Lord, O my soul”? And can the flesh suggest good counsel to the
soul? However much the flesh be conquered, and subjected as a servant to us through
strength which the Lord imparteth, that it serve us entirely as a bond slave, enough for us
that it hinder us not.…For the body, inasmuch as it is the body, is even beneath the soul;
and every soul, however vile, is found more excellent than the most excellent body. And let
not this seem to you to be wonderful, that even any vile and sinful soul is better than any
great and most surpassing body. It is better, not in deserts, but in nature. The soul indeed
is sinful, is stained with certain defilements of lusts; yet gold, though rusted, is better than
the most polished lead. Let your mind then run over every part of creation, and ye will see
that what we are saying is not incredible, that a soul, however blameable, is yet more
praiseworthy than a praiseworthy body. There are two things, a soul and a body. The soul
I chide, the body I praise: the soul I chide, because it is sinful; the body I praise, because it
is sound. Yet it is in its own kind that I praise the soul, and in its own kind that I blame the
soul: and so in its own kind I praise the body, or blame it. If you ask me which is better,
what I have blamed or what I have praised, wondrous is the answer thou wilt receive.…So
you speak of the best horse and the worst man: yet thou preferrest the man thou findest
fault with to the horse thou praisest.…The nature of the soul is more excellent than the
nature of the body: it surpasseth it by far, it is a thing spiritual, incorporeal, akin to the
substance of God. It is somewhat invisible, it ruleth the body, moveth the limbs, guideth
the senses, prepareth thoughts, putteth forth actions, taketh in images of countless things;
who is there, in short, beloved brethren, who may suffice for the praises of the soul? And
yet such is the grace given to it, that this man saith, “Praise the Lord, O my soul.”…It is not
the flesh that saith it. Let the body be angel-like, still it is inferior to the soul, it cannot give
advice to its superior. The flesh when duly obedient is the handmaid of the soul: the soul
rules, the body obeys; the soul commands, the body performs; how then can the flesh give
this advice to the soul? Is it then perchance the soul herself, who saith to herself, and in a
5884 Lat. CXLV. Sermon to the people.
5885 Ps. xlii. 14, 15.
Psalm CXLVI
Psalm CXLVI
manner commandeth herself, and exhorteth and asketh herself? For through certain passions
in one part of her nature she wavered; but in another part, which they call the reasonable
mind, the wisdom whereby she thinks, clinging to God, and now sighing towards Him, she
perceives that certain inferior parts of her are troubled by worldly emotions, and by a certain
excitement of earthly desires, betake them to outward things, leaving God who is within; so
she recalleth herself from things outward to inward, from lower to higher, and says, “Praise
the Lord, O my soul.”…The soul itself giveth itself counsel from the light of God by the
reasonable mind, whereby it conceiveth the wisdom fixed in the everlasting nature of its
Author. It readeth there of somewhat to be feared, to be praised, to be loved, to be longed
for, and sought after: as yet it graspeth it not, it comprehendeth it not; it is, as it were, dazzled
with brightness; it has not strength to abide there. Therefore it gathers itself, as it were, into
a sound state, and saith, “Praise the Lord, O my soul.”…And then the soul, weighed down,
as it were, and unable to stand up as is fitting, answereth the mind, “I will praise the Lord
in my life” (ver. 2). What is, “in my life”? Because now I am in my death. Therefore first
encourage thyself, and say, “Praise the Lord, O my soul.” Thy soul answereth thee, I do
praise so far as I can, slightly, poorly, weakly. Wherefore? Because, “while we are in the
body, we are absent from the Lord.”5886…
3. “In my life.” Now what has it? It might answer thee, “My death.” Whence, “My death”?
because I am absent from the Lord. For if to cling to Him is life, to depart from Him is death.
But what comforteth thee? Hope. Now thou livest in hope: in hope praise, in hope sing. Thy
death is from the sadness of this life, thou livest in hope of a future life. And how wilt thou
praise thy Lord? “I will sing unto my God, as long as I have my being.” What sort of praise
is this, “I will sing unto my God as long as I have being”? Behold, my brethren, what sort of
being this will be; where there will be everlasting praise, there will be also everlasting being.
Behold, now thou hast being: dost thou sing unto God as long as thou hast being? Behold,
thou wast singing, and hast turned thyself away to some business, thou singest no longer,
yet thou hast being: thou hast being, yet thou singest not. It may be also thy desire turneth
thee to somewhat; not only dost thou not sing, but thou even offendest His ears, yet thou
hast being. What praise will that be, when thou praisest as long as thou hast being? But what
meaneth, “as long as I have being”? Will there be any time when he will not be? Nay, rather,
that “long” will be everlasting, and therefore it will be truly “long.” For whatever hath end
in time, however prolonged it is, is yet not “long.”…
4. “Put not your trust in princes” (ver. 3). Brethren, here we receive a mighty task; it is
a voice from heaven, from above it soundeth to us. For now through some kind of weakness
the soul of man, whensoever it is in tribulation here, despaireth of God, and chooseth to
rely on man. Let it be said to one when set in some affliction, “There is a great man, by whom
5886 2 Cor. v. 6.
Psalm CXLVI
thou mayest be set free;” he smileth, he rejoiceth, he is lifted up. But if it is said to him, “God
freeth thee,” he is chilled, so to speak, by despair. The aid of a mortal is promised, and thou
rejoicest; the aid of the Immortal is promised, and art thou sad? It is promised thee that
thou shalt be freed by one who needeth to be freed with thee, and thou exultest, as at some
great aid: thou art promised that Liberator, who needeth none to free Him, and thou des-
pairest, as though it were but a fable. Woe to such thoughts: they wander far; truly there is
sad and great death in them. Approach, begin to long, begin to seek and to know Him by
whom thou wast made. For He will not leave His work, if He be not left by His work.
5. …“His breath shall go forth, and he shall return to his earth: in that day shall all his
thoughts perish” (ver. 4). Where is swelling? where is pride? where is boasting? But perhaps
he will have passed to a good place, if indeed he have passed. For I know not whither he
who spake thus hath passed. For he spake in pride; and I know not whither such men pass,
save that I look into another Psalm, and see that their passage is an evil one. “I beheld the
wicked lifted up above the cedars of Libanus, and I passed by, and, lo, he was not; and I
sought him, and his place was not found.”5887 The good man, who passed by, and found
not the wicked, reached a place where the wicked is not. Wherefore, brethren, let us all
listen: brethren, beloved of God, let us all listen; in whatsoever tribulation, in whatsoever
longing for the heavenly gift, “let us not trust in princes, nor in sons of men, in whom is no
salvation.” All this is mortal, fleeting, perishable.
What then must we do, if we are not to hope in sons of men, nor in princes? What must
we do? “Blessed is he whose Helper is the God of Jacob” (ver. 5): not this man or that man;
not this angel or that angel; but, “blessed is he whose Helper is the God of Jacob:” for to
Jacob also so great an Helper was He, that of Jacob He made him Israel. O mighty help! now
he is Israel, “seeing God.” While then thou art placed here, and a wanderer not yet seeing
God, if thou hast the God of Jacob for thy Helper, from Jacob thou wilt become Israel, and
wilt be “seeing God,” and all toil and all groans shall come to an end, gnawing cares shall
cease, happy praises shall succeed. “Blessed is he whose Helper is the God of Jacob;” of this
Jacob. Wherefore is he happy? Meanwhile, while yet groaning in this life, “his hope is in the
Lord his God.”…Who is this, “Lord his God”?…“To us there is one God, the Father, of
whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things.”5888 Therefore
let Him be thy hope, even the Lord thy God; in Him let thy hope be. His hope too is in the
lord his god, who worshippeth Saturn; his hope is in the lord his god, who worshippeth
Neptune or Mercury; yea more, I add, who worshippeth his belly, of whom is said, “whose
god is their belly.”5889 The one is the god of the one, the other of the other. Who is this
5887 Ps. xxxvii. 35, 36.
5888 1 Cor. viii. 6.
5889 Philip. iii. 19.
Psalm CXLVI
“blessed” one? for “his hope is in the Lord his God.” But who is He? “Who made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that is in them” (ver. 6). My brethren, we have a great God; let us
bless His holy Name, that He hath deigned to make us His possession. As yet thou seest not
God; thou canst not fully love what as yet thou seest not. All that thou seest, He hath made.
Thou admirest the world; why not the Maker of the world? Thou lookest up to the heavens,
and art amazed: thou considerest the whole earth, and tremblest; when canst thou contain
in thy thought the vastness of the sea? Look at the countless number of the stars, look at all
the many kind of seeds, all the different sorts of animals, all that swimmeth in the water,
creepeth on the earth, flieth in the sky, hovereth in the air; how great are all these, how
beautiful, how fair, how amazing! Behold, He who made all these, is thy God. Put thy hope
in Him, that thou mayest be happy. “His hope is in the Lord his God.” Observe, my brethren,
the mighty God, the good God, who maketh all these things.…If he mentioned these things
only, perhaps thou wouldest answer me, “God, who made heaven and earth and sea, is a
great God: but doth He think of me?” It would be said to thee, “He made thee.” How so?
am I heaven, or am I earth, or am I sea? Surely it is plain; I am neither heaven, nor earth,
nor sea: yet I am on earth. At least thou grantest me this, that thou art on earth. Hear then,
that God made not only heaven and earth and sea: for He “made heaven and earth and sea,
and all that is in them.” If then He made all that is in them, He made thee also. It is too little
to say, thee; the sparrow, the locust, the worm, none of these did He not make, and He careth
for all. His care refers not to His commandment, for this commandment He gave to man
alone.…As regards then the tenor of the commandment, “God doth not take care for ox-
en:”5890 as regards His providential care of the universe, whereby He created all things, and
ruleth the world, “Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast.” Here perhaps some one may
say to me, “God careth not for oxen,” comes from the New Testament: “Thou, Lord, shalt
save both man and beast,” is from the Old Testament. There are some who find fault and
say, that these two Testaments agree not with one another.…Let us hear the Lord Himself,
the Chief and Master of the Apostles: “Consider,” saith He, “the fowls of the air; they sow
not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feedeth them.”5891
Therefore even beside men, these animals are objects of care to God, to be fed, not to receive
a law. As far then as regards giving a law, “God careth not for oxen:” as regards creating,
feeding, governing, ruling, all things have to do with God. “Are not two sparrows sold for
one farthing?” saith our Lord Jesus Christ, “and one of them shall not fall to the ground
without the will of your Father: how much better are ye than they.” 5892 Perhaps thou sayest,
5890 1 Cor. ix. 9.
5891 Matt. vi. 26.
5892 Matt. x. 29.
Psalm CXLVI
God counteth me not in this great multitude. There follows here a wondrous passage in the
Gospel: “the hairs of your head are all numbered.”5893
6. “Who keepeth truth for ever.” What “truth for ever”? what “truth” doth He “keep,”
and wherein doth “He keep it for ever”? “Who executeth judgment for them that suffer
wrong” (ver. 7). He avengeth them that suffer wrong. There cometh at once to thee the voice
of the Apostle: “now therefore there is altogether a fault among you, that ye go to law one
with another: why do ye not rather suffer wrong?” 5894 He urged thee not to suffer annoyance,
but to suffer wrong: for not every annoyance is wrong. For whatever thou sufferest lawfully
is not a wrong; lest perchance thou shouldest say, I also am among those who have suffered
wrong, for I have suffered such a thing in such a place, and such a thing for such a reason.
Consider whether thou hast suffered a wrong. Robbers suffer many things, but they suffer
no wrong. Wicked men, evil doers, house-breakers, adulterers, seducers, all these suffer
many evils, yet is there no wrong. It is one thing to suffer wrong; it is another to suffer
tribulation, or penalty, or annoyance, or punishment. Consider where thou art; see what
thou hast done; see why thou art suffering; and then thou seest what thou art suffering.
Right and wrong are contraries. Right is what is just. For not all that is called right, is right.
What if a man lay down for you unjust right? nor indeed is it to be called right, if it is unjust.
That is true right, which is also just. Consider what thou hast done, not what thou art suffer-
ing. If thou hast done right, thou art suffering wrong; if thou hast done wrong, thou art
suffering right.…
7. “Who giveth food to the hungry.” Behold, from thee I look for nothing: “God giveth
food to the hungry.” Who are “the hungry”? All. What is, all? To all things that have life, to
all men He giveth food: doth He not reserve some food for His beloved? If they have another
kind of hunger, they have also another kind of food. Let us first enquire what their hunger
is, and then we shall find their food. “Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteous-
ness, for they shall be filled.”5895 We ought to be God’s hungry ones.…“The Lord looseth
them that are fettered; the Lord lifteth up them that are dashed down; the Lord maketh wise
them that are blind” (ver. 8). Perfectly hath he by this last sentence explained to us all the
preceding ones: lest perchance, when he had said, “the Lord looseth them that are fettered,”
we should refer it to those fettered ones, who for some crime are bound in irons by their
masters: and in that he said, “He lifteth up them that are dashed down,” there should occur
to our minds some one stumbling or falling, or thrown from a horse. There is another kind
of fall, there are other kinds of fetters, just as there is other darkness and other light.
Whereas he said, “He maketh the blind wise;” he would not say, He enlightened the blind,
5893 Matt. x. 30.
5894 1 Cor. vi. 7.
5895 Matt. v. 6.
Psalm CXLVI
lest thou shouldest understand this also in reference to the flesh, as the man was enlightened
by the Lord, when He anointed his eyes with clay made with spittle, and so healed him: that
thou mightest not look for anything of this sort, when He is speaking of spiritual things, he
pointeth to a sort of light of wisdom, wherewith the blind are enlightened. Therefore in the
same way as the blind are enlightened with the light of wisdom, so are the fettered set free,
and those who are dashed down are lifted up. Whereby then have we been fettered? whereby
dashed down? Our body was once an ornament to us: now, we have sinned, and thereby
have had fetters put on us. What are our fetters? Our mortality.…“The Lord loveth the
righteous.” And who are the “righteous”? How far are they righteous now? Just as thou hast;
“the Lord, guardeth proselytes” (ver. 9). “Proselytes” are strangers. Every Church of the
Gentiles is a stranger. For it cometh in to the Fathers, not sprung of their flesh, but their
daughter by imitating them. Yet the Lord, not any man, guardeth them. “The orphan and
widow He will take up.” Let none think that He taketh up the orphan for his inheritance,
or the widow for any business of hers. True, God doth help them; and in all the duties of
the human race, he doeth a good work, who taketh care of an orphan, who abandoneth not
a widow: but in a certain way we are all orphans, not because our Father is dead, but because
He is absent.5896…
8. “And the way of sinners He shall root out.” What is, “the way of sinners”? To mock
at these things which we say. “Who is an orphan, who a widow? What kingdom of heaven,
what punishment of hell is there? These are fables of the Christians. To what I see, to that
will I live: “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”5897 Beware lest such men persuade
you of aught: let them not enter through your ears into your heart; let them find thorns in
your ears: let him, who seeketh to enter thus, go away pierced: for “evil communications
corrupt good manners.”5898 But here perhaps thou wilt say, “Wherefore then are they
prosperous? Behold, they worship not God, and commit every kind of evil daily: yet they
abound in those things, through want of which I toil.” Be not envious against sinners. What
they receive, thou seest; what is in store for them, seest thou not?…Wilt thou not believe
even the Lord thy God, who saith, “Broad and spacious is the way that leadeth to destruction,
and many there be that walk by it”? 5899 This “way the Lord will root out.” And, when “the
way of sinners” has been “rooted out,” what remaineth for us? “Come, ye blessed of My
father, enjoy the Kingdom;”5900 “The Lord shall reign for ever” (ver. 10). “O Sion, thy God”
shall reign for ever; surely thy God will not reign without thee. “For generation and genera-

tion.” He hath said it twice, because he could not say it for ever. And think not that eternity
is bounded by finite words. The word eternity consists of four syllables; in itself it is without
end. It could not be commended to thee, save thus, “for generation and generation.” Too
little hath he said: if he spoke it all day long, it were too narrow: if he spoke it all his life,
must he not at length hold his peace? Love eternity: without end shalt thou reign, if Christ
be thine End, with whom thou shalt reign for ever and ever. Amen.
Psalm CXLVI
Psalm CXLVII.5901
1. It is said to us, “Praise the Lord” (ver. 1). This is said to all nations, not to us alone.
And these words, sounded forth through separate places by the Readers, each Church heareth
separately; but the one same Voice of God proclaimeth unto all, that we praise Him. And
as though we asked wherefore we ought to praise the Lord, behold what reason he hath
brought forward: “Praise the Lord,” he saith, “for a Psalm is good.” Is this all the reward of
them that praise?…The “Psalm” is praise of God. This then he saith, “Praise the Lord, for
it is good to praise the Lord.” Let us not thus pass over the praise of the Lord. It is spoken,
and hath passed: it is done, and we are silent: we have praised, and then rested; we have
sung, and then rested. We go forth to some business which awaits us, and when other em-
ployments have found us, shall the praise of God cease in us? Not so: thy tongue praiseth
but for a while, let thy life ever praise. Thus then “a Psalm is good.”
2. For a “Psalm” is a song, not any kind of song, but a song to a psaltery. A psaltery is a
kind of instrument of music, like the lyre and the harp, and such kinds of instruments, which
were invented for music. He therefore who singeth Psalms, not only singeth with his voice,
but with a certain instrument besides, which is called a psaltery, he accompanieth his voice
with his hands. Wilt thou then sing a Psalm? Let not thy voice alone sound the praises of
God; but let thy works also be in harmony with thy voice.…To please then the ear, sing with
thy voice; but with thy heart be not silent, with thy life be not still. Thou devisest no fraud
in thy heart: thou singest a Psalm to God. When thou eatest and drinkest, sing a Psalm: not
by intermingling sweet sounds suited to the ear, but by eating and drinking moderately,
frugally, temperately: for thus saith the Apostle, “whether ye eat or drink, or whatever ye
do, do all to the glory of God.” 5902…If by immoderate voracity thou exceedest the due
bounds of nature, and gluttest thyself in excess of wine, however great praises of God thy
tongue sound, yet thy life blasphemeth Him. After food and drink thou liest down to sleep:
in thy bed neither commit any pollution, nor go beyond the license given by the law of God:
let thy marriage bed be kept chaste with thy wife: and if thou desire to beget children, yet
let there not be unbridled sensuality of lust: in thy bed give honour to thy wife,5903 for ye
are both members of Christ, both made by Him, both renewed by His Blood: so doing thou
praisest God, nor will thy praise be altogether silent. What, when sleep has come over thee?
Let not an evil conscience rouse thee from rest: so doth the innocence of thy sleep praise
God.…
3. “Let praises be pleasant to our God.” How? If He be praised by our good lives. Hear
that then praise will be pleasant to Him. In another place it is said, “Praise is not seemly in
5901 Lat. CXLVI. Sermon to the people of Carthage.
5902 1 Cor. x. 31.
5903 1 Pet. iii. 7.
Psalm CXLVII
Psalm CXLVII
the mouth of a sinner.”5904 If then in the mouth of a sinner praise is not seemly, neither is
it pleasant, for that only is pleasant which is seemly.…For praise may be pleasant to a man,
when he heareth one praising with neat and clever sentiments, and with a sweet voice; but
“let praise be pleasant to our God,” whose ears are open not to the mouth, but to the heart;
not to the tongue, but to the life of him that praiseth.
4. Who is “our God,” that praise should be pleasant to Him? He maketh Himself sweet
to us, He commendeth Himself to us; thanks to His condescension.…“But God commendeth
His love to us”…“in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”5905…Let us see
whether it be the commendation which the Apostle speaketh of, that Christ died for the
sinners and ungodly: “the Lord who buildeth up Jerusalem, and gathereth the dispersions
of Israel” (ver. 2). For the people of Jerusalem are the people of Israel. It is Jerusalem
“eternal in the heavens,” whereof the Angels are citizens also.…All the citizens then of that
city, through “seeing God,” rejoice in that great and wide and heavenly city; they gaze upon
God Himself. But we are wanderers from that city, driven out by sin, that we should not
remain there; weighed down by mortality, that we should not return thither. God looked
back on our wandering, and He who “buildeth up Jerusalem,” restored the part that had
fallen. How restored He the part that had fallen?…He sent then to our captive estate His
Son as a Redeemer. Take with Thee, said He, a bag, bear therein the price of the captives.
For He put on Him our mortal flesh, and therein was the Blood, by the shedding of which
we were to be redeemed. With that Blood He “gathered the dispersions of Israel.” And if
He gathered them that before were dispersed, how must we strive that they be gathered who
now are dispersed? If the dispersed have been gathered, that in the Hand of the Builder they
might be fashioned into the building, how should they be gathered who through disquiet
have fallen from the Hand of the Builder? Behold whom we praise; behold to whom we owe
praise all our life long.
5. How doth He gather? What doeth He in order to gather? “Who healeth the bruised
in heart” (ver. 3). Behold the way in which the dispersions of Israel are gathered, by the
healing of the bruised in heart. They who are not of a bruised heart, are not healed. What
is to bruise the heart? Let it be known, brethren, let it be done, that ye may be able to be
healed. For it is told in many other places of Scripture;…“the sacrifice of God is a troubled
spirit, a bruised and contrite heart God will not despise.” He healeth then the bruised in
heart, for He draweth nigh unto them to heal them; as is said in another place, “the Lord is
nigh unto them who have bruised their heart.”5906 Who are they that have “bruised their
heart”? The humble. Who are they that have not “bruised their heart”? The proud. The
5904 Ecclus. xv. 9.
5905 Rom. v. 8.
5906 Ps. xxxiv. 18.
Psalm CXLVII
bruised heart shall be healed, the puffed up heart shall be dashed down. For for this purpose
perhaps is it dashed down, that being bruised it may be healed. Let not our heart then,
brethren, desire to be set upright, before it be upright. It is ill for that to be uplifted which
is not first corrected.…
6. What are the means whereby He “bindeth up their bruises”? Just as physicians bind
up fractures. For sometimes (observe this, beloved; it is well known to those who have ob-
served it, or have heard it from physicians), sometimes when limbs are sound, but are
crooked and distorted, physicians break them in order to set them straight, and make a new
wound, because the soundness which was distorted was amiss.…
7. What are these means whereby He bindeth? The sacraments of this present life,
whereby in the mean time we obtain our comfort: and all the words we speak to you, words
which sound and pass away, all that is done in the Church in this present time, are the means
whereby “He bindeth up our bruises.” For just as, when the limb has become perfectly sound,
the physician taketh off the bandage; so in our own city Jerusalem, when we shall have been
made equal to the Angels, think ye that we shall receive there, what we have received here?
Will it be needful then that the Gospel be read to us, that our faith may abide? or that hands
be laid upon us by any Bishop? All these are means of binding up fractures; when we have
attained perfect soundness, they will be taken off; but we should never attain it, if they were
not bound up.
8. “Who telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their names” (ver. 4).
What great matter is it for God to “tell the number of the stars”! Men even have endeavoured
to do this; whether they have been able to achieve it, is their concern; they would not however
attempt it, did they not think that they should achieve it. Let us leave alone what they can
do, and how far they have attained; for God I think it no great matter to count all the stars.
Or doth He perhaps go over the number, lest He should forget it? Is it any great thing for
God to number the stars, by whom “the very hairs of your head are numbered”?5907 The
stars are certain lights in the Church comforting our night; all of whom the Apostle saith,
“In the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
world, holding the Word of life.”5908 These stars God counteth; all who shall reign with
Him, all who are to be gathered into the Body of His only-begotten Son, He hath counted,
and still counteth them. Whoso is unworthy, is not even counted. Many too have believed,
or rather may, with a kind of shadowy appearance of faith, have attached themselves to His
people: yet He knoweth what He counteth, what He winnoweth away. For so great is the
height of the Gospel, that it hath come to pass as was said, “I have declared, and have spoken:
they are multiplied above number:”5909 there are then among the people certain supernu-
5907 Matt. x. 30.
5908 Philip. ii. 15.
5909 Ps. xl. 5.
Psalm CXLVII
meraries, so to speak. What do I mean by supernumeraries? More than will be there.
Within these walls are more than will be in the kingdom of God, in the heavenly Jerusalem;
these are above the number. Let each one of you consider whether he shineth in darkness,
whether he refuseth to be led astray by the dark iniquity of the world; if he be not led astray,
nor conquered, he will be, as it were, a star, which God already numbereth. “And calling
them all by their names,” he saith. Herein is our whole reward. We may have certain names
with God, that God may know our names, this we ought to wish, for this to act, for this to
busy ourselves, as far as we are able; not to rejoice in other things, not even in certain spir-
itual gifts.…When the disciples returned from their mission exulting, and saying, “Lord,
even the devils are subject unto us in Thy Name” 5910—then He (knowing that many would
say, “have we not in Thy Name cast out devils?” to whom He should say, “I know you not”)
said, “In this rejoice not, that the devils are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because
your names are written in heaven.”5911
9. “Great is our Lord” (ver. 5). The Psalmist is filled with joy, he hath poured out his
words wonderfully: yet somewhat he was unable to speak, and how availed he to think on
it? “And great is His power, and of His understanding is no numbering.” He who “numbereth
the stars,” Himself cannot be numbered. Who can expound this? who can worthily even
imagine what is meant by, “and of His understanding is no number”?…Whatsoever then
that is infinite this world containeth, though it be infinite to man, yet is not to God: too little
is it to say, to God: even by the angels it is numbered. His understanding surpasses all calcu-
lators; it cannot be counted by us. Numbers themselves who numbereth? What than is there
with God? wherewith made He all things, and where made He all things, to whom it is said,
“Thou hast arrayed all things in measure, number, and weight”? 5912 Or who can number,
or measure, or weigh, measure and number and weight themselves, wherein God hath
ordered all things? Therefore, “of His understanding is no number.” Let human voices be
hushed, human thoughts still: let them not stretch themselves out to incomprehensible
things, as though they could comprehend them, but as though they were to partake of them,
for partakers we shall be.…Partakers then we shall be: let none doubt it: Scripture saith it.
And of what shall we be partakers, as though these were parts in God, as though God were
divided into parts? Who then can explain how many become partakers of one single sub-
stance? Require not then that which I think ye see cannot fitly be said: but return to the
healing of the Saviour, bruise your heart. He will guide it, He will bind it up where it is
broken, He will make it perfectly sound; and then those things will not be impossible with

Psalm CXLVII
us, which now are impossible. For it is good that he confess weakness, who desireth to attain
to the divine nature.
10. “The Lord taketh up the gentle” (ver. 6). For example; thou understandest not, thou
failest to understand, canst not attain: honour God’s Scripture, honour God’s Word, though
it be not plain: in reverence wait for understanding. Be not wanton to accuse either the ob-
scurity or seeming contradiction of Scripture. There is nothing in it contradictory: somewhat
there is which is obscure, not in order that it may be denied thee, but that it may exercise
him that shall afterward receive it. When then it is obscure, that is the Physician’s doing,
that thou mayest knock. He willed that thou shouldest be exercised in knocking; He willed
it, that He might open to thee when thou knockest. By knocking thou shalt be exercised;
exercised, thou shalt be enlarged; enlarged, thou shalt contain what is given. Be not then
indignant for that it is shut; be mild, be gentle. Kick not against what is dark, nor say, It
were better said, if it were said thus. For how canst thou thus say, or judge how it is expedient
it be said? It is said as it is expedient it be said. Let not the sick man seek to amend his rem-
edies: the Physician knoweth how to temper them: believe Him who careth for thee.
Therefore what cometh next?…“The Lord taketh up the gentle, but humbleth the sinners
even to the ground,” he intended a certain sort of sinners to be understood, from the gentle-
ness mentioned first. By sinners then in this place, we understand the fierce, and those who
are not gentle. Wherefore doth He “humble them even to the earth”? They carp at objects
of understanding, they shall perceive only things earthly.5913
11. “Begin to the Lord in confession” (ver. 7). Begin with this, if thou wouldest arrive
at a clear understanding of the truth. If thou wilt be brought from the road of faith to the
profession of the reality, “begin in confession.” First accuse thyself: accuse thyself, praise
God. What after confession? Let good works follow. “Sing unto our God upon the harp.”
What is, “Upon the harp”? As I have already explained, just like the Psalm upon the psaltery,
so also is the “harp:” not with voice only, but with works.
12. …“Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth” (ver.
8). Now thou art alarmed, because thou canst not see the heaven: when it hath rained thou
shalt gather fruit, and shalt see clear sky. Perhaps our God hath done this. For had we not
the obscurity of Scripture as an occasion, we should not say to you those things wherein ye
rejoice. This then perhaps is the rain whereat ye rejoice. It would not be possible for it to be
expressed to you by our tongue, were it not that God covereth with clouds of figures the
heaven of the Scriptures. For this purpose willed He that the words of the Prophets should
be obscure, that the servants of God might afterwards have that by interpreting which they
might flow over the ears and hearts of men, that they might receive from the clouds of God
the fatness of spiritual joy. “Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for
5913 [See this series, vol. iv. p. 364. Here is a digression upon men “not gentle,”—the Manichees.—C.]
Psalm CXLVII
the service of men.” Behold the fruit of the rain. “Who maketh,” saith he, “grass to grow
upon the mountains.” Doth it not also grow upon the low ground? Yes, but it is a great thing
that it groweth “on the mountains.”…For nothing could be more barren than the hard
mountains. “And herb for the service of men.” What “service”? Listen to Paul himself. “And
ourselves,” saith he, “your servants for Jesus Christ’s sake.” 5914 He who said, “If we have
sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things?” yet said,
that he was a “servant.” For we are your servants, brethren. Let none of us speak of himself,
as though he were greater than you. We shall be greater if we are more humble. “But who-
soever will be great among you” (it is the Lord’s saying), “shall be your servant.”5915 Paul
the Apostle, indeed, living by his own labour, refused even to receive “the grass of the
mountains;” he chose to want; nevertheless, the mountains gave “grass.” Because he chose
not to receive, ought the mountains therefore not to give, and so to remain barren? Fruit is
due to the rain, food is due to the servant, as the Lord saith, “Eat such things as they give
you:” and that they should not think that they gave aught of their own, He added, “for the
labourer is worthy of his hire.”5916
13. …Just now has been read, “Give to every one that asketh of thee;”5917 and in another
place Scripture5918 saith, “Let alms sweat in thy hand, till thou findest a righteous man to
whom to give it.” One there is who seeketh thee, another thou oughtest to seek. Leave not
indeed him who seeketh thee empty, for, “give to every one that asketh of thee;” yet still
there is another whom thou oughtest to seek; “find a righteous man to whom to give it.” Ye
will never do this, unless ye have somewhat set aside from your substance, each what pleaseth
him according to the needs of his family, as a sort of debt to be paid to the treasury. If Christ
have not a state5919 of His own, neither hath He a treasury.5920…Cut off then and prune
off some fixed5921 sum either from thy yearly profits or thy daily gains, else thou seemest
as it were to give of thy capital, and thy hand must needs hesitate, when thou puttest it forth

to that which thou hast not vowed. Cut off some part of thy income; a tenth if thou choosest,
though that is but little. For it is said that the Pharisees gave a tenth; “I fast twice in the week,
I give tithes of all that I possess.”5922 And what saith the Lord? “Except your righteousness
exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven.”5923 He whose righteousness thou oughtest to exceed, giveth a tenth: thou givest
not even a thousandth. How wilt thou surpass him whom thou matchest not? “Who prepareth
rain for the earth.”
14. “And giveth unto the cattle their food” (ver. 9). These are the cattle he meaneth,
even God’s flocks. God defraudeth not His flock of their food through men, for whose
“service He maketh the grass to grow.” “And to the young of the ravens that call upon Him.”
Shall we perchance think this, that the ravens call upon God to give them their food? Think
not that the unreasoning creature calls upon God: no creature knows how to call upon God,
save the reasonable alone. Consider it as spoken in a figure, lest thou think, as some evil
men say, that the souls of men migrate into cattle, dogs, swine, ravens. Give this no place
in your hearts or in your faith. The soul of man is made after the image of God: He will not
give His image to dog or swine. Who are “the young of the ravens”? The Israelites used to
say that they alone were righteous, because to them the Law had been given: all other men
of every nation they used to call sinners. And in truth all nations were given up to sin, to
idolatry, to the worship of stones and stocks: but did they continue so? Although the ravens
themselves, our fathers, did not, yet we, “the young of the ravens,” do call upon God.5924…For
“the young of the ravens,” who seemed to worship the images of their forefathers, have ad-
vanced, and turned to God. And now thou hearest “the young of the ravens” calling upon
the one God. What then? Sayest thou to “the young of the ravens,” “hast thou left thy father?”
Plainly I have, saith he; for he is a raven who calls not upon God. I, “the young of the raven,”
do call upon God.
15. “In the power of an horse He will not take pleasure” (ver. 10). The power “of an
horse” is pride. For the horse seemeth adapted as it were to bear a man aloft, that he may
be more uplifted as he goes. And in truth he has a neck which typifieth a sort of pride. Let
not men exalt themselves upon their worth, let them not think themselves uplifted by their
distinctions; let them beware lest they be thrown by an untamed horse.5925…“Nor in the
tabernacle of a man will He delight.” For the tabernacle of the Lord is the Holy Church
spread throughout the whole world. Heretics, separating themselves from the Church’s
tabernacles, have set up tabernacles for themselves. For if perchance it be the lot of any, who

5923 Matt. v. 20.
5924 1 Pet. i. 18.
5925 Ps. xx. 7.
Psalm CXLVII
is good and pious, who confesseth his own weakness, who is “the young of a raven that calleth
on God,” not to enjoy worldly distinction, he goeth not out of the Church, he setteth not
up for himself a tent outside the Church, wherein God will not delight. But what saith he?
“I have chosen to be cast away in the house of God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sin-
ners.”5926
16. But what addeth he? “The Lord will delight in them that fear Him, and in them that
hope in His mercy” (ver. 11). A robber is feared, and a wild beast is feared, and an unjust
and powerful man is much feared. “The Lord will delight in them that hope in His mercy.”
Behold, Judas, who betrayed our Lord, feared, but he did not hope in His mercy.…It is well
indeed that thou hast feared, but only if thou trustedst in His mercy, whom thou hast feared.
He in despair “went and hanged himself.” In such wise then fear the Lord, that thou trust
in His mercy.…
17. “Praise in unison, O Jerusalem, thy God” (ver. 12). Abiding yet in captivity, they
behold those flocks, or rather, the one flock of all its citizens, gathered from all sides into
that city; they see the joy of the mass, now after threshings and winnowings placed in the
garner, fearing nothing, suffering no toil nor trouble; and, as yet abiding here, in the midst
of the threshing they send forward their joy of hope, and pant for it, joining as it were their
hearts to the Angels of God, and to that people which shall abide with them in joy for ever.
For what wilt thou then do, O Jerusalem? Surely toil and groaning will pass away. What wilt
thou do? wilt thou plough, or sow, or plant vines, or make voyages, or trade? What wilt thou
do? Will it still be thy duty to be engaged in the works thou now doest, good though they
are, and spring from mercy? Consider thy numbers, consider on all sides thy company: see
whether any hungers, for thee to give bread to; see whether any thirsts, for thee to give a
cup of cold water to; see whether any is a stranger, for thee to take in; see whether any is
sick, for thee to visit; see whether any is at strife, for thee to reconcile him; see whether any
is dying, for thee to bury him. What then wilt thou do? “Praise in unison, O Jerusalem, thy
God.” Behold, this is thy business. As is wont to be said in inscriptions, “Use it and be
happy.”5927
18. Be ye Jerusalem; remember of whom it is said, “Lord, in Thy city their image Thou
shalt bring to nought.”5928 These are they who now rejoice in such pomps; among them are
they who have not come hither to-day because there is a show. To whom is it a gift?5929 to
5926 Ps. lxxxiv. 10.
5927 Utere felix. This and other like expressions seem, from Morcelli, Opera Epigraphica, vol. i. p. 415, to
have been usual in inscriptions upon cups and like works of art, probably when given as presents.
5928 Ps. lxxiii. 20.
5929 A play on the double meaning of the word munus, which, meaning literally “a gift,” is also used in a
special sense for “as how of gladiators.”
Psalm CXLVII
whom is it a loss? or why is it a gift? why is it a loss? For not they only who exhibit such
shows are smitten with loss, but with much greater loss are they smitten who delight in
gazing on them. The former have their chest drained of its gold, the latter have their breast
robbed of the riches of righteousness. Most of the exhibiters of shows have to mourn for
selling their estates; how ought the sinners to mourn, for losing their souls: Was it then for
this that the Lord cried out on the Lord’s Day, “Watch ye,” that to-day men should watch
in this way. I beseech you, ye citizens of Jerusalem, I beseech you by the peace of Jerusalem,
by the Redeemer, the Builder, the Ruler of Jerusalem, that ye address your prayers to God
for them. May they see, may they feel, that they are trifling; and, intent as they are on the
sights which please them, may at length look on themselves, and be displeased. For in many
we rejoice that this has already been done: and once we too sat there and were mad: and
how many think we now sit there, who shall yet be, not only Christians, but also Bishops!
From what is past, we conjecture what is to be: from what has already been done, we an-
nounce beforehand what God will do. Let your prayers be wakeful, ye groan not for nothing.
Certainly they who have already escaped, praying for those who are still in danger, because
they too having been among those in danger, are heard; and God shall drag His people out
of the captivity of Babylon; by all means He shall redeem and deliver them, and the number
of the saints who bear the image of God shall be perfected.…“Praise in unison,” because
thou consistest of many: “praise,” because thou hast been made one.5930 “We being many,”
saith the Apostle, “are one in Christ.”5931 As then we are many, “we praise in unison;” as
we are one, we “praise.” The same are many and one, because He in whom they are one5932
is ever One.5933
19. Wherefore, saith this Jerusalem, do I praise in unison the Lord, and, as Sion, praise
my God? Jerusalem is the same as Sion. For different reasons has it the two names. Jerusalem
meaneth “visions of peace;” Sion meaneth “watching.”5934 See whether these words do not
sound like sights;5935 that the Gentiles may not think that they have sights and we have
none. Sometimes after the theatre or amphitheatre breaks up, when the crowd of lost ones
begins to be vomited forth from that den, sometimes, retaining in their minds images of
their vain amusements, and feeding their memory with things not only useless but even
hurtful, rejoicing in them as if they were sweet, while they are really deadly; they see often,
it may be, the servants of God pass by, they recognise them by their garb or headdress, or

they know them by sight,5936 and they say to one another, or inwardly, “Wretched people,
how much they lose!” Brethren, let us return their good will (for they do mean it well) with
prayers to the Lord. They wish us well; but “he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.”5937
If he hateth his own soul, how shall he love my soul? Yet with a perverse, and empty, and
vain good will, if indeed it may be called good will, they grieve that we lose what they love:
let us pray that they lose not what we love. Behold of what character that Jerusalem is to be
which he exhorteth to praise, or rather foreseeth will praise. For the praises of that city,
when we shall see and love and praise, will not need to be urged on and stirred up by the
voice of prophecy; but the Prophets now say this, to drink in as far as while they remain in
this flesh they can, the future joys of the blessed, and then giving them forth into our ears,
to arouse in us love of that city. Let us burn with longing, let us not be slothful in spirit.
“Praise thy God, O Sion.”
20. He saith, “He hath made strong the bars of thy gates” (ver. 13). The making bars
strong is not for open gates, but shut ones, wherefore most manuscripts read, “He hath
made strong the bolts5938 of thy gates.” Observe, beloved. He biddeth Jerusalem when closed
in to praise the Lord. We praise in unison now, we praise now; but it is amid offences. Many
where we wish not, enter in: many though we wish it not, go out: therefore offences are
frequent. “And because iniquity hath abounded,” saith the Truth, “the love of many waxeth
cold:”5939 because men come in whom we cannot discern, because men go out whom we
cannot retain. Wherefore is this? Because not yet is there perfection, not yet is there the bliss
that shall be. Wherefore is this? Because as yet it is the threshing-floor, not yet the garner.
What therefore will be then, save no fear that aught of this kind will happen? He said not
only, He hath set, but, “He hath made strong the bars of thy gates.” Let none go out, let none
come in. Let none go out, we rejoice: let none come in, we fear. Nay, fear not this: when
thou hast entered it will be said: only be thou in the number of virgins, who carried their
oil with them.…
21. “He hath blessed thy children within thee.” Who? He “who hath set peace as thy
borders.” How ye all exult!5940 Love peace, my brethren. Greatly are we delighted, when
the love of peace crieth from your hearts. How greatly doth it delight you! I had said nothing:
I had explained nothing: I but read the verse, and ye shouted. What was it that shouted in
you? The love of peace.…children of the kingdom, O citizens of Jerusalem, in Jerusalem is
the vision of peace: and all who love peace are blest in her, and they enter in, when the doors

are being shut, and the bars made strong. This, which when but named ye so love and esteem,
this follow after, this long for: this love in your home, in your business, in your wives, in
your sons, in your slaves, in your friends, in your enemies.…
22. What ye cried out a while ago at the very mention of peace, ye cried from longing:
your cry was from thirst, not from fulness; for there will be perfect righteousness where will
be perfect peace. Now we hunger and thirst after righteousness. “They shall be filled.”5941
How shall they be filled? When we have arrived at peace. Therefore when he had said, “Who
hath set peace for thy borders,” because there is fulness and no want, he added at once, “and
filleth thee with the fat of wheat” (ver. 14).…
23. “Who sendeth forth His Word to the earth” (ver. 15). Behold, on earth we toil, weary,
fainting, sluggish, cold: when should we be raised up to the fat of wheat that satisfieth, did
not He send His Word to the earth, whereby we were weighed down, to the earth, whereby
we were hindered from returning? He sent His Word, He deserted us not even in the wilder-
ness, He rained manna from heaven. “Who sendeth forth His Word to the earth;” and to
earth His Word came. How? or what is His Word? “Even unto swiftness His Word runneth.”
He said not, “His Word is swift,” but, “His Word runneth even unto swiftness.” Let us un-
derstand, my brethren: He could not have chosen a better word. He who is hot grows hot
by heat, he who is cold grows cold by cold, he who is swift becometh swift by swiftness.…To
what degree then doth it run? “Even to swiftness.” Increase as much as you will the swiftness
of the Word, and say, It is as swift as this or that, as birds, as the winds, as the Angels; is any
of these as great as swiftness itself, “even unto swiftness”? What is swiftness itself, brethren?
It is everywhere; it is not in part. This belongeth to the Word of God, not to be in part, to
be everywhere by Himself the Word, whereby He is “the Power of God and the Wisdom of
God,”5942 before He had taken flesh upon Him. If we think of God in the Form of God, the
Word equal to the Father, this is the Wisdom of God, of which is said, “It reacheth from
one end to the other mightily.”5943 What mighty speed! “It reacheth from one end to the
other mightily.”…
24. We then are burdened by the sluggishness of this cold body, and the bonds of this
earthly and corruptible life; have we no hope of receiving “the Word,” which “runneth even
unto swiftness”? or hath abandoned us, though by the body we are depressed to the lowest
depths? Did not He predestinate us, before we were born in this mortal and sluggish body?
He then, who predestinated us, gave snow to the earth, even ourselves. For now let us come
to those somewhat obscure verses of the Psalm, let those entanglements begin to be unrolled.
Behold, we are sluggish on this earth, and are as it were frozen here. And just as happens to
5941 Matt. v. 6.
5942 1 Cor. i. 24.
5943 Wisd. viii. 1.
Psalm CXLVII
the flakes of snow, for they freeze above, then fall down; so as love groweth cold, human
nature falleth down to this earth, and involved in a sluggish body becometh like snow. But
in that snow are predestined sons of God. For, “He giveth snow like wool” (ver. 16). What
is “like wool”? It meaneth, of the snow which He hath given, of these, who are as yet slow
in spirit and cold, whom He hath predestinated, He is about to make somewhat. For wool
is the material of a garment: when we see wool, we look on it as a sort of preparation for a
garment. Therefore since He hath predestinated these, who at present are cold and creep
on earth, and as yet glow not with the spirit of love (for as yet He speaketh of predestination),
God hath given these as a sort of wool: He is about to make of them a garment. Rightly did
the “raiment” of Christ “shine” on the mountain, “like snow.”5944 The raiment of Christ
did shine like snow, as though of that snow a garment had already been made: of which
wool, that is, of the snow which He gave like wool, they being as yet predestined, were
sluggish: but wait, see what followeth. Since He gave them as wool, a garment is made of
them. For as the Church is called the Body of Christ, so is the Church also called the garment
of Christ: hence cometh that which is said by the Apostle, “that He might present it to
Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle.”5945 Let Him then present unto
Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle; let Him make Himself a garment of
that wool, which He had predestinated in the snow. While men are yet unbelieving, and
cold, and sluggish, let Him make a garment of this wool. That it may be washed from spots,
let it be cleansed by faith: that it may have no wrinkle, let it be stretched out upon the cross.…
25. “He scattereth mist like ashes.” “He scattereth,” saith the Psalmist, “mist like ashes.”
Who? He “who giveth snow like wool.” For whom He predestined, He calleth to repentance;
for “whom He predestined, them He also called.” But “ashes” are connected with repentance.
Hear Him calling to repentance, when He upbraided certain cities, saying, “Woe unto thee,
Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which have been done in you
had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they had long ago repented in dust and ashes.”5946
Therefore, “He scattereth mist like ashes.” What is, “He scattereth mist like ashes”? When
a man is called to learn about God, and it is said to him, “Receive the truth;” he beginneth
to wish to receive the Truth, but is not able; he seeth that He is under a sort of darkness,
which before he saw not.…Wander not in the mist, follow in faith. But forasmuch as thou
endeavourest to see and art not able, repent of thy sins, for mist is scattered like ashes. Repent
thee now of having been obstinate against God, repent of having followed thine own evil
ways. Thou hast come into this state where it is difficult for thee to see the vision of bliss,
and the mist will be healthful to thee, which God scattereth like ashes. Thou thyself art as
5944 Matt. xvii. 2.
5945 Eph. v. 27.
5946 Matt. xi. 21.
Psalm CXLVII
yet a mist, but like ashes. For they that are penitent, as yet roll themselves in ashes, my
brethren, testifying, as it were, that they are like it, saying unto God, “I am ashes.” For a
certain Scripture saith, “I have despised myself, and wasted away, I have reckoned myself
earth and ashes.”5947 This is the humility of the penitent. When Abraham speaketh to his
God, and wisheth the burning of Sodom to be disclosed to him, he saith, “I am but earth
and ashes.”5948 How hath this humility ever been found in great and holy men!
26. “Who sendeth His crystal like morsels of bread” (ver. 17). We need not spend our
toil again in saying what crystal is. We have already said it, and I do not think that ye, beloved,
have forgotten it. What is then, “He sendeth His crystal like morsels of bread”? What is
“crystal”? It is very hard, it is very tightly congealed; it can not, like snow, be easily melted.
Snow, hardened by many years’ duration, and by the succession of ages, is called “crystal,”
and this “He sendeth like morsels of bread.” What meaneth this? They were too hard, no
longer fit to be compared to snow, but to crystal; but they too are predestinated and called,
and some of them even so as to feed others, to be useful to others also. And what need is
there to enumerate many, whom we happen to know, this one and that one? Every one when
he thinks can recall to mind how hardened and obstinate some of those whom he knows
have been, how they have struggled against the truth; yet now they preach the truth, they
have been made morsels of bread. Who is that one Bread? “We being many,” saith the
Apostle, “are one Body in Christ;”5949 he saith also, “we being many are one Bread and one
Body.”5950 If then the whole Body of Christ is one Bread, the members of Christ are morsels
of Bread. Of some that are hard He maketh members of Himself, and useful for feeding
others.…Behold, the Apostle Paul was a crystal, hard, resisting the truth, crying out against
the Gospel, hardening himself, as it were, against the sun.…Since then he was crystal, he
appeared clear and white, but he was hard and very cold. How was he bright and white?
“An Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee.” Behold the brightness of
crystal. Now hear the hardness of crystal. “As touching zeal, persecuting the Church”5951
of Christ. Among the stoners of the holy martyr Stephen, was he, hard, perhaps harder than
all. “For he kept the raiment of all who were stoning,”5952 so that he stoned by the hands of
all.
27. Thus then we see “the snow, the mist, the crystal:” it is good that He blow and thaw
them. For if He blow not, if He Himself thaw not the hardness of this ice, “in the face of His

Psalm CXLVII
cold who shall stand?” He abandoneth a sinner, behold, He calleth him not; behold, He
openeth not his perception; behold, He poureth not in grace; let the man thaw himself, if
he can, from the ice of folly. He cannot. Wherefore can he not? “In the face of His cold who
shall stand?” Behold him then growing harder, and saying, “O wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of this death?” Behold, I am growing cold, behold, I am
growing hard, what heat shall thaw me that I may run? “Who shall deliver me from the body
of this death?.…In the face of His cold who shall stand?” And who shall free himself, if God
abandon him? Who is it that freeth? “The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
5953 Are we then to despair? God forbid. For it goeth on, “He shall send out His Word, and
melt them” (ver. 18). Let not then the snow despair, nor the mist, nor the crystal. For of the
snow, as of wool, a garment is being made. That mist findeth safety in repentance: for,
“whom He predestinated, them He also called.” But even though they be the very hardest
among the predestinated, though they have been for a long time hardening, and are become
crystal, they will not be hard to the mercy of God. “He shall send out His Word, and melt
them.” What is “melt”? Understand not “melt” in an ill sense: it meaneth, He shall liquefy,
He shall thaw them. For they are hard through pride. Rightly is pride called also dulness:
for whatever is dull, is also cold.…Despair not even of the crystal. Hear a saying of the
crystal. “Who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.”5954 But wherefore
doth God melt the crystal? That the snow despair not of itself. For he saith, “For this cause
I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a
pattern to them that hereafter should believe on Him unto eternal life.”5955 God then calleth
unto the Gentiles, “Be melted, O crystal; come, ye snows.” “His Spirit shall blow, and the
waters shall flow.” Lo, the “crystal” and the “snows” are melted, they turn into water, “let
them that thirst, come and drink.”5956 Saul, hard as crystal, persecuted Stephen unto death;
Paul, now in the living water,5957 calleth the Gentiles to the Fount.…
28. “Announcing His Word unto Jacob, His Righteousnesses and Judgments unto Israel”
(ver. 19). What “Righteousnesses,” what “Judgments”? Because whatever mankind had
suffered here before, when it was “snow” and “mist” and “crystal,” it suffered for the deserts
of its pride and uplifting against God. Let us go back to the origin of our fall, and see that
most truly is it sung in the Psalm, “Before I was troubled I went wrong.”5958 But he who
says, “Before I was troubled I went wrong,” saith also, “It is good for me that Thou hast

humbled me, that I may learn Thy Righteousnesses.”5959 These righteousnesses Jacob learnt
from God, who made him to wrestle with an Angel; under the guise of which Angel, God
Himself wrestled with him. He held Him, he exerted violence to hold Him, he prevailed to
hold Him: He caused Himself to be held, in mercy, not in weakness. Jacob therefore wrestled,
and prevailed: he held Him and when he seemed to have conquered Him asked to be blessed
of Him.5960 How did he understand with Whom he had wrestled, Whom he had held?
Wherefore did he wrestle violently, and hold Him? Because “the kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence, and the violent take it by force.”5961 Wherefore then did he wrestle? Because it is
with toil. Wherefore do we with difficulty hold, what we so easily lose? Lest, easily getting
back what we have lost, we learn to lose that which we hold. Let man have toil to hold: he
will hold firmly, what he has only held after toil. These His judgments therefore God
manifested to Jacob and Israel.…
29. “He hath not done so to the whole race” (ver. 20). Let none deceive you: it is not
announced to any nation, this judgment of God; namely, how the righteous and the unright-
eous suffer, how all suffer for their deserts, how the righteous themselves are freed by the
grace of God, not in their own merits. This is not announced to the whole race, but only to
Jacob, only to Israel. What then do we, if He hath not announced it to the whole race, but
only to Jacob, only to Israel? Where will we be? In Jacob. “He hath not manifested His
judgments to them.” To whom? To all nations. How then are the “snows” called, when the
crystal is melted? How are the nations called, now Paul is justified? How, save to be in Jacob?
The wild olive is cut off from its stock, to be grafted into the olive: now they belong to the
olive, no longer ought they to be called nations,5962 but one nation in Christ, the nation of
Jacob, the nation of Israel…What is Israel? “Seeing God.” Where shall he see God? In peace.
What peace? The peace of Jerusalem; for, saith he, “He hath set peace for thy borders.” There
shall we praise: there shall we all be one, in One, unto One: for then, though many, we shall
not be scattered.

Psalm CXLVII
Psalm CXLVIII.5963
1. The subject of our meditation in this present life should be the praises of God; for the
everlasting exaltation of our life hereafter will be the praise of God, and none can become
fit for the life hereafter, who hath not practised himself for it now. So then now we praise
God, but we pray to Him too. Our praise is marked by joy, our prayer by groans.…On ac-
count of these two seasons, one, that which now is in the temptations and tribulations of
this life, the other, that which is to be hereafter in everlasting rest and exultation; we have
established also the celebration of two seasons, that before Easter and that after Easter. That
which is before Easter signifieth tribulation, in which we now are; that which we are now
keeping after Easter, signifieth the bliss in which we shall hereafter be. The celebration then
which we keep before Easter is what we do now: by that which we keep after Easter we sig-
nify what as yet we have not. Therefore we employ that time in fastings and prayer, this
present time we spend in praises, and relax our fast. This is the Halleluia which we sing,
which, as you know, meaneth (in Latin), Praise ye the Lord. Therefore that period is before
the Lord’s Resurrection, this, after His Resurrection: by which time is signified the future
hope which as yet we have not: for what we represent after the Lord’s Resurrection, we shall
have after our own. For in our Head both are figured, both are set forth. The Baptism of the
Lord setteth forth to us this present life of trial, for in it we must toil, be harassed, and, at
last, die; but the Resurrection and Glorification of the Lord setteth forth to us the life which
we are to have hereafter, when He shall come to recompense due rewards, evil to the evil,
good to the good. And now indeed all the evil men sing with us, Halleluia; but, if they per-
severe in their wickedness, they may utter with their lips the song of our life hereafter; but
the life itself, which will then be in the reality which now is typified, they cannot obtain,
because they would not practise it before it came, and lay hold on what was to come.
2. “Halleluia.” “Praise the Lord,” thou sayest to thy neighbour, he to thee: when all are
exhorting each other, all are doing what they exhort others to do. But praise with your whole
selves: that is, let not your tongue and voice alone praise God, but your conscience also,
your life, your deeds. For now, when we are gathered together in the Church, we praise:
when we go forth each to his own business, we seem to cease to praise God. Let a man not
cease to live well, and then he ever praiseth God.…It is impossible for a man’s acts to be
evil, whose thoughts are good. For acts issue from thought: nor can a man do anything or
move his limbs to do aught, unless the bidding of his thought precede: just as in all things
which ye see done throughout the provinces, whatsoever the Emperor biddeth goeth forth
from the inner part of his palace throughout the whole Roman Empire.5964 How great
commotion is caused at one bidding by the Emperor as he sits in his palace! He but moveth
5963 Lat. CXLVIII. Sermon to the people.
5964 [A striking illustration of (the Christmas morning Lesson, Anglican) Luke ii. 1.—C.]
Psalm CXLVIII
Psalm CXLVIII
his lips, when he speaketh: the whole province is moved, when what he speaketh is being
executed. So in each single man too, the Emperor is within, his seat is in the heart. If he be
good and biddeth good things, good things are done: if he be bad and biddeth evil things,
evil things are done. When Christ sitteth there, what can He bid, but what is good? When
the devil is the occupant, what can he bid, but evil? But God hath willed that it should be in
thy choice for whom thou wilt prepare room, for God, or for the devil: when thou hast
prepared it, he who is occupant will also rule. Therefore, brethren, attend not only to the
sound; when ye praise God, praise with your whole selves: let your voice, your life, your
deeds, all sing.
3. “Praise ye the Lord from heaven” (ver. 1). As though he had found things in heaven
holding their peace in the praise of the Lord, he exhorteth them to arise and praise. Never
have things in heaven held their peace in the praises of their Creator, never have things on
earth ceased to praise God. But it is manifest that there are certain things which have breath
to praise God in that disposition wherein God pleaseth them. For no one praiseth aught,
save what pleaseth him. And there are other things which have not breath of life and under-
standing to praise God, but yet, because they also are good, and duly arranged in their
proper order, and form part of the beauty of the universe, which God created, though they
themselves with voice and heart praise not God, yet when they are considered by those who
have understanding, God is praised in them; and, as God is praised in them, they themselves
too in a manner praise God.5965…
4. “Praise ye the Lord from heaven: praise Him in the high places.”5966 First he saith,
“from heaven,” then from earth; for it is God that is praised, who made heaven and earth.
All in heaven is calm and peaceful; there is ever joy, no death, no sickness, no vexation; there
the blessed ever praise God; but we are still below: yet, when we think how God is praised
there, let us have our heart there, and let us not hear to no purpose, “Lift up your hearts.”
Let us lift up our heart above, that it become not corrupted on earth: for we take pleasure
in what the Angels do there. We do it now in hope: hereafter we shall in reality, when we
have come thither. “Praise Him” then “in the high places.”
5. “Praise Him, all ye angels of His, praise Him, all His powers” (ver. 2). “Praise Him,
sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars and light” (ver. 3). “Praise Him, ye heaven of heavens,
and waters that are above the heavens” (ver. 4). “Let them praise the Name of the Lord”
(ver. 5). When can he unfold all in his enumeration? Yet he hath in a manner touched upon
them all summarily, and included all things in heaven praising their Creator. And as though
it were said to him, “Why do they praise Him? what hath He conferred on them, that they
5965 [Homo Naturæ minister et interpres.—Bacon. The “Hymn of the Three Children” was in his mind: it
became very early one of the hymns of the Church.—C.]
5966 [In excelsis.—C.]
Psalm CXLVIII
should praise Him?” he goeth on, “for He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and
they were created.” No wonder if the works praise the Worker, no wonder if the things that
are made praise the Maker, no wonder if creation praise its Creator. In this Christ also is
mentioned, though we seem not to have heard His Name.…By what were they made? By
the Word?5967 How doth he show in this Psalm, that all things were made by the Word?
“He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.” No one speaketh,
no one commandeth, save by word.
6. “He hath established them for the age, and for age upon age” (ver. 6). All things in
heaven, all things above, all powers and angels, a certain city on high, good, holy, blessed;
from whence because we are wanderers, we are wretched; whither because we are to return,
we are blessed in hope; whither when we shall have returned, we shall be blessed indeed;
“He hath given them a law which shall not pass away.” What sort of command, think ye,
have things in heaven and the holy angels received? What sort of command hath God given
them? What, but that they praise Him? Blessed are they whose business is to praise God!
They plough not, they sow not, they grind not, they cook not; for these are works of necessity,
and there is no necessity there. They steal not, they plunder not, they commit no adultery;
for these are works of iniquity, and there is no iniquity there. They break not bread for the
hungry, they clothe not the naked, they take not in the stranger, they visit not the sick, they
set not at one the contentious, they bury not the dead; for these are works of mercy, and
there there is no misery, for mercy to be shown to. O blessed they! Think we that we too
shall be like this? Ah! let us sigh, let us groan in sighing. And what are we, that we should
be there? mortal, outcast, abject, earth and ashes! But He, who hath promised, is almighty.…
7. Let him then turn himself to things on earth too, since he hath already spoken the
praises of things in heaven. “Praise ye the Lord from the earth” (ver. 7). For wherewith began
he before? “Praise ye the Lord from heaven:” and he went through things in heaven: now
hear of things on earth. “Dragons and all abysses.” “Abysses” are depths of water: all the
seas, and this atmosphere of clouds, pertain to the “abyss.” Where there are clouds, where
there are storms, where there is rain, lightning, thunder, hail, snow, and all that God willeth
should be done above the earth, by this moist and misty atmosphere, all this he hath men-
tioned under the name of earth, because it is very changeable and mortal; unless ye think
that it raineth from above the stars.5968 All these things happen here, close to the earth.
Sometimes even men are on the tops of mountains, and see the clouds beneath them, and
5967 John i. 1, 2.
5968 [See A.N.F. vol. vii. p. 57.—C.]
Psalm CXLVIII
often it raineth: and all commotions which arise from the disturbance of the atmosphere,
those who watch carefully see that they happen here, in this lower part of the universe.…Thou
seest then what kind all these things are, changeable, troublous, fearful, corruptible: yet they
have their place, they have their rank, they too in their degree fill up the beauty of the uni-
verse, and so they praise the Lord. He turns then to them, as though He would exhort them
too, or us, that by considering them we may praise the Lord. “Dragons” live about the water,
come out from caverns, fly through the air; the air is set in motion by them: “dragons” are
a huge kind of living creatures, greater there are not upon the earth. Therefore with them
he beginneth, “Dragons and all abysses.” There are caves of hidden waters, whence springs
and streams come forth: some come forth to flow over the earth, some flow secretly beneath;
and all this kind, all this damp nature of waters, together with the sea and this lower air, are
called abyss, or “abysses,” where dragons live and praise God. What? Think we that the
dragons form choirs, and praise God? Far from it. But do ye, when ye consider the dragons,
regard the Maker of the dragon, the Creator of the dragon: then, when ye admire the dragons,
and say, “Great is the Lord who made these,” then the dragons praise God by your voices.
8. “Fire, hail, snow, ice, wind of storms, which do His word” (ver. 8). Wherefore added
he here, “which do His word”? Many foolish men, unable to contemplate and discern cre-
ation, in its several places and rank, performing its movements at the nod and commandment
of God think that God doth indeed rule all things above, but things below He despiseth,
casteth aside, abandoneth, so that He neither careth for them, nor guideth, nor ruleth them;
but that they are ruled by chance, how they can, as they can: and they are influenced by what
they say sometimes to one another: e.g. “If it were God that gave rain, would He rain into
the sea? What sort of providence,” they say, “is this? Getulia is thirsty, and it rains into the
sea.” They think that they handle the matter cleverly. One should say to them, “Getulia does
at all events thirst, thou dost not even thirst.” For good were it for thee to say to God, “My
soul hath thirsted for Thee.”5969 For he that thus argueth is already satisfied; he thinketh
himself learned, he is not willing to learn, therefore he thirsteth not. For if he thirsted, he
would be willing to learn, and he would find that everything happeneth upon earth by God’s
Providence, and he would wonder at the arrangement of even the limbs of a flea. Attend,
beloved. Who hath arranged the limbs of a flea and a gnat, that they should have their
proper order, life, motion? Consider one little creature, even the very smallest, whatever
thou wilt. If thou considerest the order of its limbs, and the animation of life whereby it
moveth; how doth it shun death, love life, seek pleasures, avoid pain, exert divers senses,
vigorously use movements suitable to itself! Who gave its sting to the gnat, for it to suck
blood with? How narrow is the pipe whereby it sucketh! Who arranged all this? who made
all this? Thou art amazed at the smallest things; praise Him that is great. Hold then this, my
5969 Ps. cxliii. 6; Ps. lxiii. 1; Matt. v. 6.
Psalm CXLVIII
brethren, let none shake you from your faith or from sound doctrine. He who made the
Angel in heaven, the Same also made the worm upon earth: the Angel in heaven to dwell
in heaven, the worm upon earth to abide on earth. He made not the Angel to creep in the
mud, nor the worm to move in heaven. He hath assigned dwellers to their different abodes;
incorruption He assigned to incorruptible abodes, corruptible things to corruptible abodes.
Observe the whole, praise the whole. He then who ordered the limbs of the worm, doth He
not govern the clouds? And wherefore raineth He into the sea? As though there are not in
the sea things which are nourished by rain; as though He made not fishes therein, as though
He made not living creatures therein. Observe how the fishes run to sweet water. And
wherefore, saith he, doth He give rain to the fishes, and sometimes giveth not rain to me?
That thou mayest consider that thou art in a desert region, and in a pilgrimage of life; that
so this present life may grow bitter to thee, that thou mayest long for the life to come: or
else that thou mayest be scourged, punished, amended. And how well doth He assign their
properties to regions. Behold, since we have spoken of Getulia, He raineth here nearly every
year, and giveth corn every year; here the corn cannot be kept, it soon rotteth, because it is
given every year; there, because it is given seldom, both much is given, and it can be kept
for long. But dost thou perchance think that God there deserteth man, or that they do not
there after their own manner of rejoicing both praise and glorify God? Take a Getulian from
his country, and set him amid our pleasant trees; he will wish to flee away, and return to his
bare Getulia. To all places then, regions, seasons, God hath assigned and arranged what fits
them. Who could unfold it? Yet they who have eyes see many things therein: when seen,
they please; pleasing, they are praised; not they really, but He who made them; thus shall all
things praise God.
9. It was in thought of this that the spirit of the Prophet added the words, “which do
His word.” Think not then that these things are moved by chance, which in every motion
of theirs obey God. Whither God willeth, thither the fire spreads, thither the cloud hurries,
whether it carry in it rain, or snow, or hail. And wherefore doth the lightning sometimes
strike the mountain, yet strikes not the robber?…Perhaps He yet seeketh the robber’s con-
version, and therefore is the mountain which feareth not smitten, that the man who feareth
may be changed. Thou also sometimes, when maintaining discipline, smitest the ground to
terrify a child. Sometimes too He smiteth a man, whom He will. But thou sayest to me, Be-
hold, He smiteth the more innocent, and passeth over the more guilty. Wonder not; death,
whencesoever it come, is good to the good man. And whence dost thou know what punish-
ment is reserved in secret for that more guilty man, if he be unwilling to be converted?
Would not they rather be scorched by lightning, to whom it shall be said in the end, “Depart
into everlasting fire”?5970 The needful thing is, that thou be guileless. Why so? Is it an evil
5970 Matt. xxv. 41.
Psalm CXLVIII
thing to die by shipwreck, and a good thing to die by fever? Whether he die in this way or
in that, ask what sort of man he is who dieth; ask whither he will go after death, not how he
is to depart from life.…Whatever then happeneth here contrary to our wish, thou wilt know
that it happeneth not, save by the will of God, by His providence, by His ordering, by His
nod, by His laws: and if we understand not why anything is done, let us grant to His
providence that it is not done without reason: so shall we not be blasphemers. For when we
begin to argue concerning the works of God, “why is this?” “why is that?” and, “He ought
not to have done this,” “He did this ill;” where is the praise of God? Thou hast lost thy Hal-
leluia. Regard all things in such wise as to please God and praise the Creator. For if thou
wert to happen to enter the workshop of a smith, thou wouldest not dare to find fault with
his bellows, his anvils, his hammers. But take an ignorant man, who knows not for what
purpose each thing is, and he findeth fault with all. But if he have not the skill of the workman,
and have but the reasoning power of a man, what saith he to himself? Not without reason
are the bellows placed here: the workman knoweth wherefore, though I know not. In the
shop he dareth not to find fault with the smith, yet in the universe he dareth to find fault
with God. Therefore just as “fire, hail, snow, ice, wind of storms, which do His word,” so
all things in nature, which seem to foolish persons to be made at random, simply “do His
word,” because they are not made save by His command.
10. Then he mentioneth, that they may praise the Lord, “mountains and hills, fruitful
trees and all cedars” (ver. 9): “beasts and all cattle, creeping things, and winged fowls” (ver.
10). Then he goeth to men; “kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the
earth” (ver. 11): “young men and maidens, old men and young, let them praise the Name
of the Lord” (ver. 12). Ended is the praise from heaven, ended is the praise from earth. “For
His Name only is exalted” (ver. 13). Let no man seek to exalt his own name. Wilt thou be
exalted? Subject thyself to Him who cannot be humbled. “His confession is in earth and
heaven” (ver. 14). What is “His confession”? Is it the confession wherewith He confesseth?
No, but that whereby all things confess Him, all things cry aloud: the beauty of all things is
in a manner their voice, whereby they praise God. The heaven crieth out to God, “Thou
madest me, not I myself.” Earth crieth out, “Thou createdst me, not I myself.” How do they
cry out? When thou regardest them, and findest this out, they cry out by thy voice, they cry
out by thy regard. Regard the heavens, it is beautiful: observe the earth, it is beautiful: both
together are very beautiful. He made them, He ruleth them, by His nod they are swayed, He
ordereth their seasons, He reneweth their movements, by Himself He reneweth them. All
these things then praise Him, whether in stillness or in motion, whether from earth below
or from heaven above, whether in their old state or in their renewal. When thou seest all
these things, and rejoicest, and art lifted up to the Maker, and gazest on “His invisible things
understood by the things which are made,”5971 “His confession is in earth and heaven:” that
5971 Rom. i. 20.
Psalm CXLVIII
is, thou confesseth to Him from things on earth, thou confesseth to Him from things in
heaven. And since He made all things, and nought is better than He, whatsoever He made
is less than He, and whatsoever in these things pleaseth thee, is less than He. Let not then
what He hath made so please thee, as to withdraw thee from Him who made: if thou lovest
what He made, love much more Him who made. If the things which He hath made are
beautiful, how much more beautiful is He who made them. “And He shall exalt the horn of
His people.” Behold what Haggai and Zachariah prophesied. Now the “horn of His people”
is humble in afflictions, in tribulations, in temptations, in beating of the breast; when will
He “exalt the horn of His people”? When the Lord hath come, and our Sun is risen, not the
sun which is seen with the eye, and “riseth upon the good and the evil,” 5972 but That
whereof is said, To you that hear God, “the Sun of Righteousness shall rise, and healing in
His wings;”5973 and of whom the proud and wicked shall hereafter say, “The light of right-
eousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us.”5974 This
shall be our summer. Now during the winter weather the fruits appear not on the stock;
thou observest, so to say, dead trees during the winter. He who cannot see truly, thinketh
the vine dead; perhaps there is one near it which is really dead; both are alike during winter;
the one is alive, the other is dead, but both the life and death are hidden: summer advanceth;
then the life of the one shineth brightly, the death of the other is manifested: the splendour
of leaves, the abundance of fruit, cometh forth, the vine is clothed in outward appearance
from what it hath in its stock. Therefore, brethren, now we are the same as other men: just
as they are born, eat, drink, are clothed, pass their life, so also do the saints. Sometimes the
very truth deceiveth men, and they say, “Lo, he hath begun to be a Christian: hath he lost
his headache?” or, “because he is a Christian, what gaineth he from me?” O dead vine, thou
observest near thee a vine that is bare indeed in winter, yet not dead. Summer will come,
the Lord will come, our Splendour, that was hidden in the stock, and then “He shall exalt
the horn of His people,” after the captivity wherein we live in this mortal life.…
11. “An hymn to all His Saints.” Know ye what an hymn is? It is a song with praise of
God. If thou praisest God and singest not, thou utterest no hymn: if thou singest and praisest
not God, thou utterest no hymn: if thou praisest aught else, which pertaineth not to the
praise of God, although thou singest and praisest, thou utterest no hymn. An hymn then
containeth these three things, song, and praise, and that of God. Praise then of God in song
is called an hymn. What then meaneth, “An hymn to all His Saints”? Let His Saints receive
an hymn: let His Saints utter an hymn: for this is what they are to receive in the end, an
everlasting hymn.…

Psalm CXLVIII
Psalm CXLIX.5975
1. Let us praise the Lord both in voice, and in understanding, and in good works; and,
as this Psalm exhorteth, let us sing unto Him a new song. It beginneth: “Sing ye to the Lord
a new song. His praise is in the Church of the Saints” (ver. 1). The old man hath an old song,
the new man a new song. The Old Testament is an old song, the New Testament a new song.
In the Old Testament are temporal and earthly promises. Whoso loveth earthly things singeth
an old song: let him that desireth to sing a new song, love the things of eternity. Love itself
is new and eternal; therefore is it ever new, because it never groweth old.…And this song
is of peace, this song is of charity. Whoso severeth himself from the union of the saints,
singeth not a new song; for he hath followed old strife, not new charity. In new charity what
is there? Peace, the bond of an holy society, a spiritual union, a building of living stones.
Where is this? Not in one place, but throughout the whole world. This is said in another
Psalm, “Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.”5976 From this is understood, that he who singeth
not with the whole earth, singeth an old song, whatever words proceed out of his mouth.…We
have already said, brethren, that all the earth singeth a new song. He who singeth not with
the whole earth a new song, let him sing what he will, let his tongue sound forth Halleluia,
let him utter it all day and all night, my ears are not so much bent to hear the voice of the
singer, but I seek the deeds of the doer. For I ask, and say, “What is it that thou singest?”
He answereth, “Halleluia.” What is “Halleluia”? “Praise ye the Lord.” Come, let us praise
the Lord together. If thou praisest the Lord, and I praise the Lord, why are we at variance?
Charity praiseth the Lord, discord blasphemeth the Lord.”…
2. The field of the Lord is the world, not Africa. It is not with the Lord’s field, as it is
without these fields of ours, where Getulia bears sixty or an hundred fold, Numidia only
ten fold: everywhere fruit is borne to Him, both an hundred fold, and sixty fold, and thirty
fold: only do thou choose what thou wilt be, if thou thinkest to belong to the Lord’s Cross.
“The Church” then “of the saints” is the Catholic Church. The Church of the saints is not
the Church of heretics. The Church of the saints is that which God first prefigured before
it was seen, and then set forth that it might be seen. The Church of the saints was heretofore
in writings, now it is in nations: the Church of the saints was heretofore only read of, now
it is both read of and seen. When it was only read of, it was believed; now it is seen, and is
spoken against. His praise is in the “children of the kingdom,” that is, “the Church of the
saints.”
3. “Let Israel rejoice in Him who made Him” (ver. 2). What is, “Israel”? “Seeing God.”
He who seeth God, rejoiceth in Him by whom he was made. What is it then, brethren? we
have said that we belong to the Church of the saints: do we already see God? and how are
5975 Lat. CXLIX. Sermon to the people.
5976 Ps. xcvi. 1.
Psalm CXLIX
Psalm CXLIX
we Israel, if we see not? There is one kind of sight belonging to this present time; there will
be another belonging to the time hereafter: the sight which now is, is by faith; the sight which
is to be will be in reality. If we believe, we see; if we love, we see: see what? God. Ask John:
“God is love;”5977 let us bless His holy Name, and rejoice in God by rejoicing in love. Whoso
hath love, why send we him afar to see God? Let him regard his own conscience, and there
he seeth God.…“And let the sons of Sion exult in their King.” The sons of the Church are
Israel. For Sion indeed was one city, which fell: amid its ruins certain saints dwelt after the
flesh: but the true Sion, the true Jerusalem (for Sion and Jerusalem are one), is “eternal in
the heavens,” 5978 and is “our mother.”5979 She it is that hath given us birth, she is the Church
of the saints, she hath nourished us, she, who is in part a pilgrim, in part abiding in the
heavens. In the part which abideth in heaven is the bliss of angels, in the part which wandereth
in this world is the hope of the righteous. Of the former is said, “Glory to God in the highest;”
of the latter, “and on earth peace to men of good will.”5980 Let those then who, being in this
life, groan, and long for their country, run by love, not by bodily feet; let them seek not ships
but wings, let them lay hold on the two wings of love. What are the two wings of love? The
love of God, and of our neighbour. For now we are pilgrims, we sigh, we groan. There has
come to us a letter from our country: we read it to you. “And the sons of Sion shall exult in
their King.” The Son of God, who made us, was made one of us: and He rules us as our King,
because He is our Creator, who made us. But He by whom we were made is the same as He
by whom we are ruled, and we are Christians because He is Christ. He is called Christ from
Chrism, that is, Anointing.…Give to the Priest somewhat to offer. What could man find
which he could give as a clean victim? What victim? what clean thing can a sinner offer? O
unrighteous, O sinful man, whatever thou offerest is unclean, and somewhat that is clean
must be offered for thee.…Let then the Priest that is clean offer Himself, and cleanse thee.
This is what Christ did. He found in man nothing clean for Him to offer for man: He offered
Himself as a clean Victim. Happy Victim, true Victim, spotless Offering. He offered not
then what we gave Him; yea rather, He offered what He took of us, and offered it clean. For
of us He took flesh, and this He offered. But where took He it? In the womb of the Virgin
Mary, that He might offer it clean for us unclean. He is our King, He is our Priest, in Him
let us rejoice.
4. “Let them praise His Name in chorus” (ver. 3). What meaneth “chorus”? Many know
what a “chorus” is: nay, as we are speaking in a town, almost all know. A “chorus” is the
union of singers. If we sing “in chorus,” let us sing in concord. If any one’s voice is out of

Psalm CXLIX
harmony in a chorus of singers, it offendeth the ear, and throweth the chorus into confusion.
If the voice of one echoing discordantly troubleth the harmony of them who sing, how doth
the discord of heresy throw into confusion the harmony of them who praise. The whole
world is now the chorus of Christ. The chorus of Christ soundeth harmoniously from east
to west.5981 “Let them sing a psalm unto Him with timbrel and psaltery.” Wherefore taketh
he to him the “timbrel and psaltery”? That not the voice alone may praise, but the works
too. When timbrel and psaltery are taken, the hands harmonize with the voice. So too do
thou, whensoever thou singest “Halleluia,” deal forth thy bread to the hungry, clothe the
naked, take in the stranger: then doth not only thy voice sound, but thy hand soundeth in
harmony with it, for thy deeds agree with thy words. Thou hast taken to thee an instrument,
and thy fingers agree with thy tongue. Nor must we keep back the mystical meaning of the
“timbrel and psaltery.” On the timbrel leather is stretched, on the psaltery gut is stretched;
on either instrument the flesh is crucified. How well did he “sing a psalm on timbrel and
psaltery,” who said, “the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world”?5982 This psaltery
or timbrel He wishes thee to take up, who loveth a new song, who teacheth thee, saying to
thee, “Whosoever willeth to be My disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow Me.”5983 Let him not set down his psaltery, let him not set down his timbrel, let him
stretch himself out on the wood, and be dried from the lust of the flesh. The more the strings
are stretched, the more sharply do they sound. The Apostle Paul then, in order that his
psaltery might sound sharply, what said he? “Stretching forth unto those things which are
before,” etc.5984 He stretched himself: Christ touched him; and the sweetness of truth
sounded.
5. “For the Lord hath dealt kindly among His people” (ver. 4). What dealing so kindly,
as to die for the ungodly? What dealing so kindly, as with righteous Blood to blot out the
handwriting against the sinner? What dealing so kindly, as to say, “I regard not what ye
were, be ye now what ye were not”? He dealeth kindly in converting him that was turned
away, in aiding him that is fighting, in crowning the conqueror. “And the meek He shall lift
up in salvation.” For the proud too are lifted up, but not in salvation: the meek are lifted in
salvation, the proud in death: that is, the proud lift up themselves, and God humbleth them:
the meek humble themselves, and God lifteth them up.
6. “The saints shall exult in glory” (ver. 5). I would say somewhat important about the
glory of the saints. For there is no one who loveth not glory. But the glory of fools, popular
glory as it is called, hath snares to deceive, so that a man, influenced by the praises of vain

Psalm CXLIX
men, shall be willing to live in such fashion as to be spoken of by men, whosoever they be,
in whatsoever way. Hence it is that men, rendered mad, and puffed up with pride, empty
within, without swollen, are willing ever to ruin their fortunes by bestowing them on stage-
players, actors, men who fight with wild beasts, charioteers. What sums they give, what
sums they spend! They lavish the powers not only of their patrimony, but of their minds
too. They scorn the poor, because the people shouteth not that the poor should be given to,
but the people do shout that the fighter with wild beasts be given to. When then no shout
is raised to them, they refuse to spend; when madmen shout to them, they are mad too: nay,
all are mad, both performer, and spectator, and the giver. This mad glory is blamed by the
Lord, is offensive in the eyes of the Almighty.…Thou choosest to clothe the fighter with
wild beasts, who may be beaten, and make thee blush: Christ is never conquered; He hath
conquered the devil, He hath conquered for thee, and to thee, and in thee; such a conqueror
as this thou choosest not to clothe. Wherefore? Because there is less shouting, less madness
about it. They then who delight in such glory, have an empty conscience. Just as they drain
their chests, to send garments as presents, so do they empty their conscience, so as to have
nothing precious therein.
7. But the saints who “exult in glory,” no need is there for us to say how they exult: just
hear the verse of the Psalm which followeth: “The saints shall exult in glory, they shall rejoice
in their beds:” not in theatres, or amphitheatres, or circuses, or follies, or market places, but
“in their chambers.” What is, “in their chambers”? In their hearts.5985 Hear the Apostle Paul
exulting in his closet: “For this is our glory, the testimony of our conscience.”5986 On the
other hand, there is reason to fear lest any be pleasing to himself, and so seem to be proud,
and boast of his conscience. For every one ought to exult with fear, for that wherein he ex-
ulteth is God’s gift, not his own desert. For there be many that please themselves, and think
themselves righteous; and there is another passage which goeth against them, which saith,
“Who shall boast that he hath a clean heart, and that he is pure from sin?” 5987 There is
then, so to speak, a limit to glorying in our conscience, namely, to know that thy faith is
sincere, thy hope sure, thy love without dissimulation. “The exultations of God are in their
mouths” (ver. 6). In such wise shall they “rejoice in their closets,” as not to attribute to
themselves that they are good, but praise Him from whom they have what they are, by whom
they are called to attain to what they are not, and from whom they hope for perfection, to
whom they give thanks, because He hath begun.
5985 [There is a play here on the word cubile, which was used of a box in the theatre. Cubile often means a
small apartment, and this is our author’s idea. Matt. vi. 6. Elsewhere he speaks of the “closet” as the heart.” I
vary the text accordingly.—C.]
5986 2 Cor. i. 12.
5987 Prov. xx. 9.
Psalm CXLIX
8. “And swords5988 sharpened on both sides in their hands.” This sort of weapon contains
a great mystical meaning, in that it is sharp on both sides. By “swords sharpened on both
sides,” we understand the Word of the Lord:5989 it is one sword, but therefore are they called
many, because there are many mouths and many tongues of the saints. How is it two edged?
It speaks of things temporal, it speaks also of things eternal. In both cases it proveth what
it saith, and him whom it strikes, it severeth from the world. Is not this the sword whereof
the Lord said, “I am not come to send peace upon earth, but a sword”?5990 Observe how
He came to divide, how He came to sever. He divideth the saints, He divideth the ungodly,
He severeth from thee that which hindereth thee. The son willeth to serve God, the father
willeth not: the sword cometh, the Word of God cometh, and severeth the son from the
father.…Wherefore then is it in their hands, not in their tongues? “And swords,” it saith,
“sharpened on both sides in their hands.” By “in their hands,” he meaneth in power. They
received then the word of God in power, to speak where they would, to whom they would,
neither to fear power, nor to despise poverty. For they had in their hands a sword; where
they would they brandished it, handled it, smote with it: and all this was in the power of the
preachers. For if the Word be not in their hands, why is it written, “The Word of the Lord
was put in the hand of the Prophet Haggai”?5991 Surely, brethren, God set not His Word in
His fingers. What is meant by, “was put in his hand”? It was put into his power to preach
the Word of the Lord. Lastly, we can understand these “hands” in another way also. For
they who spake had the word of God in their tongues, they who wrote, in their hands.
9. Now, brethren, ye see the saints armed: observe the slaughter, observe their glorious
battles. For if there be a commander, there must be soldiers; if soldiers, an enemy; if a warfare,
a victory. What have these done who had in their hands swords sharpened on both sides?
“To do vengeance on the nations.” See whether vengeance have not been done on the nations.
Daily is it done: we do it ourselves by speaking. Observe how the nations of Babylon are
slain. She is repaid twofold: for so is it written of her, “repay her double for what she hath
done.”5992 How is she repaid double? The saints wage war, they draw their “swords twice
sharpened;” thence come defeats, slaughters, severances: how is she repaid double? When
she had power to persecute the Christians, she slew the flesh indeed, but she crushed not
God: now she is repaid double, for the Pagans are extinguished and the idols are
broken.…And lest thou shouldest think that men are really smitten with the sword, blood

only on one side, which are called machæræ. But these frameæ are also called romphææ and spatæ.”—C.]

really shed, wounds made in the flesh, he goeth on and explaineth, “upbraidings among the
peoples.” What is “upbraidings”? Reproof. Let the “sword twice sharpened” go forth from
you, delay not. Say to thy friend, if yet thou hast one5993 left to whom to say it, “What kind
of man art thou, who hast abandoned Him by whom thou wast made, and worshippest what
He made? Better is the Workman, than that which He worketh.” When he beginneth to
blush, when he beginneth to feel compunction, thou hast made a wound with thy sword, it
hath reached the heart, he is about to die, that he may live.
10. “That they may bind their kings in fetters, and their nobles in bonds of iron” (ver.
8). “To execute upon them the judgment written” (ver. 9). The kings of the Gentiles are to
be bound in fetters, “and their nobles in fetters,” and that “of iron.”…For these verses which
we are beginning to explain are obscure. For for this purpose God willed to set down some
of His verses obscurely, not that anything new should be dug out of them, but that what
was already well known, might be made new by being obscurely set forth. We know that
kings have been made Christians; we know that the nobles of the Gentiles have been made
Christians. They are being made so at this day; they have been, they shall be; the “swords
twice sharpened” are not idle in the hands of the saints. How then do we understand their
being bound in fetters and chains of iron? Ye know, beloved and learned brethren (learned
I call you, for ye have been nourished in the Church, and are accustomed to hear God’s
Word read),5994 that “God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the strong,
and the foolish things of the world hath God chosen to confound the wise, and things which
are not, just as things which are, that the things which are may be brought to nought.”5995…It
is said by the Lord, “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor,
and come, follow Me, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.”5996 Many of the nobles did
this, but they ceased to be nobles of the Gentiles, they chose rather to be poor in this world,
noble in Christ. But many retain their former nobility, retain their royal powers, and yet
are Christians. These are, as it were, “in fetters and in bonds of iron.” How so? they received
fetters, to keep them from going to things unlawful, the “fetters of wisdom,”5997 the fetters
of the Word of God. Wherefore then are they bonds of iron and not bonds of gold? They
are iron so long as they fear: let them love, and they shall be golden. Observe, beloved, what
I say. Ye have heard just now the Apostle John, “There is no fear in love, but perfect love
casteth out fear, because fear hath torment.”5998 This is the bond of iron. And yet unless a

Psalm CXLIX
man begin through fear to worship God, he will not attain to love. “The fear of the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom.”5999 The beginning then is bonds of iron, the end a collar of gold.
For it is said of wisdom, “a collar of gold around thy neck.”6000…There cometh to us a man
powerful in this world, his wife offendeth him, and perhaps he hath desired another man’s
wife who is more beautiful, or another woman who is richer, he wisheth to put away the
one he hath, yet he doeth it not. He heareth the words of the servant of God, he heareth the
Prophet, he heareth the Apostle, and he doeth it not; he is told by one in whose hands is a
“sword twice sharpened,” “Thou shalt not do it: it is not lawful for thee: God alloweth thee
not to put away thy wife, “save for the cause of fornication.”6001 He heareth this, he feareth,
and doeth it not.…Listen, young men; the bonds are of iron, seek not to set your feet within
them; if ye do, ye shall be bound more tightly with fetters. Such fetters the hands of the
Bishop make strong for you. Do not men who are thus fettered fly to the Church, and are
here loosed? Men do fly hither, desiring to be rid of their wives: here they are more tightly
bound: no man looseth these fetters. “What God joined together, let not man put asun-
der.”6002 But these bonds are hard. Who but knows it? This hardness the Apostles grieved
at, and said, “If this be the case with a wife, it is not good to marry.”6003 If the bonds be of
iron, it is not good to set our feet within them. And the Lord said, “All men cannot receive
this saying, but let him that can receive it, receive it.”6004 “Art thou bound unto a wife? seek
not to be freed,” for thou art bound with bonds of iron. “Art thou free from a wife, seek not
a wife;” bind not thyself with bonds of iron.
11. “To do in them the judgment that is written.” This is the judgment which the saints
do throughout all nations. Wherefore “written”? Because these things were before written,
and now are fulfilled. Behold now they are being done: erst they were read, and were not
done. And he hath concluded thus, “this glory have all His saints.” Throughout the whole
world, throughout entire nations, this the saints do, thus are they glorified, thus do they
“exalt God with their mouths,” thus do they “rejoice in their beds,” thus do they “exult in
their glory,” thus are they “lifted up in salvation,” thus do they “sing a new song,” thus in
heart and voice and life they say Halleluia. Amen.

Psalm CXLIX
Psalm CL.6005
1. Although the arrangement of the Psalms, which seems to me to contain the secret of
a mighty mystery, hath not yet been revealed unto me, yet, by the fact that they in all amount
to one hundred and fifty, they suggest somewhat even to us, who have not as yet pierced
with the eye of our mind the depth of their entire arrangement, whereon we may without
being over-bold, so far as God giveth, be able to speak. Firstly, the number fifteen, whereof
it is a multiple this number fifteen, I say, signifieth the agreement of the two Testaments.
For in the former is observed the Sabbath, which signifieth rest; in the latter the Lord’s Day,
which signifieth resurrection. The Sabbath is the seventh day, but the Lord’s Day, coming
after the seventh, must needs be the eighth, and is also to be reckoned the first. For it is
called the first day of the week,6006 and so from it are reckoned the second, third, fourth,
and so on to the seventh day of the week, which is the Sabbath. But from Lord’s Day to
Lord’s Day is eight days, wherein is declared the revelation of the New Testament, which
in the Old was as it were veiled under earthly promises. Further, seven and eight make fifteen.
Of the same number too are the Psalms which are called “of the steps,” because that was the
number of the steps of the Temple. Further too, the number fifty in itself also containeth a
great mystery.6007 For it consisteth of a week of weeks, with the addition of one as an eighth
to complete the number of fifty. For seven times seven make forty-nine, whereto one is added
to make fifty. And this number fifty is of so great meaning, that it was after the completion
of that number of days from the Lord’s Resurrection, that, on the fiftieth day exactly, the
Holy Spirit came upon those who were gathered together in Christ. And this Holy Spirit is
in Scripture especially spoken of by the number seven, whether in Isaiah or in the Apocalypse,
where the seven Spirits of God are most directly mentioned, on account of the sevenfold
operation of one and the self-same Spirit.6008 And this sevenfold operation is mentioned
in Isaiah.6009…Hence also the Holy Spirit is spoken of under the number seven. But this
period of fifty the Lord divided into forty and ten: for on the fortieth day after His Resurrec-
tion He ascended into heaven, and then after ten days were completed He sent the Holy
Spirit: under the number forty setting forth to us the period of temporal sojourn in this
world. For the number four prevaileth in forty; and the world and the year have each four
parts; and by the addition of the number ten, as a sort of reward added for the fulfilment of
the law in good works, eternity itself is figured. This fifty the number one hundred and fifty

containeth three times, as though it were multiplied by the Trinity. Wherefore for this
reason too we make out that this number of the Psalm is not unsuitable.6010
2. Now in that some have believed that the Psalms are divided into five books, they have
been led by the fact, that so often at the end of Psalms are the words, “so be it, so be it.” But
when I endeavoured to make out the principle of this division, I was not able; for neither
are the five parts equal one to another, neither in quantity of contents, nor yet even in
number of Psalms, so as for each to contain thirty. And if each book end with, “so be it, so
be it,” we may reasonably ask, why the fifth and last book hath not the same conclusion.
We however, following the authority of canonical Scripture, where it is said, “For it is written
in the book of Psalms,”6011 know that there is but one book of Psalms. And I see indeed
how this can be true, and yet the other be true also, without contravening it. For it may be
that there was some custom in Hebrew literature, whereby that is called one book which
yet consists of more than one, just as of many churches one church consisteth, and of many
heavens one heaven,6012…and one land of many lands. For it is our everyday habit to say,
“the globe6013 of the earth,” and “the globe of the lands.” And when it is said, “It is written
in the book of Psalms,” though the customary way of speaking is such that he seem to have
wished to suggest that there is but one book, yet to this it may be answered, that the words
mean “in a book of the Psalms,” that is, “in any one of those five books.” And this is in
common language so unprecedented, or at least so rare, that we are only convinced that the
twelve Prophets made one book, because we read in like manner, “As it is written in the
book of the Prophets.”6014 There are some too who call all the canonical Scriptures together
one book,6015 because they agree in a very wondrous and divine unity.…
3. Whichever then of these is understood, this book, in its parts of fifty Psalms each,
gives an answer important and very worthy of consideration. For it seems to me not without
6010 [He adds: “For in the number of the fishes too which were caught in the nets which were let down after
the Resurrection, by the adding of three to one hundred and fifty, we seem to have a kind of suggestion given
us, into how many parts that number ought to be divided, namely, that it should contain three fifties. Though
there is another account too of that number of fishes, one much more deep and pleasing, namely, that we arrive
at the same number, by setting down seventeen in a column, and adding all the numbers from one to seventeen
together. But in the number ten is signified the Law, in seven, Grace; for nought fulfilleth the Law save ‘Love
(Rom. v. 5) by the Holy Spirit,’ who is set forth under the number seven.”—C.]

significance, that the fiftieth is of penitence, the hundredth of mercy and judgment, the
hundred and fiftieth of the praise of God in His saints. For thus do we advance to an ever-
lasting life of happiness, first by condemning our own sins, then by living aright, that, having
condemned our ill life, and lived a good life, we may attain to everlasting life. Our predes-
tination is not wrought in ourselves, but in secret with Him, in His foreknowledge.6016 But
we are called by the preaching of repentance. We are justified in the calling of mercy and
fear of judgment. He feareth not judgment, who hath previously attained salvation. Being
called, we renounce the devil by repentance, that we may not continue under his yoke: being
justified, we are healed by mercy, that we may not fear judgment: being glorified, we pass
into everlasting life, where we praise God without end.…The verse wherewith this Psalm
concludeth is the voice of life everlasting.
4. “Praise the Lord in His saints,” that is, in those whom He hath glorified: “praise Him
in the firmament of His power” (ver. 1). “Praise Him in His deeds of strength;” or, as others
have explained it, “in His deeds of power: praise Him according to the multitude of His
greatness” (ver. 2). All these His saints are; as the Apostle saith, “But we may be the right-
eousness of God in Him.”6017 If then they be the righteousness of God, which He hath
wrought in them, why are they not also the strength of Christ which He hath wrought in
them, that they should rise again from the dead? For in Christ’s resurrection, “strength” is
especially set forth to us, for in His Passion was weakness, as the Apostle saith.6018 And well
doth it say, “the firmament of His power.” For it is the “firmament of His power” that He
“dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over Him.”6019 Why should not they also
be called “the works of” God’s “strength,” which He hath done in them: yea rather, they
themselves are the works of His strength; just as it is said, “We are the righteousness of God
in Him.” For what more powerful than that He should reign for ever, with all His enemies
put under His feet? Why should not they also be “the multitude of His greatness”? not that
whereby He is great, but whereby He hath made them great, many as they are, that is,
thousands of thousands. Just as righteousness too is understood in two ways, that whereby
He is righteous, and that which He worketh in us, so as to make us His righteousness. These
same saints are signified by all the musical instruments in succession, to praise God in. For
what the Psalmist began with, saying, “Praise the Lord in His saints,” that he carrieth out,
signifying in various ways these same saints of His.
5. “Praise Him in the sound of the trumpet” (ver. 3): on account of the surpassing
clearness of note of their praise. “Praise Him in the psaltery and harp.” The psaltery praiseth

Psalm CL
God from things above, the harp praiseth God from things below; I mean, from things in
heaven, and things in earth, as He who made heaven and earth. We have already in another
Psalm,6020 explained that the psaltery hath that board, whereon the series of strings rests
that it may give a better sound, above, whereas the harp has it below. “Praise Him in the
timbrel and choir” (ver. 4). The “timbrel” praiseth God when the flesh is now changed, so
that there is in it no weakness of earthly corruption. For the timbrel is made of leather dried
and strengthened. The “choir” praiseth God when society made peaceful praiseth Him.
“Praise Him on the strings and organ.” Both psaltery and harp, which have been mentioned
above, have strings. But “organ” is a general name for all instruments of music, although
usage has now obtained that those are specially called organ which are inflated with bellows:
but I do not think that this kind is meant here.6021 For since organ is a Greek word, applied
generally, as I have said, to all musical instruments, this instrument, to which bellows are
applied, is called by the Greeks by another name: but it being called organ is rather a Latin
and conversational usage. When then he saith, “on the strings and organ,” he seemeth to
me to have intended to signify some instrument which hath strings. For it is not psalteries
and harps only that have strings: but, because in the psaltery, and harp, on account of the
sound from things below and things above, somewhat has been found which can be under-
stood after this distinction, he hath suggested to us to seek some other meaning in the strings
themselves: for they too are flesh, but flesh now set free from corruption. And to those, it
may be, he added the organ, to signify that they sound not each separately, but sound together
in most harmonious diversity, just as they are arranged in a musical instrument. For even
then the saints of God will have their differences, accordant, not discordant, that is, agreeing,
not disagreeing, just as sweetest harmony arises from sounds differing indeed, but not op-
posed to one another.
6. “Praise Him on the well-sounding cymbals, praise Him on cymbals of jubilation”
(ver. 5). Cymbals touch one another in order to sound, and therefore are by some compared
to our lips. But I think it better to understand that God is in a manner praised on the cymbal,
when each is honoured by his neighbour, not by himself, and then honouring one another,
they give praise to God. But lest any should understand such cymbals as sound without life,
therefore I think he added, “on cymbals of jubilation.” For “jubilation” that is, unspeakable
praise, proceedeth not, save from life. Nor do I think that I should pass over what musicians
say, that there are three kinds of sounds, by voice, by breath, by striking: by voice, uttered
by throat and windpipe, when man singeth without any instrument; by breath, as by pipe,
or anything of that sort: by striking, as by harp, or anything of that kind. None then of these
kinds is omitted here: for there is voice in the choir, breath in the trumpet, striking in the
6020 See vol. i. p. 312.
6021 [See p. 229, note 1, supra.—C.]
Psalm CL
harp, representing mind, spirit, body,6022 but by similitudes, not in the proper sense of the
words. When then he proposed, “Praise God in His saints,” to whom said he this, save to
themselves? And in whom are they to praise God, save in themselves? For ye, saith he, are
“His saints;” ye are “His strength,” but that which He wrought in you; ye are “His mighty
works, and the multitude of His greatness,” which He hath wrought and set forth in you.
Ye are “trumpet, psaltery, harp, timbrel, choir, strings, and organ, cymbals of jubilation
sounding well,” because sounding in harmony. All these are ye: let nought that is vile, nought
that is transitory, nought that is ludicrous, be here thought of. And since to savour of the
flesh is death, “let every spirit praise the Lord” (ver. 6).
Prayer of St. Augustin.
Which he was wont to use after his Sermons and Lectures.
Turn we to the Lord God, the Father Almighty, and with pure hearts offer to Him, so
far as our meanness can, great and true thanks, with all our hearts praying His exceeding
kindness, that of His good pleasure He would deign to hear our prayers, that by His Power
He would drive out the enemy from our deeds and thoughts, that He would increase our
faith, guide our understandings, give us spiritual thoughts, and lead us to His bliss, through
Jesus Christ His Son our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Him, in the Unity of the Holy
Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.

Commentary on Psalms - Volume 1 by John Calvin
Calvin found Psalms to be one of the richest books in the Bible. As he writes in the introduc-
tion, "there is no other book in which we are more perfectly taught the right manner of
praising God, or in which we are more powerfully stirred up to the performance of this re-
ligious exercise." This commentary--the last Calvin wrote--clearly expressed Calvin's deep
love for this book. Calvin's Commentary on Psalms is thus one of his best commentaries,
and one can greatly profit from reading even a portion of it.
